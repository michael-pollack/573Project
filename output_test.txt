When a tumour is removed from the body , the cancer cells that remain in the tumour are lost to analysis . However , once the cancer cells have left the tumour body , they become indistinguishable from the cells surrounding the tumour . This means that it is not possible to identify the cells that have left the tumour body . However , it is possible to identify the cells that have left the tumour body by staining them with a marker called EpCAM , which is found on the surface of epithelial cells . This marker can be used to identify cells that have left the tumour body .

This strategy is known as ‘neural filtering’ , and it has been shown to help older people to understand speech . However , it is not clear whether this strategy also helps to compensate for the loss of hearing .

In ancient Greece and Rome , the use of botanical drugs was based on the perception of their taste and smell . In ancient Greece and Rome , the use of botanical drugs was based on the perception of their taste and smell . In ancient Greece and Rome , the expected effects of botanical drugs were explained by their taste and according to the prevailing medical theory , disease resulted from a disequilibrium between bodily fluids or humours including phlegm , blood , yellow bile and black bile .

The human body contains a vast amount of nutrients , including proteins , fats and sugars . However , these nutrients can also be toxic to the bacteria that live in the body , which can lead to serious infections . Enterobacteriaceae , a group of bacteria that includes Salmonella Typhimurium IR715 , are known to be particularly harmful to the human body . These bacteria live in the blood , where they can cause severe bleeding , which can lead to organ failure and death . To investigate how these bacteria survive and thrive in the blood , Chen et al .

Male sperm cells are the most common type of sperm in the human body , and are responsible for producing the majority of the sperm that are used to impregnate women . However , male sperm cells are not the only type of sperm cell in the human body . Male germ cells , which are found in the testis , are also responsible for producing sperm . However , it is not clear exactly how male germ cells evolved to become sperm cells . Male germ cells share a common origin across animal species , and therefore they likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity .

Eukaryotes are a group of organisms that live in the ocean , including jellyfish , corals , sponges , and crustaceans . Eukaryotes have two types of flagellum , each of which has a different role in swimming . One flagellum is called the cis flagellum , and the other is called the trans flagellum . The cis flagellum is the first to beat , and the trans flagellum is the last to beat .

Obesity is a major public health problem in the United States , with more than half of the adult population estimated to be overweight or obese . Obesity is linked to a number of diseases , including type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease and cancer . One of the most common causes of obesity is the accumulation of fat in the body , which can lead to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease and cancer .

Fear is one of the most important emotions in our lives , and it is important for us to be able to recognize and respond to threats . For example , if we are threatened by a predator , we may be able to recognize the predator’s scent and respond accordingly . However , if we are threatened by a predator , we may not be able to recognize the predator’s scent and respond accordingly . This phenomenon is known as associative learning , and it is important to understand how this process works .

The brain is made up of many different types of neurons , each of which has a specific role . For example , a neuron in the left hemisphere of an insect’s brain will fire when the insect flies , while a neuron in the right hemisphere of the insect’s brain will fire when the insect flies . This activity pattern is known as a sinusoidal pattern , and it is thought to be common in the brain of insects . However , it is not clear how the sinusoidal pattern can be used to encode the direction of an insect’s head .

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the nervous system . It is caused by mutations in a gene called PINK1 , which encodes a protein called Cisd . Cisd is an iron-sulfur-binding protein that is found in the mitochondria of fruit flies . Cisd binds to a cluster of iron-sulfur molecules in the mitochondrial membrane , and this protein is required for the mitochondria to work properly . However , it is not clear how Cisd is involved in Parkinson’s disease .

Phytoplasmas cause disease in crops , ornamentals and native plants worldwide , and are often dependent on sap-feeding insects , including leafhoppers and plant hoppers , for transmission . Plants infected with phytoplasmas produce a protein called SAP54 , which helps the insects to find mates . However , it was not clear how this protein helps the insects to find mates , and whether it also helps the plants to attract insects . To investigate this question , Wang et al .

Candida albicans is one of the most common fungal infections in humans . It is also one of the most difficult to treat , and is often resistant to antifungal drugs , which are commonly used to treat fungal infections . However , it is not clear how C . albicans is able to tolerate these drugs , and how this tolerance is maintained over time . To address this question , Dohn et al . used a technique called droplet-based transcriptomics to study thousands of individual C . albicans cells . The experiments revealed that C .

Animals , plants , and other animals have evolved to adapt to their environment . For example , some animals have evolved to adapt to their environment by changing their genes , while others have evolved to adapt to their environment by changing their proteins . However , it is not clear exactly how this process works . One way to measure how effective selection is is is to look at how often a particular protein is used to make an amino acid .

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition in which the body’s immune system overreacts to a bacterial infection . This can lead to organ failure and death , and it is often referred to as the ‘silent killer’ . The bacteria that cause sepsis are often found in the bloodstream , but they can also invade other organs , such as the gut , and cause infections in other parts of the body , such as the lungs . The bacteria that cause sepsis release a chemical called ATP into the bloodstream , which is then used by the immune system to fight the infection .

Schizophrenia is a mental illness that is characterized by hallucinations , delusions , and other psychotic symptoms . It is not a direct cause of the disorder , but it is often associated with poor mental health in childhood . Previous research has shown that children with schizophrenia are at higher risk of developing other psychiatric disorders , including mood disorders , anxiety , and substance use disorders . However , it is not clear whether these disorders are caused by schizophrenia , or if they are related to the symptoms of schizophrenia .

The brain is made up of many different types of cells , each of which has a unique identity . Each cell has its own identity , and it is important for the brain to be able to distinguish between different types of cells . A protein called fibroblast growth factor 8 ( or FGF8 for short ) is a key player in this process . FGF8 diffuses from a region of the brain called the isthmus , which is located at the most anterior pole of the brain , to create a gradient that controls the identity of the different types of cells in the brain .

Sleep and feeding patterns are critical for brain development . However , it is not clear how these patterns develop , and how they are maintained throughout life . The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an example of an organism that develops sleep-wake patterns early in life . The larvae of the fruit fly are fed more in the day than in the night , and sleep is consolidated to specific times of day with flies eating more in the day than the night .

Many animals , including humans , use swimming as a way to escape predators . Fish , for example , use swimming as a way to escape predators , but it is not clear how swimming as a group can reduce energy costs . Fish schools , for example , are large groups of fish that swim together at high speeds . The energy costs associated with swimming as a group are not well understood , and it is not clear how swimming as a group can reduce energy costs . To address this question , Chen et al .

The immune system protects the body from invading bacteria and viruses , but it is also responsible for many other biological processes . For example , macrophages are a type of white blood cell that protects the body from infection , and they are thought to play an important role in many diseases , including cancer . However , little is known about the role of macrophages in the immune system , and how they respond to different types of infection . To address this question , Chen et al . studied the role of macrophages in the immune system in mice .

Many animals use the position of the sun or moon to guide their movements . For example , many animals , including humans , use the position of the sun or moon to guide their movements . However , it is not clear whether these animals also use the position of the moon to guide their movements . Bull ants , for example , leave their nest at twilight and return to the nest during the night . The moon reflects sunlight , and the moon’s position in the night sky reflects sunlight .

Pterosaurs , a group of flying reptiles that lived about 100 million years ago , were the first animals to fly . They had long tails , called tail vanes , that extended from the tip of the tail to the tip of the tail . These tail vanes were thought to help the pterosaurs control their flight . However , it was not clear how these tail vanes were able to maintain their stiffness during flight . To investigate this question , Zhang et al . used a technique called laser-induced fluorescence ( L . . . .

Dopamine is a chemical messenger that helps the brain to process information . Dopamine is produced by neurons in the brain’s nucleus accumbens core , which is located in the center of the brain . The nucleus accumbens core is also home to many other brain regions , including the striatum , which is involved in memory , learning and behavior . Dopamine is released from the nucleus accumbens core during adolescence , but it is not clear how this happens .

Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs for short ) are a group of disorders that affect the ability to communicate and interact with others . These disorders are caused by mutations in a gene called 16p11 , which encodes a protein called mTOR . Mutations in 16p11 are associated with autism spectrum disorders , but it is not clear how these mutations contribute to these disorders . To investigate this question , Wang et al . used a technique called induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) to study the brains of six individuals with autism spectrum disorders .

The human brain contains many different types of synapses , each with its own unique characteristics . For example , some synapses in the cochlea , the part of the brain that controls hearing , are more active than others . Other synapses in the brainstem , the part of the brain that controls movement , are more active than others . However , it is not clear how these differences contribute to the diversity of synapses in the human brain . Previous studies have shown that synapses in the cochlea are more active than those in the brainstem .

Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite called Plasmodium , which is transmitted by mosquitoes . The parasite lives in the blood of humans and other animals , and can cause severe illness and death if left untreated . The parasite’s genetic material is stored in a structure called the histone deacetylase ( or histone deacetylase for short ) family . The histone deacetylase family is made up of a number of proteins that bind to the DNA of the parasite . These proteins are known as transcription factors ( or TFs for short ) .

Cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide , and it is also one of the most common causes of mental health problems . The brain is made up of many different types of nerve cells , and the connections between these cells and the rest of the brain have been studied extensively . However , little is known about the connections between the brain and the tumor , and how these connections affect mental health . One way to investigate this question is to use a mouse model of head and neck cancer , which is the most common type of cancer in the United States .

The human coronavirus , or SARS-CoV-2 for short , is a virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , in humans . The virus infects the lungs , liver , and other organs , and is transmitted between humans by droplets of saliva . The virus can also infect other animals , such as mice , and can spread between humans . To date , there have been no effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2 .

Humans and other mammals hibernate for periods of time known as ‘torpor’ . During torpor , the body stops producing energy , which is stored in the tissues of the hibernating animal . However , during hibernation , the tissues of the hibernating animal start to produce more energy , which is stored in the muscles of the animal . This is known as thermogenesis , and it is thought that the energy stored in the muscles of hibernating animals may be used for other purposes . However , it is not clear how the energy stored in the muscles of hibernating animals is used .

The human skeleton is made up of many different types of cells , including bone cells , muscle cells , and fat cells . The skeleton is made up of a structure called the growth plate , which is located at both ends of the skeleton . The growth plate is made up of four zones , each of which consists of different types of cells . These zones are arranged in a column-like structure , which helps to control the rate at which the skeleton grows . The growth plate is made up of four different types of cells , each of which consists of different types of cells .

In humans , the brain is made up of two parts: the auditory cortex and the vocal cortex . The auditory cortex is the part of the brain that processes sounds , and the vocal cortex is the part of the brain that processes vocalization . However , in humans , the auditory cortex is not always active during vocalization , and the vocal cortex is not always sensitive to feedback from the auditory cortex . This suggests that the suppression of the auditory cortex during vocalization is important for the detection of speech errors .

DNA is the building block of every cell in the body , and it must be copied to make proteins . To do this , the DNA must be copied into a molecule called RNA , which is then translated into a protein called a messenger RNA ( or mRNA for short ) . To do this , the mRNA must first be translated into a protein called a nuclease , which then binds to the messenger RNA . The nucleases are made up of a series of proteins called nucleases , each of which has a unique structure .

Caenorhabditis elegans is a small worm that lives in the gut of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans . The worm is known to live longer than most other worms , but it is not clear how , or why , this is the case . A protein called calcineurin is known to increase the lifespan of C . elegans , but it is not clear how , or why , this is the case . Previous studies have shown that blocking calcineurin increases the lifespan of C . elegans .

The human brain is made up of two parts: the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe . The frontal lobe is responsible for processing information , and the parietal lobe is responsible for processing information that is irrelevant to the task at hand . However , the frontal lobe can also process information that is not relevant to the task at hand . For example , when a voice on the left asks you to turn right , the frontal lobe can process information that is irrelevant to the task at hand .

Spontaneous preterm labor is a condition in which the baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy . It is caused by a rupture of the membranes of the uterus , which can lead to the baby being born too early . However , spontaneous preterm labor can also be caused by a rupture of the membranes of the cervix , which can lead to the baby being born too early . The risk of spontaneous preterm labor is higher in women with a history of spontaneous preterm labor . However , it is not clear how the immune system responds to the rupture of the membranes .

The blood vessels that supply the heart and other organs with oxygen and nutrients are surrounded by cells called smooth muscle cells . These cells contract when the blood pressure in the vessel increases , and they can also contract when the blood pressure decreases . However , it is not clear how smooth muscle cells respond to changes in blood pressure . Previous studies have shown that smooth muscle cells respond differently to changes in blood pressure . For example , smooth muscle cells respond differently to changes in blood pressure in males and females . However , it is not clear how smooth muscle cells respond to changes in blood pressure in females .

Decomposition is a key process in the life cycle of plants and other animals , and is controlled by the environment , litter quality and origin , and the identity and abundance of microbes and other decomposers . However , it is not well understood how animals and climate interact to control the rate of decomposition . For example , it has been suggested that larger animals , such as arthropods , are more likely to decompose than smaller animals , such as microbes . However , little is known about how animals and climate interact to control the rate of decomposition in arid environments .

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in humans .

Pancreatic cancer is also caused by a protein called KRAS , which is found on the surface of many different types of cancer cells , including those in the pancreas .

The human immune system is able to detect and respond to viruses , bacteria and other pathogens . However , the immune system is not able to detect and respond to retroviruses , which are viruses that have been passed on from one generation to the next . These retroviruses are known as endogenous retroviruses , or HERVs for short , and are found in many different species , including humans . However , it is not clear whether these retroviruses are active in humans , or if they have spread to other species , such as monkeys .

Wound infections are a major public health problem . They can lead to delayed or failed healing of wounds , which can cause significant morbidity and adverse economic impacts . One of the most common bacterial infections in wounds is Enterococcus faecalis , which is often found in persistent non-healing wounds . However , it is not well understood how faecalis infection affects wound healing . To address this issue , Chen et al . used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to study over 23 , 000 cells from infected and uninfected wounds in mice .

Plants have evolved to defend themselves against herbivores , such as insects and rodents , and to protect themselves from other threats , such as drought and disease . However , it is not clear exactly how these defenses are activated . One way that plants respond to herbivores is by releasing chemicals called plant volatiles , which can increase the plant’s resistance to future herbivore attacks . However , it is not clear exactly how these chemicals are produced , or how they are transmitted between plants .

The human voice is one of the most complex forms of speech in the world . It is made up of many different sounds , each of which has its own unique structure . For example , a male orangutan can make a long call , which consists of a series of sounds that are repeated over and over again . The orangutan’s long calls can be arranged in such a way that they can be repeated over and over again . However , there are no known examples of vocal sequences in nonhuman primates that are arranged in such a way that they can be repeated over and over again .

When a virus infects an animal , the immune system responds by producing a protein called interferon , which helps the animal to fight off the infection . However , some viruses are able to evade the immune system . For example , a type of virus called 5’-polyphosphate-RNA ( or 5’-ppp-RNA for short ) is able to evade the immune system by producing a protein called MDA5 . The MDA5 protein is found in many vertebrates , including fish , birds and mammals .

Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men . It is also the second most common type of cancer in women , and is associated with an increased risk of heart disease , stroke , and cancer of the prostate gland . The treatment for prostate cancer , called androgen deprivation therapy ( or ADT , for short ) , has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in men .

Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the modern world . It is caused by the failure of the heart’s main pumping chamber , the left ventricle , to pump enough blood around the body . Patients with heart failure often experience sudden episodes of ventricular arrhythmias , which can lead to death . Previous studies have shown that a protein called RyR2 is overactive in the left ventricle , which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias . However , it was not clear whether RyR2 inhibition could prevent ventricular arrhythmias or prevent heart failure .

Many animals , including humans , are able to grow to a size that allows them to survive and reproduce . However , some animals , such as fruit flies , are unable to grow to their full size . This is because they lack a protein called SMA-3 , which helps to regulate the production of collagen , the building block of skin . This protein is produced by a group of proteins called SMA-3/Smads , which work together to regulate the production of collagen .

The immune system is designed to recognize and destroy foreign invaders , such as bacteria and viruses . However , if the immune system is unable to recognize and destroy cancer cells , the cancer may spread to other parts of the body . This is known as “immune evasion” , and it can lead to cancer cells becoming resistant to treatments , such as checkpoint immunotherapy . Checkpoint immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses a molecule called PD-L1 to block the immune system from recognizing and destroying cancer cells .

Livestock disease is a major threat to the world’s livestock industry , which is responsible for over half of the world’s food supply . In addition , livestock reproductive losses , including spontaneous abortions , are a major concern for the livestock industry worldwide , resulting in significant economic loss and posing a threat to public health . However , there is little data on the causes and impacts of livestock reproductive losses , and it is difficult to identify the pathogens that cause these losses .

In the intestine , cells called intestinal stem cells ( or ISCs for short ) are found at the bottom of the intestine . ISCs are thought to be the origin of precancerous adenomas , a type of tumor that develops in the small intestine . However , it is not clear how ISCs are able to grow and form tumors . One possibility is that ISCs are able to differentiate into other types of cells , such as intestinal epithelial cells , which are found at the top of the intestine .

Proteins are made up of a series of molecules called amino acids , which are then packaged together to form a molecule called a polypeptide . To make a polypeptide , a protein needs to be broken down into its constituent amino acids . Proteins can be broken down into their constituent amino acids by a process called aggregation . The process involves a protein called Hsp70 , which helps to break down proteins into their constituent amino acids .

Knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) is the most common form of arthritis in the United States , affecting more than 50 million people . The condition is caused by damage to the cartilage in the knee , which can lead to pain , swelling , and loss of mobility . To diagnose and treat knee OA , doctors use a technique called visual observation , which measures the amount of force that is applied to the knee . However , this technique relies on a person’s ability to walk , which is subjective and dependent on their expertise .

Pain after surgery is one of the most common causes of disability and disability worldwide . It can be caused by a number of factors , including trauma , infection , and inflammation . Pain relief is often difficult to achieve , and opioids are often used to treat pain . However , there is an urgent need to develop non-opioid therapies for pain relief . A human amniotic membrane product called Clarix Flo has been shown to reduce pain after surgery in mice .

Age-related macular degeneration ( or AMD for short ) is the leading cause of blindness in the United States . It is caused by damage to the retina , the light-sensitive layer of cells in the back of the eye , which is responsible for vision . The retina is made up of a layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) , which is made up of brown-pigmented cells . RPE is a layer of cells paved by hexagonal , brown-pigmented cells , which locate between the neural retina and the choroid .

The marmoset is one of the most well-studied animals in the world . It is also one of the most social animals , and is often used as a model system to study social behavior . However , traditional research methods often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors . To address this gap , we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling , a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets .

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) and fetal alcohol syndrome ( FASS ) are disorders caused by excessive alcohol consumption during pregnancy . The symptoms of FASD and FASS are similar to those of schizophrenia , but they are caused by differences in the way genes are regulated in the developing brain and liver . Previous studies have shown that alcohol can disrupt the activity of genes in the developing brain and liver . However , it is not clear how this happens , and how much of an effect it has on the development of the brain and liver . To address this question , Chen et al .

RNA interference ( or RNAi for short ) is the process by which molecules of messenger RNA ( or mRNA for short ) are copied to make molecules of messenger RNA ( or dsRNA for short ) . These dsRNAs are then used as templates to make short interfering RNAs ( or siRNAs for short ) , which can then be used to silence a gene . In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , a gene called bli-1 encodes a protein called unc-22 .

Antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system , and are used to detect and characterize proteins in the body . However , it is not clear how many antibodies are available for a given protein , and how they perform . To address this issue , a group of researchers , funders , and commercial antibody manufacturers have set up a new initiative to test 614 commercially available antibodies against 65 human proteins . The researchers used parental and knockout cell lines to test the performance of the 614 antibodies .

The genome of a living organism contains a large number of genes , each of which encodes a specific protein . However , it is difficult to study how these genes are expressed in a living organism . To do so , researchers need to manipulate these genes in a way that is specific to the tissue in which the gene is expressed . To do this , they need to use a technique called gene silencing , which involves inserting a gene into a specific region of the genome . To do this , researchers need to insert a gene into a specific region of the genome .

Neurons communicate with each other via a network of connections known as synapses . These connections are made up of proteins called synaptic vesicles , which carry information from one neuron to the next , and a protein called neurexin-3 , which binds to the synaptic vesicles . The neurexin-3 protein binds to the synaptic vesicles , and the neurexin-3 protein binds to the synaptic vesicles .

Genes are made up of molecules called messenger RNAs , which contain instructions to make proteins . When a gene is copied , it is translated into a protein called a messenger RNA ( mRNA ) , which is then translated into a protein called a transcription factor ( TF ) . TFs can either move the mRNA to the cell’s nucleus , where it can be translated into a protein , or to the cytoplasm , where it can be translated into a protein .

The roots of a plant are made up of cells called stem cells , which are responsible for the formation of the plant’s tissues . However , as the plant grows , the stem cells are exposed to harmful microbes , which can damage the plant’s tissues . The root cap , which surrounds the stem cells , is thought to protect the stem cells from harmful microbes . However , the root cap itself does not grow in size . Instead , the stem cells are shed as a cell package , followed by a process called programmed cell death ( or PCD ) .

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the brain . It is caused by a protein called amyloid beta , which accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease . Accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain is thought to contribute to the loss of synapses , the connections between nerve cells , which are essential for communication between neurons . However , it is not clear how amyloid beta causes synapses to lose their integrity .

The human body is made up of many different types of cells , each with its own unique set of genes . One of these is the immune system , which protects the body from infection by bacteria and other microbes . However , the immune system is also vulnerable to infection by other microbes , such as viruses and bacteria , which are known as ‘opportunistic’ pathogens . This means that the immune system is unable to fight off these pathogens , which can lead to serious infections and even death .

The prefrontal cortex is a region of the brain that plays an important role in memory , planning and decision-making . The prefrontal cortex is made up of a network of neurons called the prefrontal cortex , which are connected to each other by a network of neurons known as the NMDA network . NMDA neurons communicate with each other by releasing a chemical called NMDA into the synapse , which is then translated into a chemical called GABA . However , NMDA neurons are not always able to communicate with each other at the same time , and this is thought to contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia .

Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed in the body . This process relies on the formation of new blood vessels by a group of cells called endothelial cells , which are found in the interior of the blood vessels . These cells are able to differentiate into two different types of endothelial cells , known as Tip cells and Stalk cells . Tip cells are found at the leading edge of the developing blood vessel , while Stalk cells are found at the leading edge of the developing blood vessel .
