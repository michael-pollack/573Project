These bacteria are able to evolve resistance to existing drugs because they have mutations that allow them to adapt to new environments . This means that , if a new drug becomes available , the bacteria will be able to resist it . However , it is not clear how these mutations affect the fitness of the bacteria . One way to answer this question is to look at the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria in the laboratory . To do this , researchers use a technique called evolutionary genetics to track the evolution of bacteria in the laboratory . This allows them

The brain processes information in two ways: first , it encodes the information in a form called working memory , which is stored in the brain’s cortex . Second , it processes the information in a form called working memory history , which is stored in the hippocampus , the part of the brain that processes memories of past experiences . The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is important for learning and memory , but it is not well understood how the brain processes working memory history . To address this question , Chen et al . have now developed a computational model of the working memory that

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women with a 5-year survival rate of only 22% . Immune checkpoint inhibitors ( or ICIs for short ) are a class of drugs that block the immune system from recognizing and attacking cancer cells . However , ICIs have failed in most patients with lung cancer , and it is not clear how they can be improved . One possibility is that ICIs can be combined with other therapies , such as chemotherapy , to improve the effectiveness of ICIs . However , it is not clear how ICIs

The mRNAs are then used to make proteins , which are then released into the cell . However , it is not clear how the mRNAs are translated into proteins , and how these proteins interact with the mRNAs . One way to understand how mRNAs are translated into proteins is to look at how the mRNAs are translated into proteins . To do this , researchers first need to understand how the mRNAs are translated into proteins . To do this ,

The roots of a plant are made up of many different types of cells , including stem cells and epidermal cells , which are responsible for the formation of the plant’s tissues and organs . However , many of these stem cells die during the plant’s development , leading to the formation of the plant’s tissues and organs . This process is known as developmental programmed cell death ( or dPCD for short ) . However , it is not clear how this process works , and how it is regulated to ensure that the plant’s tissues and organs are protected from harmful microbes .

Neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease , are caused by the accumulation of proteins and other molecules in the brain . The accumulation of proteins and other molecules in the brain is known as aggregate transfer , and it is thought that aggregates can spread from one neuron to another . However , it is not clear how aggregates can spread from one neuron to another . One way that aggregates can spread is through the production of large vesicles , which contain proteins and other molecules . These vesicles are made up of proteins and other molecules , and they are transported by

Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia in the United States . The disease is caused by a buildup of toxic proteins called amyloid plaques in the brain . These plaques are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease , but it is not clear how the plaques cause the disease . Previous studies have shown that a protein called Wnt plays an important role in the formation of amyloid plaques . However , it was not clear how Wnt plays a role in the formation of amyloid plaques in the brains of healthy people . Now , Li et al . show that

Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria , fungi and viruses . However , these drugs are becoming increasingly ineffective , and the number of bacteria that are resistant to them has increased dramatically . This has led to the emergence of new antibiotic-resistant bacteria , and the need to develop new antibiotics that are more sustainable . One way to find new antibiotics is to search for natural compounds that are produced by bacteria . These compounds are known as siderophores , and they can be produced by bacteria that live in the environment . However , it is not clear whether these sider

Schizophrenia is a brain disorder that affects the ability of the brain to process information . The disorder is caused by a loss of connections between neurons in the prefrontal cortex , a region of the brain that is involved in decision-making . The loss of connections between neurons in the prefrontal cortex is thought to contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia . However , it is not clear how the loss of connections between neurons in the prefrontal cortex causes the disorder . One possibility is that the loss of connections between neurons in the prefrontal cortex is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein called NMDAR . NM

Angiogenesis is a process that involves the formation of new blood vessels from existing blood vessels . It is a complex process that involves many different types of cells , including endothelial cells , which line blood vessels , and stem cells , which are the precursors of many other cell types . However , it is not clear exactly how these different types of cells form new blood vessels . One possibility is that the endothelial cells that form new blood vessels from existing blood vessels are able to differentiate into different types of cells . This process is known as ‘morphogenesis’ . However , it is not clear how

The hippocampus is a region of the brain involved in learning and memory . The hippocampus contains a large number of neurons , many of which are involved in learning and memory . However , it is not well understood how these neurons communicate with each other , and which neurotransmitters , such as dopamine , are important for the formation of memories . One possibility is that neurons in the hippocampus release a chemical called norepinephrine into the hippocampus . However , it is not clear whether this chemical is also important for the formation of memories . Another possibility is that neurons in the hippocampus release a chemical called dopamine
