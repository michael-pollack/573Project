0,"Gene expression varies widely between individuals of a population , and regulatory change can underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical relevance . A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .
Naturally occurring genetic differences in gene regulation within populations underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical interest [1]–[3] and can serve as the basis for inference of regulatory networks [4] , [5] . A key problem in the field is understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DNA sequence variants give rise to expression change . Recent work has emphasized the importance of sequence differences in regions upstream of gene loci that harbor cis-acting determinants of transcription factor binding [6]–[10] and chromatin architecture [11]–[13] . Much less is known about the role of 3′-end regulation as a determinant of expression variation between individuals . Alternative polyadenylation represents a major regulatory strategy in the human genome , with analysis across tissue types detecting multiple 3′ UTR forms of over half of all human genes [14] . Detailed genetic studies have implicated polymorphisms affecting transcript termination in both Mendelian and complex human disease [15]–[20] . Genomic analyses have hinted at a broader role for genetic differences in RNA 3′-end processing as a driver of expression variation [6] , [8] , [21] , [22] , but the prevalence and the mechanisms of these changes are incompletely understood . Progress in dissecting the genetics of 3′-end processing has been limited in part by fundamental questions about the regulatory information encoded in 3′ UTRs . Single-gene studies have made clear that , in addition to its interplay with exonic splicing [23] , [24] , RNA 3′-end processing can dictate the extent of 3′ UTR sequence incorporated into mature transcripts that governs half-life , translation , and localization [25]–[29]; the efficiency of transcription termination itself can also influence steady-state expression level of a given length form [30]–[34] . In general , however , identifying the regulatory elements that underlie relationships between 3′ UTR sequence and gene expression remains a primary challenge , and for the majority of human genes , the regulatory impact of alternative polyadenylation is unknown . Likewise , the search for molecular players underlying cis-regulation of 3′-end processing at individual gene loci [23] and genome-scale regulation of 3′-end processing in trans [14] , [29] , [35]–[40] is an area of active research . A complete understanding of the genetics of alternative polyadenylation will require maps of transcript end site usage and 3′ cis-regulatory elements , and analysis strategies to integrate the data . Recently developed short-read sequencing methods for transcript ends [40]–[46] have enabled the possibility of quantitative studies of the regulatory architecture of transcript end forms on a genomic scale . In this work , we set out to investigate mechanisms by which alternative polyadenylation impacts gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals . We used 3′-end RNA-seq [42] to maximize the genomic coverage and precision of transcript end positions , and to measure quantitative expression levels of transcript forms . The results shed light on the architecture of transcript ends and regulatory elements in human 3′ UTRs and the principles of genetic variation in 3′ length form usage .
To survey the 3′ ends of transcripts in human B-lymphoblastoid cells , we isolated RNA from cell lines derived from six human individuals and subjected each replicate of each sample to 3′-end RNA-seq , which sequences polyadenylated transcript ends on a genomic scale [42] with strong and significant reproducibility ( Figure S1 ) . Our analysis pipeline , described in Materials and Methods , filtered out likely products of mispriming from A-rich genomic regions [47] and categorized mapping reads in terms of well-defined peaks or dispersed regions of reads with no peak structure ( Table S1 ) . We considered the former to represent the strongest candidates for stable , functional transcript end forms , and focused on these for in-depth analysis , taking the last mapped base of each read as the likely site at which the nascent RNA was cleaved from the processing polymerase and polyadenylated [24] . Across such transcript ends mapping to nuclear-encoded loci , the vast majority of reads ( 87% ) originated from 3′ UTRs of coding genes ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) ; 80% of transcript ends were consistent with the 3′ ends of previously annotated length forms ( Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S2 ) . Within 40 base pairs of the inferred cleavage position , most transcript end forms harbored a polyadenylation signal sequence: either the canonical A ( A/U ) UAAA [23] or a close variant , or an A-rich stretch [48]–[50] ( Figure S3A ) . Reporter assays confirmed the regulatory importance of A-rich stretches upstream of the inferred cleavage positions in CPSF1 and WDR18 , whose 3′ UTRs lacked canonical polyadenylation signal motifs ( Figure S3C ) . We set out to analyze our data set of 3′ transcript ends with respect to alternative polyadenylation , focusing on a maximum of two abundant , distinguishable transcript forms in a given gene . We considered three patterns of transcript end usage [30]: class I , indicating genes with a single transcript form terminating in an annotated 3′ UTR; class II , genes with alternative polyadenylation in the same annotated 3′ UTR; and class III , genes in which the two alternative polyadenylation forms differed in their composition of coding sequence ( Figure 1B ) . We also observed a small fraction of genes with a single transcript form terminating inside annotated coding exons or introns ( Table S3 ) . The breakdown of transcript forms into these classes revealed alternative polyadenylation reaching our threshold of detection in ∼30% of genes ( Figure 1B ) . Across these genes , we observed the expected enrichment of the A ( A/U ) UAAA polyadenylation signal motif in the distal relative to proximal polyadenylation signals ( Figure S3A ) , correlating with the higher expression levels of the long transcript forms [30] , [51] . The lower-abundance short transcript forms were more likely to harbor an A-rich stretch or no recognizable polyadenylation signal motif upstream of the inferred cleavage position ( Figure S3B ) , lending credence to the notion that the latter regions represent weak recognition sites for the 3′-end processing machinery [48] . We sought to harness our data set of transcript ends to investigate regulatory elements governing translation and transcript half-life , and their relationship to alternative 3′ transcript forms . For this purpose , we applied a motif-search strategy to identify putative microRNA binding sites , A/U rich elements ( AREs ) , G/U-rich elements , binding sites for the Pumilio family of proteins , and Alu transposable elements in 3′ UTRs . We tabulated rates of sequence variation across human populations and observed marked conservation of most regulatory element motifs relative to the background level of 3′ UTR polymorphism ( Figure 2A ) , reflecting a history of purifying selection on these putatively functional regulatory sequences [52]–[54] . We expected that the regulatory logic of alternative polyadenylation would be intimately connected with sequence determinants of transcript half-life or translation in 3′ UTRs . For a given gene subject to alternative polyadenylation , we referred to the region of the 3′ UTR upstream of the proximal cleavage site as “shared” among the alternative polyadenylation length forms , and the span of the 3′ UTR in between the proximal and distal cleavage sites as the “differential” region ( Figure 2B ) . We hypothesized that , if alternative polyadenylation often acted to tune the exposure of cis-regulatory motifs in 3′ UTR sequences , these motifs would preferentially be positioned in differential regions . To test this , we tabulated the positions of each type of regulatory element across our set of alternatively polyadenylated genes in class II . Significance testing revealed a significant enrichment of genes with motifs in the differential regions of 3′ UTRs relative to those with motifs in shared regions ( Figure 2C ) . Analyzing the annotations of genes in these sets , we observed a preponderance of genes with immune-related functions among those with cis-regulatory motifs in the differential regions of 3′ UTRs , while motifs in shared regions of 3′ UTRs were largely detected among genes with housekeeping roles ( Table S5 ) . Thus , for genes carrying out immune processes in B-lymphoblastoid cells , the choice between long and short transcript end forms often exposes or eliminates regulatory information in 3′ UTRs , highlighting the importance of 3′-end processing in the control of gene expression levels for specialized cell functions . To investigate the genetics of RNA 3′-end processing , we first assessed the contribution of genetic differences , relative to experimental and environmental error , to variation of transcript 3′-end positions across the six genotypes of lymphoblastoid cells in our study . For this purpose , we calculated the heritability of length form abundance for each gene , finding 194 coding genes at which the abundances of transcript length forms differed reproducibly ( heritability>0 . 6 ) across human samples ( Table S6 ) . To begin to dissect the molecular basis for natural genetic variation in 3′-end usage at these loci , we considered the potential role for DNA sequence differences at polyadenylation signals , the primary determinants of transcript cleavage and polyadenylation . We reasoned that although such variants were rare in the human population ( Figure 2A ) , some could underlie differences between human individuals in 3′-end length form usage . Consistent with this prediction , genes with highly heritable transcript end positions harbored a single nucleotide polymorphism in polyadenylation signal motif sequence much more often than did the average gene ( 2% of polyadenylation signals at genes with heritable transcript ends , compared to 0 . 3% genome-wide; Fisher's exact p = 0 . 004; Table S6 ) . We hypothesized that naturally occurring genetic variation in RNA 3′-end processing would prove to underlie changes across individuals in steady-state levels of gene expression . To test this , we analyzed the genomic relationship between biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and gene expression differences across our set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from distinct human genotypes . We used a standard regression test of genetic association to evaluate genotype at each such sequence variant as a predictor of expression of the gene in which it lay . The results revealed a significant enrichment of association with expression for variants in polyadenylation signals , relative to the background signal from 3′ UTRs as a whole ( Figure 3A ) . We expected that for a given such variant , the allele conferring a closer match to the canonical polyadenylation signal motif would confer more robust transcription termination , and thus more abundant steady-state levels of transcription , than would the allele weakening the match to the canonical motif . To quantify this effect , we scored each allele in each variant polyadenylation signal with respect to agreement with the canonical motif , and at each variant position , we calculated the difference in scores between alleles . This score difference was a strong predictor of the effect of a given polyadenylation signal variant on steady-state expression levels ( Figure 3B ) , with a departure from the polyadenylation signal motif associated with a drop in expression as predicted . To pursue on a molecular basis the impact of variation across humans in polyadenylation signals , we used our 3′-end RNA-seq data to infer the effects of single-nucleotide variants on usage of 3′ transcript forms at individual genes , and we evaluated these predictions in single-gene 3′ UTR reporter assays . For each gene , toggling natural variant alleles at one nucleotide position in the polyadenylation signal was sufficient to drive differential usage of short and long 3′ transcript forms ( Figure 4 ) . These included variants attenuating usage of 3′ forms of the translation initiation factor EIF2A and the putative DNA methylation enzyme DIP2B , as well as the expected effect of the polymorphic polyadenylation signal on usage of 3′ forms of the inflammation regulator IRF5 [15] . In each of the latter genes , the causal variant conferred significant changes in luciferase protein levels as well as usage of transcript forms ( Figure 4A–F ) . Our set of confirmed causal variants at polyadenylation signals also included that in the transcription factor NAB1 , which attenuated usage of a minor 3′ transcript form with modest effect on luciferase levels ( Figure 4G , H ) . We conclude that sequence differences in polyadenylation signals represent a key mechanism underlying variation between humans in levels of gene expression , with genome-scale trends validated at the single-gene level . We next sought to dissect the mechanisms by which natural variation in 3′-end usage impacted gene expression , using as case studies IRF5 and DIP2B , which lie in genomic regions associated with susceptibility to lupus [15] and colorectal cancer [55] , respectively , as well as NAB1 and EIF2A . In RNA expression measurements using the 3′ UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms of a given gene , one form was detected at higher abundance in each case ( Figure 4B , D , F , H ) . We hypothesized that these abundance differences between length forms could be in part the result of sequence elements that dictate transcript cleavage , polyadenylation , and termination , and in part the result of regulatory elements that affect transcript half-life . To test this , for each gene we first developed expression reporters incorporating only the regions flanking the end positions of each transcript form in turn , which we expected would include the polyadenylation signal and auxiliary sequence motifs underlying 3′-end processing of the respective form while excluding most other 3′ regulatory information . Expression measurements confirmed differences in the strength of these 3′-end processing motifs between length forms for EIF2A , IRF5 , and DIP2B , in that reporters incorporating each of the two 3′-end sequences from a given gene exhibited up to 2 . 5-fold differences in expression ( Figure 5A , C , E ) . To assess the contribution of 3′ regulatory elements that control transcript half-life , we next measured the decay rate of each transcript length form upon addition of actinomycin D in the context of complete 3′ UTRs . Measurements of transcript stability by quantitative PCR and by Northern blot bore out this prediction , with the long transcript form showing reduced half-life relative to the short form for IRF5 [15] and DIP2B ( Figure 5D , F and Figure S4B , C ) , and increased half-life for NAB1 ( Figure 5H and Figure S4D ) . Analyzing these results together with the effects of natural variants in polyadenylation signals ( Figure 4 ) indicates that for a given gene , a variant can abrogate production of a transcript form with strong sequence determinants of 3′-end processing , leaving only the less efficiently processed form and giving rise to lower total expression of the gene product , as in IRF5 and EIF2A . In addition , a variant abrogating production of a transcript form with longer half-life leaves only the less-stable form and reduces total steady-state levels of the gene product , as in IRF5 and DIP2B . As a further investigation of the determinants of abundance of long and short transcript forms for genes subject to natural genetic change in 3′-end processing , we analyzed the role of 3′ regulatory elements in such genes in relation to trans-acting regulatory factors . We identified a candidate ARE in the differential region of the 3′ UTR of IRF5 , i . e . between the positions of alternative 3′ ends observed in our 3′-end RNA-seq; a candidate ARE in the differential region of NAB1; and a candidate binding site for the miRNA miR-101 in the differential region of DIP2B ( Figure 6 ) . To assess the functional relevance of these motifs , we applied a mutagenesis strategy using 3′ UTR reporter constructs for each gene , as above distinguishing between the 3′ UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms and the haplotype producing only the long form ( Figure 4D , F , H ) . For each inferred cis-regulatory element , we assayed the regulatory response of 3′ UTR reporters to the trans-acting factor predicted to mediate its repressive effect: the ARE-binding proteins TTP and AUF1 for IRF5 and NAB1 , respectively , and a mimic of miR-101 for DIP2B . In each case , expression measurements from mutagenized reporter constructs established the respective sequence element as necessary for full repression of the long form of its host UTR ( Figure 6 ) , validating our motif inferences . Among experiments that used haplotypes producing both short and long 3′ forms of the respective UTRs , motifs in the differential region were only necessary for repression by trans-acting factors in the case of NAB1 ( Figure 6C ) , for which the population of transcripts arising from this haplotype was dominated by the long form ( Figure 4H ) . Taken together , our results illustrate the complexity of regulatory information in 3′ UTRs , as determinants of RNA 3′-end processing and transcript fate each contribute to the final expression level of the host gene . We conclude that , for these case studies , integrating predicted regulatory motifs with knowledge of transcript end positions is essential in the effort to relate genotype to gene expression . We next aimed to shed light on the biological context in which differences in regulatory responsiveness could manifest between long and short transcript forms . For this purpose , we focused on natural variation in alternative polyadenylation at the immune regulator IRF5 . In response to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , immune genes undergo an immediate spike in expression , followed by dampening to a more modest steady-state level mediated by the ARE-binding protein TTP [56]–[58] . Motivated by our discovery of a repressive ARE in the differential region of IRF5 ( Figure 6A ) , we hypothesized that the genetically determined production of long and short 3′ mRNA forms of this gene would be associated with different patterns of regulatory behavior after induction . To test this , we treated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from genetically distinct individuals with LPS and , in each culture , measured the recovery of expression levels of IRF5 transcript forms over time . The results , shown in Figure 7 , revealed , after an initial overshoot in expression , a difference of up to 2-fold in the time to reach steady-state expression between long and short mRNA forms , with the long form downregulated to steady-state more quickly after induction as predicted , given the presence of the repressive ARE in the latter transcript . Variation in IRF5 expression recovery across B-lymphoblastoid lines was associated with genotype at the proximal polyadenylation signal in the IRF5 3′ UTR: haplotypes encoding the long form of IRF5 conferred rapid repression after induction ( Figure 7B ) relative to haplotypes encoding the short form ( Figure 7A ) . These findings suggest that genetic variation in 3′-end processing dictates differences across individuals in the regulatory dynamics of IRF5 , further underscoring the power of our approach to identify biologically relevant regulatory effects of 3′-end processing . Our molecular confirmation of cis-regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs inferred from sequence search methods ( Figure 6 ) suggested that such inference could provide a mechanistic understanding of gene expression on a genomic scale . In particular , we expected that sequence variants between individuals in 3′ regulatory elements would be significant predictors of variation in steady-state expression of the genes in which they lay . To test this notion , we first tabulated all single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the cell lines of our data set which overlapped with 3′ regulatory motifs and Alu elements in 3′ UTRs . We next classified these motifs according to the impact of alternative polyadenylation on their positions in 3′ UTRs , and we used association tests to assess the strength of each motif variant in each class as a predictor of steady-state expression of its respective gene . The results ( Figure 8 ) revealed association with expression across human individuals , for variants in AREs , G/U-rich elements , Pumilio sites , and Alu elements . The relationship with expression was striking and significant for variants in regions of 3′ UTRs constitutively incorporated into mature messages ( Figure 8 ) . Polymorphic motifs incorporated into low-abundance 3′ length forms showed no evidence of association with expression changes in their respective genes , consistent with the minor contribution of these forms; by the same token , polymorphic motifs in regions incorporated into the predominant 3′ length forms of mRNAs were more strongly associated with expression of their respective genes , though not significantly so ( Figure 8 ) . As expected [6] , the relationship between sequence variants and gene expression did not manifest for miRNA sites ( data not shown ) . These findings highlight the relevance of 3′ regulatory motifs as predictors of expression variation across human individuals , when integrated with knowledge of transcript length forms from our sequencing strategy .
Alternative polyadenylation is prevalent in the human transcriptome , and in landmark cases , variation across individuals in the use of 3′ length forms of RNAs has been shown to underlie human disease [15]–[20] . However , for most human genes , the regulatory importance of changes in transcript ends between individuals is incompletely understood , owing to the challenges of measuring 3′-end usage and identifying functional regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs . We have developed a spatially precise , quantitative , high-throughput sequencing approach for 3′ ends , complementing now-classic studies of expressed sequence tags [30] , [36] , [48] , [51] , [59]–[61] . We have used the resulting transcript end positions and abundances to pioneer an analysis approach which integrates bioinformatic predictions of 3′ regulatory motifs , genomic analysis , and molecular genetics . With this strategy , we have established a regulatory map of transcript ends and functional elements in the 3′ UTRs of lymphoblastoid cells , and we have abstracted genomic principles of alternative polyadenylation and natural genetic variation in this cell type . Our mapping of 3′-end length forms and sequence motifs in 3′ UTRs revealed an intuitive logic in which the choice between short and long UTR forms governs the incorporation of regulatory elements into mature messages [36] , [61] . We note that the 3′ length forms we report in B-lymphoblastoid cells represent a subset of the total complement of 3′ UTR lengths used across tissues . As such , we hypothesize that surveys of tissue types will ultimately reveal transcript forms of many genes , used in particular contexts , that incorporate 3′ regulatory information to different extents . The ability to tune the responsiveness to trans-acting input itself distinguishes alternative polyadenylation from other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms , providing a compelling model for the particular advantage of 3′-end processing as a regulatory strategy and a rationale for its prevalence in mammalian genomes . In comparisons across cell lines from genetically distinct individuals , we analyzed the regulatory importance of genetic changes at 3′ transcript ends . We uncovered a key role for polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals as a driver of changes in gene expression , and we detailed the molecular mechanisms at play . The polyadenylation variants we study here dictate the production of transcript forms with different determinants of 3′-end processing , different half-lives , and different recognition sites for trans-acting regulators . These findings establish a connection between observational studies of transcript 3′ length forms across human populations [21] , [22] and regulatory effects of this variation . In the case of IRF5 , we discovered that a naturally occurring genetic change in usage of 3′ RNA forms can serve to tune the kinetics of recovery of expression after induction by lipopolysaccharide . Thus , against the backdrop of prior studies of this lupus susceptibility gene [15] , we have uncovered an additional dimension by which variation in RNA 3′-end processing affects regulatory behavior . Given these case-study results as a validation of our genome-scale analyses , we speculate that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3′-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population . We have also shown that polymorphisms in 3′ motifs that govern transcript fate can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of the genes in which they lie . In light of the ultimate goal of predicting regulatory and phenotypic effects from human genome sequence , our results indicate that analysis strategies using sequence determinants of transcription initiation and splicing alone are likely to provide an incomplete model of expression variation . Importantly , however , our work makes clear that binding sites for regulators of mRNA localization , half-life , and translation at 3′ ends are themselves only part of the regulatory landscape . Rather , a complete understanding of the genetics of gene expression will integrate the usage of RNA 3′-end processing signals with the effects of 3′ sequence elements that control transcript fate . We anticipate that abundances and positions of transcript ends observed in 3′-end RNA-seq will prove to be a key component in the systems-level modeling of regulatory networks and their variation . In summary , while the genetic study of RNA 3′-end processing is in its infancy , our work and that of others [15]–[22] establishes that variation at 3′ ends can be a critical determinant of regulatory behaviors . However , for the vast majority of human genes , the importance of 3′ regulatory change remains unknown . Our single-gene experiments detail the expression effects of 3′ UTR variation in the disease-associated genes IRF5 [15] and DIP2B [55]; the potential for regulatory variants as drivers of human disease will serve as continued motivation for genomic and genetic analyses of expression change .
Two biological replicates of each of the human lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , GM17189 , GM17207 , GM17220 , and GM17253 ( Coriell Institute ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamate and 15% fetal bovine serum . Cells were incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide . Total RNA was extracted from ∼107 cells using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and genomic DNA was removed from RNA using Turbo DNase ( Ambion ) . Polyadenylated RNA was selected from 10 µg of total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit ( Invitrogen ) , and was fragmented for 3 minutes at 70°C using 10× Fragmentation Reagent ( Ambion ) . After ethanol precipitation , polyadenylated RNA fragments were selected using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II ( Invitrogen ) and anchored oligo-dT ( Invitrogen ) . Double-stranded cDNA was generated using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) and DNA Pol I ( Invitrogen ) , end-repaired using T4 DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , Klenow DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , and T4 PNK ( New England Biolabs ) , and then adenylated using Klenow 3′ to 5′ exo minus ( New England Biolabs ) . Illumina paired-end adapters were ligated to the adenylated cDNA using T4 DNA Ligase ( Enzymatics ) . Ligated cDNA was purified on a 2% agarose gel and then amplified by performing 12 cycles of PCR using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Libraries were sequenced using 40 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer . Consecutive T's from the beginning of all reads were trimmed and classified before mapping: for a given read , if there were more than 20 consecutive T's or if neither mate of a read pair had a stretch of T's , the read was not included in further analysis . For mapping , the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) segregating in the CEU population was downloaded from HapMap phase II+III , release 27 ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/hapmap/genotypes ) , and used to modify the human reference genome ( hg18; [62] ) by incorporating the appropriate ambiguous bases at each SNP position . All reads were then mapped to this modified genome and to the associated splicing junctions in the Known Genes database of the UCSC genome browser [63] using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . For a given length of trimmed T's , nT , a splicing junction reference was created by concatenating 37 - nT bp from each exon adjacent to the splicing junction to ensure that the reads mapped across the splicing junction . If the reads mapped to both the genome and a splicing junction , the mapping with smaller number of mismatches was used . Only uniquely mapped reads with two or fewer mismatches in each mate were retained . Trimmed T's were then compared to the genome sequence; reads with >2 mismatches to the genome in this poly-T tract were retained for analysis . We inferred that a given read was transcribed from the minus strand of the genome if , when it was mapped to the reference genome , the position of its poly-T tract had a lower coordinate position than the mapped position of the other end of the read; we inferred that a read was transcribed from the plus strand of the genome if the mapped position of its poly-T tract had a higher coordinate position than the position of the other end . Mapped reads yielded an average coverage of 22 . 6% of UCSC annotated 3′ UTRs with a depth of 97 . 8 reads/bp for the covered bases for each sample . The last 100 bp of annotated 3′ UTRs were even more highly represented in libraries , with an average coverage of 43 . 4% and an average depth of 211 . 1 reads/bp . Mapped reads from all samples were pooled , sorted according to the polyA positions , defined as the coordinate of the base adjacent to the polyA tail , and then grouped into tag clusters as follows . For each strand of each chromosome , the 5′ boundary of a tag cluster was set as the polyA position of the first read , and then reads were sequentially added to this unit until the polyA position of the next read was more than 15 bp away . The latter position then became the 5′ boundary of the next tag cluster . Most tag clusters spanned less than 24 bp , but if the polyA positions in a cluster spanned more than 40 bp , we applied a peak-finding algorithm as follows . For each genome coordinate in the region corresponding to the tag cluster , we defined the read count as the number of reads whose polyA position overlapped the coordinate . From these we first identified the genome coordinate ( posM ) with the greatest read count ( MaxHeight ) . We then delineated a window 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream of this coordinate . Within this window , we retained all coordinates with read counts greater than 10% of MaxHeight . Of these , we identified the most 5′ and 3′ polyA positions ( posL and posR ) . All reads in the tag cluster were then divided into three new candidate tag clusters: reads with positions 5′ to posL , reads with positions including and between posL and posR , and reads with positions 3′ to posR . If the distance between posL and posR was longer than 40 bp , the middle candidate tag cluster was eliminated from further analysis . If the read counts of all coordinates in a candidate tag cluster were below 10% of MaxHeight , the candidate unit was eliminated . If a candidate tag cluster contained coordinates with read counts larger than 10% of MaxHeight , we identified the coordinate with the largest read count within this candidate tag cluster and repeated the peak-finding algorithm . For each tag cluster retained for analysis , we defined the polyA position of the unit as the median of the polyA positions of all reads encompassed by the unit . After establishing that the stretch of A's in each read represented a mismatch to the genome sequence ( see above ) , we filtered out reads with a potential origin from internal priming from A-rich regions of the genome by removing any tag cluster whose defined polyA position was followed by 10 or more A's in the genome sequence within 20 bp . We also filtered out reads with a potential origin as PCR clones or false mapping as follows . We expected that for a given set of paired-end reads falling into a tag cluster , the characteristics of read ends originating from biological 3′-end processing should be distinct from the characteristics of read ends originating from fragmentation , reverse transcription , and ligation during RNA-seq library preparation . In particular , we reasoned that the polyA positions of a set of reads in a tag cluster with origin as a biologically relevant transcript would be less heterogeneous than the positions of the other mates of the reads . If the opposite were true , we considered the tag cluster to be a likely product of false mapping or PCR duplication . As such , we retained a tag cluster for analysis only if the precision of polyA positions across the reads of the unit was greater than the precision of the positions of the other mates . The precision was calculated by where ni is the number of reads at the ith position and N is the total number of reads in the tag cluster . We also filtered out any tag cluster whose total read count across all samples amounted to fewer than 50 reads . For tag clusters with read counts between 50 and 100 , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between each pair of the two biological replicates across the six cell line samples , and eliminated the tag cluster from further analysis if the absolute value of R was less than 0 . 5 . For use in searches for regulatory motifs , we harnessed all 3′-end RNA-seq reads in tag clusters from all samples to define a consensus base at each position in 3′ UTRs as follows . At every genomic coordinate covered by five or more 3′-end RNA-seq reads , the consensus nucleotide was chosen as that with highest frequency across the sample . If the second most abundant base was more than 20% in abundance , it was incorporated into the consensus using an ambiguous base notation ( M = A or C , R = A or G , W = A or T , S = C or G , Y = C or T , K = G or T ) . For every tag cluster , the consensus sequence of the region 40 bp upstream from the polyA position was searched for a polyadenylation signal using the known hexamer motifs sorted by their abundance in the human genome from [30] . Polyadenylation signals with higher abundance were given higher priority when there was more than one instance in the 40 bp upstream window . In the absence of a match to these motifs , the 40 bp upstream window was searched for an A-rich stretch as follows . We identified any 9 bp regions containing at least 6 A's and considered each such region a candidate polyadenylation signal; if no such candidate signal were present , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable polyadenylation signal . If more than one candidate signal was present , we retained the one with the most A's . For each boundary of this region , if the boundary nucleotide was an A , the region was extended to include all consecutive A's . If the first base was not an A , it was trimmed until the first base was an A . To find upstream U-rich elements ( USE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate USE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 30 bp upstream of the polyadenylation signal . If there were fewer than six T's or if the candidate did not have three consecutive T's , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable USE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window wasextended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 65%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . To find downstream U/G-rich elements ( DSE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate DSE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 40 bp downstream of the poly-A position . If there were fewer than five T's or if the window did not contain at least one of the strings TTT , TGTG , GTGT , GTCT , CTGT , TCTG , or TGTC , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable DSE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window was extended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 50%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . Human gene annotations were downloaded from the Known Genes database of the UCSC Genome Browser [63] . Among the UCSC transcript annotations that overlapped the start and end positions of a tag cluster , the annotation with the minimum distance between the annotated 3′-end position and the polyA position of the tag cluster was chosen . If there were multiple annotations with the same 3′-end positions , we chose the annotation with greatest degree of overlap between the tag cluster consensus sequence and the annotated exons . The genomic coordinates of human expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) with polyA tails were downloaded from the polyA_db2 database [64] . The genomic coordinates were converted from hg17 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . If the coordinate of polyA_db2 EST was between the start and end position of a tag cluster , we considered the length form corresponding to the unit to be supported by the EST . All tag clusters with the same UCSC gene annotation were categorized as associated with the gene , and only the two tag clusters with the highest expression per gene were used for classification of alternative polyadenylation . We classified each gene as follows: class I if there was only one tag cluster overlapping with the annotated 3′ UTR of the gene; class II if both tag clusters overlapped with the annotated 3′ UTR of the gene and they were associated with the same UCSC transcript ID; class III if one of the tag clusters overlapped witha coding exon or intron , or if both tag clusters overlapped with 3′ UTRs with different UCSC transcript IDs . We calculated the broad-sense heritability in polyA positions using biological replicates of 3′-end RNA-seq across the six human cell lines as follows . For a given gene , we considered the polyA position of the most abundant tag cluster in each replicate of each sample as a quantitative trait , and calculated the heritability H2 of this trait from intraclass correlations [66] given by the following equations . Here , indices i and j refer to sample and replicate , respectively; is the polyA position for sample i , replicate j; is the average between two replicates for sample i; is the average of all samples and replicates; MSe is the error mean square ( within-individual ) and MSb is the between-individual mean square . Heritability of total expression levels for each gene was calculated analogously , using as a quantitative trait the sum of read counts across the gene normalized by the sum of all reads . To identify microRNA binding sites in 3′ UTRs , the Perl script from TargetScan Release 5 . 2 [67] was used to predict miRNA binding sites in the 3′ UTR sequences of all expressed genes . miRNA sequences and families were downloaded from the TargetScan database . Only predicted binding sites with context scores less than −0 . 4 were used for analysis . To identify AU-rich elements , the class II motif WWWT ( ATTTA ) TTTW was searched in the 3′ UTR sequences of all expressed genes allowing up to one mismatch outside the central pentamer , ATTTA . Overlapping motifs were combined . To identify GU-rich destabilizing elements , the motif TGTTTGTTTGT was searched in 3′ UTR sequences allowing up to one mismatch . To identify Pumilio binding elements , the motif TGTANATA was searched in 3′ UTR sequences . Alu transposable element motifs were taken from RepeatMasker ( www . repeatmasker . org ) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser . We note that each search strategy used human sequence data alone rather than inter- or intra-species conservation to identify motifs . SNPs within the human population were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project database [68] . Genomic coordinates were converted from hg19 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . For each regulatory element motif , the SNP rate was calculated as the total number of SNPs within all motif matches divided by the sum of the lengths of all matches . For the background model of sequence variation in 3′ UTRs used in Table S4 , we first tabulated all instances of A , C , T , and G across all positions of 3′ UTR sequences in the hg18 human reference genome , where the boundaries of 3′-ends were taken from our compendium of 3′-end RNA-seq data for genes expressed in our samples . We refer to these frequencies as P ( A ) , P ( C ) , P ( T ) , and P ( G ) , respectively . We then tabulated the SNP rate separately for each of these four sets of base positions from the 1000 Genomes data set , which we refer to as P ( SNP , A ) , P ( SNP , C ) , P ( SNP , T ) , and P ( SNP , G ) , respectively . We used these values to calculate the expected density of polymorphisms for the stretch of genome corresponding to a given 3′ motif match as: where is the sequence of bases of length Ns corresponding to the motif match in the human reference genome and P ( SNP|si ) is the probability of a single-nucleotide polymorphism for the nucleotide si at position i , calculated as: For each regulatory motif , P ( SNP|s ) was calculated for every instance of a motif match across all 3′ UTRs in the reference genomefor genes expressed in our samples , and the lower and upper bounds listed in Table S4 were taken as the minimum and maximum values of this distribution , respectively . For miRNA binding sites , only the 7-mer seed sequence was used . The DEFOG web-based tool ( http://www . mooneygroup . org/defog ) was used for Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis in Table S5 as follows . For each type of regulatory element analyzed in Figure 2C , we tabulated a list of class II genes with motifs in the shared region only , and combined these lists across elements . For each Gene Ontology term , we then evaluated the significance of the representation of genes annotated in the term in this list , relative to a background set of class II genes harboring at least one motif , using DEFOG with default parameters . Separately , we tabulated an analogous combined list of class II genes with motifs in the differential region only and repeated the DEFOG analysis . To find polymorphisms in 3′ UTRs across the six individuals of our sample , we generated mRNA-seq libraries [69] from one biological replicate of each cell line sample , and sequenced using 36 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer , resulting in 21 to 24 million reads per sample . The sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome ( hg18 ) using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . Mapped reads ( 10 to 14 million per sample ) yielded an average coverage of 48% of UCSC annotated exons with an average depth of 27 reads/base for the covered bases . Mapped reads were used to call SNPs using GigaBayes ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) with options –ploidy diploid –O 3 –indel –CAL 10 . Only SNPs with a quality score higher than 0 . 99 were retained for analysis . This set of SNPs was used in association tests with total gene expression levels as follows . Given tag cluster definitions for each gene from analysis of 3′-end RNA-seq libraries ( see above ) , we calculated a normalized expression level for each tag cluster in each sample as the ratio between the number of 3′-end RNA-seq reads mapping within the tag cluster boundaries in the sample and the total number of mapped 3′-end RNA-seq reads in the sample . We then defined the expression level of a given gene in a given sample as the sum of all normalized expression levels across all tag clusters in that gene . To get a final estimate of gene expression level for use in association tests in Figure 3 and Figure 8 , we summed expression values across the two replicate samples from each cell line . For each SNP in the 3′ UTR of a gene , we identified the major allele across all cell lines and scored each diploid genotype in terms of the number of major alleles ( values ranging from 0 to 2 ) . Given the complete matrix of gene expression levels and genotypes across all six cell lines , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between allele counts and the started logarithm of the gene expression level . For Figure 3A and Figure 8 , we used the absolute value of R as the association statistic , and for Figure 3B , we used the signed value of R . In cases of alternative polyadenylation , SNPs in polyadenylation signals upstream of a maximum of two major length forms were considered for association tests . To analyze the effect of genetic variation in polyadenylation signal strength on expression in Figure 3B , each allele of each polyadenylation signal was assigned a score: 1 if the signal was AATAAA or ATTAAA , 0 . 5 if the signal was a match to the “variant” polyadenylation motifs in [30] , and 0 otherwise . The polyadenylation signal strength difference was calculated by subtracting the strength of the minor allele from the major allele . In Figure 3A , we analyzed SNPs in 3′ UTRs for 4214 genes and SNPs in polyadenylation signals for 33 genes . In Figure 8 , we analyzed regulatory element SNPs in 62 , 16 , 7 , and 20 genes respectively in 3′ UTRs of class I genes , shared regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes , differential regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes whose long forms were more abundant , and differential regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes whose short forms were more abundant . A psiCheck-2 vector ( Promega ) was modified to generate a 3′ UTR reporter vector , pOKY001 ( Figure S5 and Table S8 ) , in which we removed the SV40 late polyA signal from the firefly luciferase gene and replaced it with a tag for ligation independent cloning ( LIC ) [70] of 3′ UTR sequences of interest . Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines using the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit ( Epicentre ) , and 3′ UTR sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) with PCR primers with LIC tags . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 using LIC , and plasmids were purified using Plasmid Midi Kit ( Qiagen ) . Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed using QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . All primers used for PCR and mutagenesis are listed in Table S7 . Cloned sequences of all reporter vectors were checked by capillary sequencing . The list of reporter vectors is provided in Table S8 . HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids in six-well culture plates . For each of two independent transfections for each construct , at 90% confluency , 1 µg of plasmid DNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . After incubating at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for 24 h , the cells were washed with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) , detached from plates by adding 300 µL of trypsin-EDTA and incubated at 37 degrees for 5 minutes . After adding 900 µL of media , the detached cells were split into three 2 mL tubes , and pelleted by spinning at 1000× g for 3 minutes . The cell pellets were washed with DPBS and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C . Given one cell pellet from each of two reporter transfections ( see above ) , cells from each pellet were lysed and used for two technical replicates of a dual luciferase assay using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) . Luminescence from the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially in a Turner BioSystems Veritas Luminometer . The ratio of luminescence measurements between Firefly and Renilla luciferases was used for all analyses . To measure expression of short and long forms for a given gene with alternative polyadenylation , we considered quantitative PCR assays that would interrogate regions just upstream of the inferred cleavage sites of the short and long forms ( which we refer to below as SU and LU , respectively ) . We reasoned that expression measurements of SU would reflect abundance of both the short and long transcript forms , whereas LU would reflect abundance of the long form only . For a given transcript in a given experiment , the absolute mRNA level ( calculated from quantitative PCR reactions on a biological sample and standards , as described below ) from the primer set amplifying LU was used as the expression level for the long form; the expression level of the short form was calculated by subtracting the absolute mRNA level of LU from the absolute mRNA level of SU for all genes except IRF5 . Primer sequences for IRF5 were taken from [15] , where the primer set for SU hybridized to the polyA tail and only amplified the short form . Thus , for IRF5 , the mRNA count from SU was used as the expression level for the short form . All other primers were designed using Primer3 Plus [71] , checked for potential hairpins and primer dimers using BeaconDesigner Web Edition ( PREMIER Biosoft International ) . Primers were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals . For each transcript in each experiment , measurements were normalized by absolute mRNA counts of Renilla luciferase or GAPDH genes . All primer sequences are in Table S7 . Expression measurements on cells transfected with 3′ UTR reporters were performed as follows . Given one cell pellet from each of two transfections ( see above ) , total RNA was isolated from each pellet separately using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . For each sample , genomic DNA was removed from 10 µg of total RNA using TurboDNase ( Ambion ) . Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of DNased RNA using oligo ( dT ) ( Invitrogen ) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) , and then RNA was removed using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) . For each of two technical replicates for each primer set and sample , the cDNA was amplified using the DyNamo HS SYBR Green QPCR Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) for 40 cycles on a Strategene MX3000P qPCR instrument . We calculated absolute numbers of mRNA molecules amplified from each primer set in each experiment by comparing the number of amplification cycles taken to reach a given threshold against a standard curve constructed using samples of a synthetic template ( gBlocks Gene Fragments , Integrated DNA Technologies ) of known absolute numbers of molecules , in serial dilutions extending from 107 to 101 molecules . Reporters incorporating 3′ processing signals were constructed as follows . For each length form of each gene , we aimed to clone a region centered on the cleavage site as inferred from the transcript end position observed in 3′-end RNA-seq , bounded by the 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream in the genomic sequences and flanked by LIC tags ( region sequences for EIF2A , IRF5 , DIP2B , and NAB1 were taken from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms for cell lines GM17220 , GM10860 , GM10860 , and GM17220 respectively ) . This 115-bp construct was produced by PCR stitching two opposite-strand DNA oligos of 60 bp and 78 bp ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) with 23 bp overlap using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) for 3 cycles . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 and purified as described above . Transfection and dual luciferase assay were performed as above . For each transcript half-life measurement , cells transfected with a luciferase reporter harboring the complete 3′ UTR from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms of a given gene were incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for ∼24 h . A stock solution of actinomycin D dissolved in DMSO was added to achieve a final actinomycin D concentration in tissue culture media of 10 µg/mL . After incubation times as indicated in Figure 5 and Figure S4 , cells were harvested for quantitative PCR measurements as above or Northern blotting as described below . To generate expression vectors for ARE-binding proteins , the tristetraprolin ( gene name ZFP36 ) coding sequence was amplified from the vector pGFP-TTP and the AUF1 p37 coding sequence from pCDEF-His-AUF1-p37 ( both kind gifts from B . Glaunsinger ) . Each gene was cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector ( Invitrogen ) . Syn-has-miR-101 , a miRNA mimic of has-miR-101 , was purchased from Qiagen ( MSY0000099 ) . For dose-response assays , expression vectors or miRNA mimic were mixed with the corresponding luciferase reporter vectors ( Figure 6 ) and then transfected as above . Lipopolysaccharide from E . coli K12 ( Invivogen ) was added to each of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , and , GM17207 to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL in 6-well tissue culture plates , and incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide . The cells were harvested after 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 16 hours by centrifuging at 1000× g for 3 minutes , washing with DPBS , and then flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen . RNA was isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) . The DIG Northern Starter Kit ( Roche ) was used for Northern blotting . A 400 bp region of firefly luciferase gene was amplified from luciferase reporter vector pOKY001 , and cloned into pcDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) . A digoxigenin ( DIG ) labeled RNA probe for firefly luciferase was created by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase after linearizing the plasmid with BamHI . Total RNA isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) was cleaned using RNeasy columns ( Qiagen ) with on-column DNase-digestion . Between 1 and 10 µg of total RNA was loaded and run on 1% denaturing agarose gels . The gels were stained with SYBR Gold ( Invitrogen ) and then the separated RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes ( Roche ) and UV cross-linked . Both the gels and the membranes were imaged on Blue Light Transilluminator ( Invitrogen ) to check the transfer of SYBR-stained RNA . 28S ribosomal RNA bands on the membranes were used as the loading control in Figure S4 . Each membrane was subjected to prehybridization , probe hybridization , low and high stringency washing , and detection procedures recommended by the manufacturer ( Roche ) . Anti-digoxigenin-AP ( Roche ) and CDP-Star ( Roche ) were used for chemiluminescent detection of the DIG-labeled RNA probe . To maximize length resolution for EIF2A , total RNA was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with RNaseH ( Invitrogen ) and an oligo antisense to a 20 bp region upstream of the binding site for the Northern probe in the firefly gene . For DIP2B , the denaturing agarose gel was treated with 0 . 05% NaOH and washed with water before blotting onto the nylon membrane . The expression data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) ( http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/geo ) database ( series accession number GSE33154 ) .","Messenger RNAs carry the instructions necessary to synthesize proteins that do work for the cell . Extending beyond the protein-coding sequence of a given mRNA is an additional stretch of sequence , harboring signals that govern how much protein is made and how long the mRNA remains in the cell before it is broken down . The incorporation of this end region into mature mRNA is itself subject to change; for the vast majority of human genes , how and why cells use different mRNA ends remains largely unknown . In this work , we surveyed mRNA ends from ∼10 , 000 genes in immune cells from genetically distinct human individuals . We found that mRNA end positions were not randomly distributed , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate . The usage of these mRNA length forms and regulatory elements varied across individuals and could be dissected molecularly . Our results uncover key mechanisms and regulatory effects of transcript end processing , particularly as these are perturbed by genetic differences between humans .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Materials' 'and'

1,"The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .
Two decades ago , a report described a cohort of rhesus macaques infected with the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) , SIVΔnef , and subsequently protected from pathogenic wild-type SIV challenge [1] . Since then , numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SIVΔnef-induced protection , ranging from complete protection with sterilizing immunity to partial protection with two or more logs reduction in peak and set-point viremia [2–6] . Remarkably , presumably in part due to the replication of SIVΔnef in mucosal sites [7] , robust protection has been also been documented following mucosal challenges [3–5] . SIVΔnef has also induced significant protection against heterologous challenge , albeit less effectively than against homologous challenge [4 , 5] . However , studies describing disease progression in SIVΔnef-vaccinated infant macaques and a subset of adult non-human primates precluded live attenuated HIV from being developed as a vaccine in human subjects [8–10] . Due to concerns over safety , research on SIVΔnef and related LASIV vaccines has shifted from safety-and-efficacy determination to mechanism-of-action delineation . As the most effective lentiviral vaccine , SIVΔnef has been extensively studied in order to shed light on the correlates of vaccine-mediated protection . However , no immunological correlate or mode of action has consistently been identified as being responsible for protection against pathogenic challenge . SIVΔnef generates a diverse SIV-specific antibody response [11 , 12] and macaques vaccinated with the related attenuated virus SIVΔ3 and lacking the Mamu-A*01 MHC I allele show effective control of pathogenic viral challenge despite CD8 T cell depletion [13] , implying that humoral immunity may play a significant role , at least in some genotypic backgrounds . Innate immunity has also been implicated as a correlate of SIVΔnef-induced protection [3] . SIVΔnef infection induces potent CD8 T cell responses similar in magnitude to wild-type SIV infection [14] , and multiple studies have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the protection induced by SIVΔnef [4–6 , 15] . Most recently , Fukazawa et al . [6] correlated the magnitude of lymph node SIV-specific T cell responses with protection elicited by a range of different LASIV strains , including SIVΔnef . Finally , studies in a related vaccine challenge model involving vaccination with an attenuated SHIV strain have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in the female reproductive tract as playing a crucial role in protection [16] . In this work , we sought to scrutinize the interplay of the attenuated virus and the immune response at a high resolution . We chose to focus on the CD8 T cell response as the most likely immune correlate for protection given that previous studies have demonstrated: potent anti-lentiviral activity of CD8 T cells in vitro [17–21]; increased viremia during chronic SIV infection after CD8 T cell depletion [22]; the ability of a live attenuated SHIV vaccine containing HIV env to protect vaccinated macaques against SIVmac239 challenge [16 , 23]; SIVΔnef-mediated protection of animals challenged with wild-type SIVmac239 containing highly heterologous env sequences [24]; and a correlation between increased LASIV-induced protection and higher magnitude of SIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes of vaccinated animals [6] . A distinguishing feature of the SIVΔnef and SIVΔ3 vaccines is the gradual increase in protection against wild-type SIV challenge during the first 15–20 weeks of vaccination [2 , 25] . Given the low-level replication rate of SIVΔnef after initial control of viremia by 8–12 weeks after vaccination , it was unknown whether SIVΔnef undergoes sequence evolution after acute infection . The only previously documented sequence evolution of SIVΔnef was in the Tat SL8 epitope , which escaped as early as 3 weeks post-infection [26] . We hypothesized that , despite low levels of viral replication , SIVΔnef undergoes sequence evolution during the vaccination period , which would induce a shift in the specificity of the CD8 T cell response between week 5 , when the animals are not protected , and week 20 , where increased protection plateaus [12] . We made use of high-throughput deep sequencing to quantify SIVΔnef sequence variants and their frequencies in vaccinated animals , including those with undetectable plasma viral loads . Concurrently , we fine-mapped the CD8 T cell responses at the epitope level at week 5 and 20 post-vaccination . Studying this cohort of animals longitudinally after SIVΔnef vaccination , we demonstrate concomitant coevolution of the virus and the specificity of the CD8 T cell response , resulting in a CD8 T cell repertoire with increased anentropic specificity , wider cumulative breadth , rearranged immunodominance and enhanced depth .
The animals included in this study were all female Indian-origin rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) , housed in a biocontainment facility at the New England Primate Research Center ( NEPRC ) . These experiments and procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals . At approval of the study , the assigned protocol number by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) was 04383 . The Harvard Medical School animal management program is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care , International ( AAALAC ) , and meets National Institutes of Health standards as set forth in the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [27] . The institution also accepts as mandatory the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions and NIH Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing , Research , and Training . There is on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare ( OLAW ) an approved Assurance of Compliance ( A3431-01 ) . All animals were housed indoors in an SOP-driven , AAALAC-accredited facility . Husbandry and care met the guidance of the Animal Welfare Regulations , OLAW reporting and the standards set forth in The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All research animals were enrolled in the NEPRC behavioral management program , including an IACUC-approved plan for Environmental Enrichment for research primates . This program included regular behavioral assessments , and provision of species appropriate manipulanda , and foraging opportunities . This protocol had an IACUC-approved exemption from social housing based on scientific justification . Primary enclosures consisted of stainless steel primate caging provided by a commercial vendor . Animal body weights and cage dimensions were regularly monitored . Overall dimensions of primary enclosures ( floor area and height ) met the specifications of The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and the Animal Welfare Regulations ( AWR's ) . Further , all primary enclosures were sanitized every 14 days at a minimum , in compliance with AWRs . Secondary enclosures ( room level ) met specifications of The Guide with respect to temperature , humidity , lighting and noise level . The animals were provided ad lib access to municipal source water , offered commercial monkey chow twice daily , and offered fresh produce a minimum of three times weekly . Light cycle was controlled at 12/12 hours daily . The animals were subject to twice daily documented observations by trained animal care and veterinary staff , and enrolled in the facility's environmental enrichment , and preventative health care programs . Euthanasia took place at defined experimental endpoints using protocols consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) guidelines . Animals were first sedated with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride at 20 mg/kg body followed by sodium pentobarbital ( ≥100 mg/kg ) intravenously to achieve euthanasia . To determine SIV protein-specific T cell responses , 9 whole protein peptide pools were constructed containing 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 μg/ml for each . Peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome and corresponding to the peptide sequences available from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH , were synthesized by the Massachusetts General Hospital core peptide facility . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . For epitope mapping , a three-dimensional peptide matrix was constructed . The matrix was composed of 87 peptide pools , each containing around 27 to 30 peptides . The 87 peptide pools encompassed the entire SIV proteome with a coverage of 3-fold , such that each of the 823 overlapping peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome was represented in 3 different pools . The peptides used for epitope mapping were 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . The entropy for each epitope within SIVmac239 was determined by calculating the entropy of each 9-amino-acid window within SIVmac239 , which was determined by aligning 10 proteomes of SIVsmm , the ancestral virus of both the clonal SIVmac239 and the quasi-species SIVmac251 . The aligned proteome sequences were then uploaded into the Shannon Entropy-One calculator from the Los Alamos National Database ( http://www . hiv . lanl . gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one . html ) . The program calculates an entropy score for each 9 amino acid sequence in the SIVsmm proteome . In order to detect only IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells , ELISPOT assays were carried out with PBMCs or lymph node mononuclear cells ( LNMC ) after negative selection of CD4 T-lymphocyte populations fractionated by magnetic bead separation ( CD4 Dynabeads; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) as previously described [20] . Negatively selected CD4 T cells were >90% CD8 T cells . CD4 T cell-depleted PBMC and LNMC were suspended in R-10 medium and used the same day in ELISPOT assays . Isolated lymph node CD4 T cells were pelleted and used for RNA extraction and cell-associated viral RNA quantitation and sequencing . For quantitation of plasma viral loads in SIVΔnef-infected animals , highly specific , real-time RT-PCR assays were performed as described previously [28] . The assay specific for SIVmac239Δnef was developed by designing a reverse primer that uniquely recognizes the sequence generated by the deletion of nef coding sequences in SIVmac239 . The nominal threshold for this assay was 30 viral RNA copy equivalents/ml plasma . To sequence lymph node cell-associated viral RNA , cell-associated viral loads were first determined , incorporating qPCR assay primers and probes for SIV gag , rhesus CCR5 and SIVmac239Δnef as described [28] . Briefly , pelleted cells were rapidly disrupted in 100 μl lysis/digestion solution ( 3M GuHCl , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml Proteinase K ) , utilizing a Branson 450 sonifier equipped with a high-intensity cup horn and set at 60% power amplitude ( Branson Ultrasonics , Danbury , CT ) . After continued digestion at 42°C for 1 hour , 400 μl of GuSCN/carrier solution ( ~5 . 7 M GuSCN , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM EDTA , 600 μg/ml glycogen ) was added to completely dissociate RNA-protein complexes . Total nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 500 μl isopropanol , collected by centrifugation , and washed with 70% ethanol . This precipitate was air-dried , suspended in 60 μl 1X TurboDNAse buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) , and split into 2 equal 30 μl aliquots for separate RNA and DNA preparation . The samples for DNA determinations were denatured by heating to 100°C for 5 min and quenched on ice prior to qPCR . Associated with determinations of SIVmac239Δnef DNA , cell equivalents based on qPCR for rhesus CCR5 at single haploid copy per genome ( 2 copy equivalents per cell ) were determined on aliquots diluted 1:10 with 5 mM TrisCl , pH 9 . 0 . Copy equivalents of SIVgag and SIVmac239Δnef targets were determined as described [28] . For the aliquots reserved for RNA , 20 μl of a cocktail containing 2 μl ( 4 Units ) TurboDNAseI in 1X buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) were added to each , and the samples incubated at 42°C for 30 min to digest DNA . After digestion , RNA was recovered by addition of 200 μl of GuSCN solution without glycogen carrier , followed by precipitation with 250 μl isopropanol and a 70% ethanol wash , as noted above . Genome equivalents based on SIV gag or SIVmac239Δnef target sequences were determined as described . The threshold limits of detection for both SIV DNA and SIV RNA were 30 total copies of SIV sequence normalized to calculated cell equivalents . Plasma samples were spun at 14 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 1 hour in a microcentrifuge . Viral RNA was then isolated using the Qiamp MinElute Virus spin kit according to manufacturer’s instructions . Plasma viral RNA and cell-associated viral RNA ( isolated and quantitated as described above ) were reverse transcribed and amplified using 4 sets of primers to produce 4 overlapping amplicons spanning the entire length of the viral coding sequence using the SuperScript III High Fidelity One-Step RT-PCR kit ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . PCR products were either purified with the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction ( Qiagen ) kit or Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) . Samples were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) The four resultant amplicons were combined and then libraries were created and tagged using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Individually tagged libraries were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) and the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . Libraries were then pooled together , denatured with NaOH , and run on an Illumina MiSeq using either a 300 or 500 cycle MiSeq Kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . IFN-γ-producing T-cell responses were enumerated using an enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay for detection of macaque IFN-γ ( Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . CD4-depleted PBMC and LN mononuclear cells were stimulated at 2x105 cells per well with peptide pools ( 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 μg/ml each ) . Cells were incubated overnight in multiscreen plates ( Millipore ) coated with an IFN-γ capture antibody , and spots representing IFN-γ-producing T cells were detected in an enzyme-linked , colorimetric assay for bound IFN-γ . Spots were counted using an automated ELISPOT plate reader ( Zellnet Consulting , New York , NY ) . For epitope mapping , peptide-pool-stimulated wells , containing a number of spots 3 times higher than background and greater than 30 spots per million mononuclear cells , were selected for second round deconvolution . To deconvolute peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses , peripheral and lymph node mononuclear cells , depleted of CD4 T cells , were stimulated with single peptides that were present in at least 2 positive pools of the 87 peptide pools . Wells with responses to single peptides 3 times higher than background and greater than 60 spots per million were considered significant . Comprehensive MHC I typing using pyrosequencing was conducted as described [29] . Total cellular RNAs were converted to cDNA using a Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen ) . Primary cDNA-PCR amplicons spanning 190 bp of exon two of macaque class I sequences were generated with high-fidelity Phusion polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Each PCR primer contained one of 12 distinct 10 bp MID tags along with adaptor sequences for 454 pyrosequencing . After purification , primary amplicons were normalized to equimolar concentrations and groups of 12 animals were pooled for GS FLX analysis . The emulsion PCR and pyrosequencing steps were performed with Genome Sequencer FLX instruments ( Roche/454 Life Sciences ) using GS FLX protocols according to the manufacturer’s specifications ( 454 Life Sciences ) at the 454 Sequencing Center ( Branford , CT ) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign High-Throughput Sequencing Center . Surface staining was carried out by standard procedures for our laboratory as described [30] . Except where noted , all reagents were obtained from BD Biosciences ( San Diego , CA ) and included monoclonal antibodies to the following molecules: CD3 ( clone SP34-2 , APC-Cy7 conjugate ) CD4 ( clone SK3 , PerCP-Cy5 . 5 conjugate ) , CD8α ( clone RPA-T8 , Alexa700 conjugate ) , CD28 ( clone CD28 . 2 , PE-Texas Red conjugate , Beckman-Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) , CCR7 ( clone 150503 , Pacific Blue conjugate , custom ) , KI-67 ( clone EH12 . 2H7 , PE conjugate , custom ) , CD127 ( clone R34 . 34 , PE conjugate , Beckman-Coulter ) , perforin ( clone Pf-344 , FITC conjugate , Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . Intracellular staining for perforin and KI-67 expression was performed using Caltag Fix & Perm ( Invitrogen , Camarillo , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol . Enumeration of SIV-specific cells using PE- or APC-conjugated tetramers to Mamu-A*01 Gag181–189CM9 and Tat28–35SL8 ( kindly provided by Nancy Wilson and David Watkins , Wisconsin National Primate Research Center , Madison Wisconsin ) was performed as described previously [31] . All acquisitions were made on an LSR II ( BD Biosciences ) and analyses were done using FlowJo software ( Tree Star Inc . , Ashland , OR ) . Isotype-matched controls and/or fluorescence-minus-one ( FMO ) controls were included in all assays [32] . All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software ( GraphPad Software v6 . 0b , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Non-parametric Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis where the sample size was less than 6 . Otherwise , parametric t tests were conducted; p values less than 0 . 05 were assumed to be significant in all analyses .
To study the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response following vaccination with SIVΔnef , we first assessed the extent of viral sequence variation in 12 animals after SIVΔnef infection using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) . The vaccinated animals , most of which displayed classical SIVΔnef viral replication kinetics of peak viremia at week 2 and viral set-points at or near undetectable levels ( <30 copy Eq/ml ) at week 8 , were followed for 20 to 40 weeks before challenge ( Fig . 1A ) . Plasma viral samples from the 12 vaccinated animals were sequenced at time points ranging from 1 week to 34 weeks post-vaccination . RT-PCR was used to create four overlapping amplicons corresponding to the full-length SIV viral genome . Libraries were prepared from the pool of four amplicons and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform . Although there was already widespread sequence variation during the first 2 weeks after vaccination with SIVΔnef , none of the variants in any of the animals sequenced exceeded a threshold of 10% ( Figs . 1C and S1 ) , suggesting that these variants were not subject to significant selection in vivo during this initial observation period . However , by week 4 post-vaccination , as the viral load declined from peak viremia , there was a significant increase in the prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations that exceeded the 10% threshold . At this time point , plasma viral RNA samples from 12 animals displayed an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations , each with a greater frequency than 10% ( Figs . 1C and S2 ) . To determine if sequence variation continued to increase between weeks 4 and 20 , plasma viral RNA was sequenced from the 3 macaques with detectable viremia at week 20 . Plasma viral RNA samples from these 3 animals at week 20 had an average of 28 nonsynonymous mutations with a frequency greater than 10% , a marked increase compared to an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 ( Figs . 1C and S3 ) . To determine the extent of sequence evolution in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals that had lower levels of plasma viremia , we analyzed lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 from 3 animals . Follicular helper CD4 T cells , which are localized in secondary lymphoid tissues , are preferentially infected by SIVΔnef [33] , and therefore have higher cell-associated viral RNA levels than CD4 T cells in peripheral blood [6] . Sequencing of lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 revealed increased viral sequence variation even in SIVΔnef-infected animals with undetectable plasma viremia , albeit at lower levels of variation than observed for viremic animals . Lymph node associated viral RNA sequenced from animals with undetectable plasma viremia had an average of 15 nonsynonymous mutations with a greater frequency than 10% ( Fig . 1D ) , a substantial increase over the 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 for these animals ( S2 Fig . ) . SIVΔnef was longitudinally sequenced in 5 animals , from plasma virus at week 4 and either plasma virus or LN CD4 T cell-associated virus at week 20 . Pooling all the variants ( greater than 10% frequency ) for all 5 animals , the average frequency of nonsynonymous mutations increased from 29% at week 4 to 47% at week 20 ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Moreover , there was a significant accumulation in the number of nonsynonymous mutations , increasing from an average of 10 nonsynonymous mutations per animal at week 4 to an average of 24 at week 20 ( p = 0 . 031 ) ( Fig . 1E ) . In all animals whose virus was sequenced , there was extensive sequence evolution as measured by the number of nonsynonymous mutations and their frequencies , including in animals with undetectable plasma viral loads . To determine if viral sequence evolution was accompanied by a shift in the epitopes targeted by the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response , we analyzed CD8 T cell responses at weeks 5 and 20 in the 12 vaccinated animals using IFN-γ ELISPOT assays using overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire SIV proteome . In contrast to increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , there was a 40% decrease in the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2A ) . Similarly , the breadth of the CD8 T cell response did not correlate with increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , as the number of positive pools remained stable , with an average of 6 stimulating pools detected at week 5 and an average of 5 . 2 pools detected at week 20 in PBMCs ( Fig . 2B ) . A recent report demonstrated that the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes at week 50 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef correlated with protection against intravenous challenge [6] . To determine if the kinetics of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes ( LN ) correlated with the increased protection observed between weeks 5 and 20 , we looked at the magnitude and the breadth of the SIV-specific CD8+ T cell response in lymph nodes . Similar to the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response observed in peripheral blood , the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes decreased modestly , by 25% , between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2C ) . The breadth of the response , as defined by recognition of peptide pools of 30 peptides each , in the lymph nodes was likewise comparable to the breadth of the response in the periphery ( Fig . 2C ) , with a slight decrease from 5 positive pools at week 5 to 4 positive pools at week 20 . We next examined CD8 T cell responses to Gag and Pol , the two most conserved proteins in lentiviruses , as a fraction of total responses to the SIV proteome , an indicator of the level of conservation of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response . Intriguingly , there was a significant enrichment of the ratio of the magnitude of Gag and Pol responses to the total SIV-specific CD8 T cell response between weeks 5 and 20 in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals ( p = <0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . The ratio of Gag and Pol responses to total SIV responses increased in every animal between week 5 and week 20 , increasing from an average of 28% at week 5 to 47% at week 20 . To characterize the shift in CD8 T cell specificity at the level of individual epitopes , we mapped the CD8 T cell response to single peptides for 6 animals at weeks 5 and 20 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef . Epitope mapping of SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses was conducted on CD8 T cells from lymph nodes . For the 2 animals whose SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses were mapped in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood , there was no significant difference in the epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell responses in these two sites ( S1 Table ) . Longitudinal epitope mapping in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals revealed a change in the relative immunodominance of recognized epitopes between weeks 5 and 20 after SIVΔnef vaccination . Furthermore , the specific SIV epitopes recognized by CD8 T cell responses differed significantly between week 5 and week 20 . Of the 36 CD8 T cell epitopes mapped in the 6 animals at week 20 , only 14 were also recognized at week 5 ( Figs . 3A and S4 ) . Almost two thirds of the responses at week 20 are de novo responses or were not readily detectible at week 5 . As a first step in assessing whether these shifts in epitope specificity reflected increased anentropic specificity of the CD8 T cell response , we examined the conservation of targeted epitopes at different times after SIVΔnef vaccination . We assigned every mapped epitope a conservation score by calculating the mean entropy of nine amino acid stretches for all SIV proteins , as determined from the alignment of 10 SIVsmm predicted open reading frames ( Fig . 4 ) . SIVsmm strains were chosen because the virus clone SIVmac239 and the quasispecies SIVmac251 are derived from SIVsmm . Interestingly , in 5 out of 6 animals , the immunodominant response targeted a more conserved epitope ( lower entropy score ) at week 20 than at week 5 ( p = 0 . 039 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . Moreover , 7 of the de novo CD8 T cell responses detected at week 20 targeted highly conserved epitopes with an entropy lower than 0 . 1 . Having established the accumulation of sequence variants between weeks 5 and 20 and a simultaneous shift in the SIV epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response , we sought to determine whether the two events were causally related . Overlaying epitopes mapped onto the sequenced virus from the 6 animals vaccinated with SIVΔnef demonstrated that there was a high concordance between the occurrence of nonsynonymous mutations and identification of CD8 T cell epitopes . In macaque 225–97 , for which we have the most comprehensive set of viral sequence data and longitudinal epitope mapping , almost all of the nonsynonymous mutations ( 7 out of 9 mutations ) with a frequency greater than 50% fell within a mapped CD8 T cell epitope ( Fig . 5A ) , implying a causal link between CD8 T cell pressure and viral escape . Moreover , the nonsynonymous mutations and mapped epitopes not only overlapped spatially but also overlapped temporally . In animals 225–97 and 256–00 , epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses declined in frequency following escape of the epitope ( Fig . 5B ) . Remarkably , escape epitopes in animal 225–97 were themselves overtaken by other epitope variants over time , suggesting CD8 T cell pressure on the escape epitopes as well ( Fig . 5C ) . However , we did not observe sequence variation in all identified CD8 T cell epitopes . As expected , we observed a strong bias favoring the escape of responses targeting highly variable epitopes , as determined by calculated entropy scores . An analysis of the top four responses mapped for each animal at weeks 5 , 20 and 40 after SIVΔnef vaccination demonstrated that the escaped epitopes had significantly higher entropy scores than targeted epitopes that did not escape ( p = 0 . 0013 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . Similarly , SIV-specific CD8 T cells can be grouped into maintained responses , which target mostly conserved regions , and waning responses that target escaped epitopes . The magnitude of the variable responses , defined as targeting epitopes with an entropy above 0 . 25 , decreased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = . 0101 ) and between weeks 5 and 40 ( p = . 0449 ) , whereas the magnitude of the conserved responses was maintained ( Fig . 6B ) . To determine if the selective escape of variable epitopes , coupled with the decline of their CD8 T cell response frequencies , led to an immune response that was increasingly focused on more conserved epitopes , we developed a formula that estimates the conservation level of the immune response . The Response Conservation Index is the sum of all SIV-specific CD8 T cell response frequencies , weighted for entropy . The Response Conservation Index was calculated for every animal at both week 5 and 20 using the formula in Fig . 7 . Importantly , in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were mapped , the Response Conservation Index increased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = 0 . 0156 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . To ascertain that the increased targeting of conserved epitopes in the vaccinated animals was not due to a genetic background enriched for protective MHC I molecules , we conducted comprehensive pyrosequencing of MHC I genotypes in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were longitudinally mapped . The cohort displayed a diverse set of MHC I molecules with three animals expressing the protective alleles Mamu-A*01 and Mamu-B*17 , while the rest of the animals did not express any protective MHC I alleles ( Table 1 ) . Notably , increased anentropic specificity was documented in every animal between weeks 5 and 20 regardless of the MHC I background ( Fig . 7 ) . The number of epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response did not differ between weeks 5 and 20 , as measured by positive peptide pools ( Fig . 2B , 2C ) or the specific mapped epitopes ( Fig . 8A ) . However , we hypothesized that escaped CD8 T cell responses were not deleted but rather maintained as a central memory T cell pool and , therefore , that the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell repertoire , encompassing all previously detected responses in a given animal , may be a more accurate measure of SIV-specific CD8 T cell breadth ( Fig . 8B ) . Phenotypic analysis of SL8-specific CD8 T cells , targeting the highly mutable SL8 epitope , did reveal a shift to a central memory profile between weeks 5 and 20 , characterized by increased cell surface expression of CD28 ( p = 0 . 0087 ) , CCR7 ( p = 0 . 0006 ) and CD127 ( p<0 . 0001 ) , as well as a decrease in intracellular expression of perforin ( p<0 . 0001 ) and Ki67 ( p = 0 . 0194 ) ( Fig . 8C ) . In Mamu-A1*001+ ( previously known as Mamu-A*01 ) animals , SL8-specific CD8 T cell responses are frequently immunodominant during acute infection but quickly decline following the evolution of escape variants , where 82% and 94% of sequenced SL8 epitopes had mutated as early as week 4 in two SIVΔnef-vaccinated macaques ( Fig . 8D ) . Although SL8-specific CD8 T cells reached nearly undetectable levels by week 20 as measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT and SL8-MHC tetramer staining , the responses rebounded in both animals following challenge with SIVmac251 ( Fig . 8D ) . Given the maintenance of responses to escaped epitopes in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , all escaped responses were included in the calculation of cumulative breadth . In contrast to CD8 T cell breadth , the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response increased significantly from an average of 6 responses per animal at week 5 to an average of 10 responses at week 20 ( p = 0 . 0036 ) ( Fig . 8B ) . Finally , SIVΔnef escape , in addition to allowing for anentropic specificity and increased cumulative breadth , contributes to the deepening of the CD8 T cell response . In macaque 256–00 , the mapped Mamu-B17-restricted FW9 ( FHEAVQAVW ) epitope was intact at week 5 but the virus fully escaped by week 20 with 99 . 9% of sequenced reads containing the FW9-H831Y variant . To determine if de novo CD8 T cell responses to the escape variant arose , we tested both variants at week 5 and at the latest time point before challenge , week 38 . Lymph node CD8 T cells from macaque 256–00 recognized FW9 at week 5 but not at week 38; conversely , the FW9-H831Y escape variant was recognized only at week 38 but not at week 5 ( Fig . 9A ) . Similarly , the GY9-K76R epitope variant was recognized at week 38 but not at week 5 demonstrates increased depth of the CD8 T cell response after the escape of the mapped Mamu-A*02-restricted GY9 ( GSENLKSLY ) epitope ( Fig . 9B ) . These data demonstrate that , at least in a subset of SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , the depth of the CD8 T cell response increased between weeks 5 and 20 as new CD8 T cell responses were mounted against escape variants .
Taken together , this data set supports a comprehensive model that provides new insights into the mechanism of SIV-specific immunity maturation after SIVΔnef vaccination . For the first time , we demonstrate that SIVΔnef sequence evolution is widespread after vaccination , not just confined to the previously documented highly mutable epitope of Tat SL8 [26] , and that ongoing sequence evolution occurs even in animals with undetectable plasma viremia . Moreover , we show that the observed sequence evolution can be characterized as viral epitope escape , a consequence of SIV-specific CD8 T cell pressure on the virus as indicated by the many nonsynonymous mutations that appear within mapped CD8 T cell epitopes . Importantly , another direct consequence of immune CTL pressure is the disproportionate escape of highly variable epitopes , which leads to the waning of CD8 T cell responses targeting entropic epitopes and the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses specific for these epitopes . In addition , escaped SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and , as such , contribute to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef . Finally , epitope escape and the ensuing generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to these escape variants constitute a deepening of the CD8 T cell repertoire . Our work sheds new light on SIVΔnef and other LASIV vaccines and how their functional and mechanistic characteristics are fundamentally different from other vaccines . While many of the recent successful replication competent virus vector-based vaccines such as CMV and RRV are also persistent [34–37] , we demonstrate that SIVΔnef is not only a persistent vaccine but that , as a lentivirus , it evolves with the immune response it induces and , ultimately , shapes the CD8 T cell response during the vaccination period . This unique characteristic of SIVΔnef to mutate allows for maturation of CTL specificity through increased targeting of conserved regions , deepening and broadening of the response . Furthermore , this new model accommodates earlier known properties of LASIV , such as the observation that the level of protection of LASIV vaccines inversely correlates with the level of attenuation of the vaccine [6 , 38] . Based on our current work , we hypothesize that LASIV vaccine efficacy depends on virus evolution , resulting in the concurrent CD8 T cell specificity shift from highly variable to conserved regions of the virus . Highly attenuated viruses , such as SIVΔ4 , which exhibits lower efficacy compared to SIVΔnef [38] , would have lower replication rates and less escape events , therefore less opportunity to shape the CD8 T cell response . Despite three decades of HIV research , basic questions of vaccine design remain hotly debated , namely the optimal balance of CD8 T cell response magnitude , breadth and specificity that should be induced by a vaccine . In suggesting that anentropic specificity is a more important correlate of protection in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals than response magnitude , our data corroborates previous work on long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) , another important model of spontaneous lentiviral suppression . Research on LTNP has shown that MHC I molecules associated with protection restrict CD8 T cells that target regions within HIV Gag [39 , 40] as well as highly conserved epitopes [41] . However , unlike viral control in LTNP , which is associated with certain protective HLA molecules , we document increased targeting of highly conserved epitopes in all animals regardless of their MHC I genotypic background . Similar to our LASIV-induced protection , viral control in LTNP is correlated with the immunodominance of CD8 T cell responses that target highly conserved epitopes [42] , given that immunodominant CD8 T cells exert more immune pressure [41] . Finally , studies of LTNP revealed the importance of targeting conserved regions during acute infection [41] , before massive depletion of CD4 T cells has occurred [43] . Our research demonstrates that at week 20 , whereas responses to variable regions have waned , the immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells target more conserved epitopes than at week 5 . The presence of immunodominant CD8 T cells exerting pressure on highly conserved regions during acute infection in animals challenged at week 20 post-vaccination , but not at week 5 , could explain the observed difference in protection . Conversely , the absence of immunodominant responses targeting highly conserved regions in animals challenged at week 5 allows the virus to easily escape and the accumulation of anentropic-specific CD8 T cell responses would occur long after acute infection , if at all . In addition to immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells with anentropic specificity , we also show increased cumulative breadth and depth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 compared to week 5 . The increased cumulative breadth at week 20 is a function of waning escaped CD8 T cell responses that are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and are recalled upon challenge . It is unclear how effective these responses are at long-term viral suppression , given that they have been escaped and mostly target variable regions of the virus . Still , a recent report suggests that acute-phase SIV-specific CD8 T cells targeting variable regions are important for viral control [44] , indicating that the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 may also contribute to protection . Moreover , we detected de novo CD8 T cell responses specific to escaped epitope variants , illustrating that viral escape also contributes to increased immune response depth . Although LTNP generate HIV-specific CD8 T cells that cross-react with escape mutants [45] , the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to escaped epitopes is rarely observed in adults infected with HIV [46] . In animal 256–00 , we identified two such CD8 T cell responses that target variant epitopes at week 38 but were not detectable at week 5 . We only assayed CD8 T cell responses against escape variants of known CD8 T cell epitopes with known MHC I restriction , and only if the MHC I is expressed by the infected animal . The relative frequency of de novo CD8 T cell responses in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , if verified in future studies , could be due to an intact CD4 T cell compartment that persists well into the chronic phase of LASIV infection . Previous reports have documented rapid escape of variable epitopes during acute HIV-1 infection and maintenance of CD8 T cell responses specific for conserved epitopes into chronic infection [47–49] . Here , in the context of SIVΔnef , we demonstrate , in addition to rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of existing CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity , de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection . Furthermore , we correlate the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity and the increased repertoire depth and breadth to the kinetics of SIVΔnef vaccine-induced protection . Previous research on the coevolution of lentiviral epitopes and the CD8 T cell response has been conducted in the setting of wild-type infection , and it is unclear that our findings of increased anentropic specificity , cumulative breadth and repertoire depth during SIVΔnef vaccination would apply to wild-type lentiviral infection , in which the CD8 T cell response is likely to be impaired by the persistently high antigenic load , CD4 T cell depletion in the gut and microbial translocation-induced immune activation . Notably , we did not see an increased magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in the lymph nodes between weeks 5 and 20 . Fukazawa and colleagues [6] have recently shown that less attenuated LASIVs such as SIVΔnef have higher viral replication in the lymph nodes and , in turn , have higher lymph node CD8 T cell responses . Although these results corroborate existing data demonstrating that protection inversely correlates with LASIV attenuation [38] , our data demonstrates that the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response does not correlate with the kinetics of protection , neither in the PBMC nor lymph node compartment . Although our current work supports the importance of conserved responses as a correlate for protection , others have shown that using conserved regions as immunogens may result in a reduction of the total magnitude of responses [50] . It is unknown whether vaccines inducing targeted responses toward conserved regions will make up for the loss of magnitude . Still it is encouraging that we observe increased anentropic specificity in all animals , suggesting that even nonprotective MHC I molecules can target highly conserved epitopes if properly primed . It has also been proposed that the increased protection of LASIV vaccines is due to phenotypic maturation of the CD8 T cell response . It is important to delineate whether observed phenotypic changes in SIV-specific CD8 T cells correlate with LASIV protection and whether CD8 T cell phenotypic maturation is specific to LASIV or can be seen in other vaccines , such as adenovirus- , CMV- and RRV-based SIV vaccines . Finally , although this data set was focused on the CD8 T cell response and its evolution over time post-vaccination , we observed relatively few nonsynonymous mutations in env outside of mapped CD8 T cell epitopes , suggesting that antibody responses induced only modest immune selective pressure on SIVΔnef compared to CD8 T cell responses . Although immunodominance , specificity , breadth and depth have been implicated for some time as determinants of a successful CD8 T cell response against HIV/SIV infection , these results demonstrate how such a CD8 T cell response may be induced by the highly protective SIVΔnef vaccine . This new model of SIVΔnef-mediated protection raises obvious implications for vaccine design , namely that a successful vaccine should focus CD8 T cell responses on conserved regions of the virus and their existing variants . The recent success of viral vectors such as CMV [34–36] , RRV [37] , and adenovirus [51] to elicit potent CD8 T cell responses that partially protect rhesus macaques from infection has been an important step forward in vaccine design . However , these vaccines are all derived from DNA viruses , which have significantly lower rates of mutation than lentiviruses , and thus they are unlikely to shape the immune response in a similar fashion to SIVΔnef . Our work suggests that immunogens should be carefully chosen for these vectors such that the induced responses preferentially target conserved regions of the virus , as well as existing variants of these regions to increase response breadth and depth simultaneously .","Annually , more than two million people are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Materials' 'and' 'Methods' 'Results'

2,"Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , particularly in immunocompromised individuals [1] . Of the diverse forms of disease manifestations , mucosal infections with C . albicans are by far most abundant [2] . The symptoms reach from mild forms of infection to chronic or recurrent diseases . No licensed fungal vaccines are currently available to prevent disease , and toxicity and resistance to available drugs compromise the effective management of patients . With the ever-increasing population of immunocompromised patients , C . albicans infections thus represent an important socio-economic challenge worldwide . The epithelium constitutes the first point of contact between the fungus and the host [3] . It provides an important physical barrier to prevent fungal invasion . Moreover , it has the capacity to sense and respond to the fungus . By producing inflammatory mediators and antifungal defense molecules the epithelium actively participates in the host response and together with leukocytes , including neutrophils and IL-17-producing lymphocytes , contributes to limiting fungal ( over ) growth . Diverse mutual interactions between leukocytes and the epithelium are critical for mounting a broadly protective response against C . albicans . The epithelium elicits signals in response to the fungus that can promote the inflammatory response [3] , while cytokines such as IL-17 , produced by leukocytes , act on the epithelium to enhance its barrier function and antimicrobial activity [4 , 5] . Neutrophils have been shown to rapidly accumulate in the oral mucosa in response to C . albicans infection , and they critically contribute to prevent invasion of the fungus in underlying tissues and dissemination to the circulation and visceral organs as was shown in a model of acute oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) [6 , 7] . The relevance of neutrophils in protection from oropharyngeal candidiasis is also evidenced by the high incidence of the disease in hemato-oncological patients with bone marrow aplasia [8 , 9] . Neutrophils comprise a major proportion of circulating peripheral blood leukocytes . They are generated from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow under the control of granulopoietic growth factors , primarily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) [10] . During acute infection , granulopoiesis is massively enhanced to comply with the increased demand for neutrophils in host defense [11] . Control mechanisms of this demand-adapted hematopoiesis involve long-distance regulatory feedback loops induced at the site of infection where neutrophils act , which is usually distant from the production site of neutrophils in the bone marrow . Increased release of G-CSF in response to infectious and/or inflammatory insult plays a key role in this process [11] . Given the potentially harmful effects of dysregulated neutrophils , granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking is under tight control and regulated in a tissue-specific manner [12] . With the discovery of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and the realization of its critical role in defense against mucocutaneous candidiasis [5 , 13] , it was postulated that IL-17 mediates protection by promoting the neutrophil response . Indeed , IL-17 signaling can enhance expression of neutrophil cytopoietic and chemotactic factors in response to C . albicans [14] . However , we recently demonstrated that neutrophils are recruited normally to the site of infection in IL-17 receptor-deficient mice , thus that the IL-17 pathway is not required for the neutrophil response during OPC [6] . Therefore , although neutrophil trafficking may be regulated by IL-17 in some tissues and in response to certain pathogens [15–19]—this is not the case during C . albicans infection in the oral mucosa . Alternative candidate factors regulating the neutrophil response include IL-1 . In fact , secretion of both IL-1α and IL-1β are efficiently induced in dendritic cells and macrophages when stimulated with C . albicans [20–23] and both IL-1 family members were shown to contribute to protection from systemic infection [24] . Epithelial cells also secrete IL-1 cytokines when triggered with C . albicans [25–27] , although in mice , unlike in humans , keratinocytes produce only IL-1α but no IL-1β [28] . Whether and how IL-1 cytokines contribute to antifungal defense in barrier tissues remains poorly defined . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis , we found that IL-1R signaling is critical for host defense by regulating the neutrophil response . We show here that IL-1 acts by two complementary mechanisms . First , it regulates the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells for the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulating pool to the site of infection . Second , it induces G-CSF production by the endothelium for enhanced neutrophil output from the bone marrow to meet the increased demand in response to infection . Release of IL-1α from keratinocytes upon contact with C . albicans is critical for mediating this crosstalk between the epithelium and the endothelium in the oral mucosa .
Infection of mice with C . albicans via the oropharyngeal route induces a rapid inflammatory response , characterized by a massive recruitment of neutrophils to the oral mucosa ( Fig 1A , S1 Fig ) [6 , 7 , 29] , which accumulate in proximity to where C . albicans hyphae invade the keratinocyte barrier on the dorsal and ventral side of the tongue [6] . Following from our previous findings that neutrophil trafficking during OPC was independent of the IL-17 pathway [6] , we sought after factors responsible for controlling neutrophil recruitment in response to C . albicans . We found that mice lacking the IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) recruited significantly less neutrophils to the site of infection than their wild type ( WT ) counterparts ( Fig 1B ) . In consequence Il1r1-/- mice were unable to control the fungus and displayed an increased fungal load in the tongue on day 3 post-infection ( Fig 1C ) . These data indicated clearly that IL-1R signaling was critical for the neutrophil response during OPC . The rapid accumulation of neutrophils in the oral mucosa of infected mice was paralleled by a strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines CXCL1 , CXCL2 and CXCL5 ( Fig 2A ) . Consistent with the role of IL-1 in neutrophil recruitment , chemokine expression in the oral epithelium was impaired in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 2B ) , while basal levels were comparable ( S2 Fig ) . To determine the cellular compartment responsible for chemokine production , we sorted cellular subsets from the tongue of naïve and C . albicans-infected mice on day 1 post-infection , the peak of the neutrophil response , including CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed chemokine expression at the transcriptional level . The keratinocyte fraction displayed the highest RNA levels , and the induction in response to infection was most prominent in this population ( Fig 2C ) . Consistent with this result , a cell line of tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) also secreted neutrophil-attracting chemokines in an IL-1-dependent manner in vitro ( Fig 2D ) . These data suggested that the neutrophil response to OPC is initiated locally in the infected mucosa . While C . albicans may directly induce chemokine expression in keratinocytes , their production is strongly enhanced by IL-1R signaling . In addition to the strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines during OPC , the expression of Csf3 , the gene coding for G-CSF , was also markedly induced in the infected oral mucosa ( Fig 3A ) , suggesting that it may contribute to the overall neutrophil response during OPC by boosting granulopoiesis and neutrophil egress from the bone marrow . We therefore analyzed typical surrogate hallmarks of emergency granulopoiesis in the bone marrow . While total numbers of CD45+ cells in the bone marrow were unchanged in infected mice compared to naïve controls ( Fig 3B ) , we observed a reduction in mature Ly6Ghi CD11b+ Ly6Cint neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3D ) . This response was paralleled by an increase in Ly6Glo CD11b+ Ly6C- immature neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3E ) . These reciprocal changes in mature and immature neutrophils in the bone marrow indicated that G-CSF , which was induced by the local infection with C . albicans , acted at a distance and thereby elicited a systemic response . Indeed , neutralization of G-CSF impaired the induction of emergency granulopoiesis during infection ( Fig 3F and 3G ) . The increased demand for neutrophils in the infected tissue was thus compensated by an increased rate of granulopoiesis and mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow . The increased neutrophil output from the bone marrow was relevant for the local antifungal response as indicated by the fact that depletion of the circulating neutrophil pool with an anti-Ly6G-specific antibody ( 1A8 ) was not sufficient to blunt the neutrophil response to C . albicans [6] . Instead , the combination of anti-Ly6G and anti-G-CSF was required for efficient depletion of neutrophils in the blood and in the infected tissue ( Fig 3H and 3I ) resulting in a total loss of fungal control ( Fig 3J ) . Note that the reduction of neutrophils by ~1 log ( Fig 3I ) resulted in a ~4-log increase in fungal load over a course of 3 days ( Fig 3J ) , while the ~0 . 5 log reduction in neutrophils in absence of IL-1 signaling ( Fig 1B ) lead to a ~2-log increase in fungal load over the same period of time ( Fig 1C ) . Given the prominent role of G-CSF for the overall neutrophil response during OPC we wanted to understand the regulation of this growth factor in more detail . For this , we isolated again CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes , and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells from the tongue of C . albicans-infected mice and uninfected controls as above ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed Csf3 transcript levels in each population . Surprisingly , the most prominent expression was observed in the endothelial cell population ( Fig 4A ) . Although keratinocytes were previously shown to secrete G-CSF in response to C . albicans in vitro [26] , their contribution in vivo was minor ( Fig 4A ) . Similarly , leukocytes expressed only very low levels of G-CSF during OPC ( Fig 4A ) . To corroborate this unexpected finding , we examined G-CSF protein production by the different cell subsets . Because we were unable to visualize intracellular G-CSF by flow cytometry , we prepared cell lysates from sort-purified tongue cell populations and quantified their G-CSF content by ELISA . Again , by far the highest production of G-CSF was detected in the endothelial cell fraction isolated from infected mice ( Fig 4B ) . Further separation of the CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ population in podoplanin-positive and podoplanin-negative subsets confirmed that blood endothelial cells rather than lymph endothelial cells were responsible for G-CSF production during OPC ( S4 Fig ) . Production of G-CSF by endothelial cells was supported by the observation that high levels of G-CSF could be detected in the serum of infected mice ( Fig 4C ) . Together , these data suggested that G-CSF , which is induced in response to local infection with C . albicans , acts at a distance to promote granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow and thereby sustains a systemic neutrophil response that meets the increased demand of these cells during OPC . Next , we investigated how G-CSF secretion by endothelial cells is regulated during OPC . Direct stimulation of endothelial cells by C . albicans appeared unlikely given their spatial distribution in the oral mucosa . We made use of VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] to visualize the blood and lymphatic vessels in situ and infected them with GFP-expressing C . albicans ( Fig 5A ) . In immunocompetent animals , fungal hyphae were restricted to the avascular tongue epithelium without penetrating the basal epithelial layers . The absence of direct contacts of C . albicans with endothelial cells suggested that G-CSF production was regulated indirectly . Given the important role of IL-1 for the overall neutrophil response to C . albicans , we assessed the IL-1 dependence of G-CSF during OPC . The induction of Csf3 transcripts was less pronounced in the oral mucosa of Il1r1-/- mice ( Fig 5B ) , while basal levels were unchanged ( S2 Fig ) . Likewise , G-CSF protein expression by endothelial cells that were sorted from infected tongues was drastically diminished in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 5C ) . This translated in strongly diminished G-CSF levels in the serum of C . albicans-infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5D ) . In contrast , TNF , which had been proposed to regulate G-CSF expression in vitro [31] , was not involved in G-CSF production during OPC ( S5 Fig ) . As a consequence of the G-CSF defect in Il1r1-/- mice , emergency granulopoiesis was strongly impaired during OPC in these mice , as indicated by the higher ratio of mature to immature neutrophils in the bone marrow of infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5E and 5F ) . Importantly , Il1r1-/- mice responded to G-CSF treatment , and the administration of recombinant G-CSF was sufficient to fully overcome the defect in emergency granulopoiesis in these mice ( Fig 5G and 5H ) . Together , these data demonstrated , that G-CSF secretion during OPC was controlled by the IL-1 pathway . G-CSF production appeared to underlie a different regulatory mechanism compared to neutrophil chemokine production during OPC given their distinct cellular sources , despite the fact that both , chemokines and G-CSF , depended on IL-1R signaling . Next , we examined the expression of IL-1α and IL-1β , the two activating ligands of the IL-1R . Both were found strongly induced during OPC ( Fig 6A ) . IL-1α and IL-1β contribute to G-CSF production during OPC because the induction of G-CSF expression in the oral mucosa and its release into the serum were strongly impaired in absence of IL-1α or IL-1β ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . IL-1β was expressed predominantly by the hematopoietic compartment as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular pro-IL-1β ( S6 Fig ) . To determine the cellular source of IL-1α in the murine tongue , we applied an immunofluorescence approach , which allowed us to detect IL-1α with high specificity on tissue sections . Basal expression levels observed in the keratinized epithelium of the tongue in naïve mice were strongly enhanced upon infection ( Fig 6D ) . Co-staining with antibodies specific for keratinocytes of the tongue ( keratin-6 ) or those of stratum basale ( keratin-14 ) [32] revealed that IL-1α was predominantly produced by differentiated keratinocytes ( Fig 6E ) . Note that the IL-1α signal was absent in neutrophil-rich areas , which were identified by DAPI staining . The availability of preformed IL-1α ( but not IL-1β ) protein in steady-state ( Fig 6D , S6 Fig ) , which can be rapidly released in response to stimulation , together with the strategic position of keratinocytes as the first contact point between the host and the infecting fungus , suggested that keratinocyte-derived IL-1α likely functions as an ‘alarmin’ right at the onset of infection to alert the host about fungal invasion and to initiate a protective antifungal response . As such , keratinocyte-derived IL-1α may also act on endothelial cells and thereby contribute to the neutrophil response during OPC . To delineate the putative crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells in more detail , we made use of a newly generated cell line of mouse tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) ( S7 Fig ) . TDKs expressed high levels of EpCAM and keratin-6 indicating that they represented differentiated oral keratinocytes [32] . Their concurrent expression of keratin-14 was consistent with their origin of basal keratinocytes with stem cell properties . Consistent with published data with keratinocytes from other sources [26] , TDKs released IL-1α when stimulated with C . albicans ( Fig 7A ) . Notably , and in contrast to human keratinocytes [28] , mouse keratinocytes released no IL-1β ( Fig 7B ) . This response was dependent on live and hyphenating fungus because heat-killed or a yeast-locked C . albicans did not induce IL-1α ( Fig 7C ) . Likewise , IL-1α was not induced with zymosan , a yeast cell wall extract , or curdlan , a pure β-glucan preparation ( Fig 7A ) . Consistent with our in vivo data , the overall amount of IL-1α detected from TDKs in response to live C . albicans resulted from the release of preformed cytokine and de novo biosynthesis of IL-1α ( Fig 7D ) . Next , we tested the effect of TDKs and TDK-derived IL-1α on endothelial cells for G-CSF induction ( Fig 8A ) . For this , we employed an established endothelial cell line , MS1 [33] . TDKs and MS1 cells both did not produce G-CSF when directly stimulated with C . albicans nor with curdlan or zymosan , although they responded strongly to LPS , which was included as a positive control ( Fig 8B and 8C ) . However , MS1 cells secreted high amounts of G-CSF when stimulated with the sterile-filtered supernatant of C . albicans-stimulated TDKs ( Fig 8D ) . This response was dose-dependent ( Fig 8E ) and only observed when TDKs were stimulated with life and hyphenating C . albicans , but not with heat-killed C . albicans , a yeast-locked strain of C . albicans or inert fungal cell wall components such as zymosan and β-glucan ( curdlan ) ( Fig 8D–8F ) . Similar results were obtained when supernatant of freshly isolated mouse oral keratinocytes stimulated with C . albicans was added to MS1 cells ( S8 Fig ) . This indicated that a C . albicans-induced TDK-derived soluble factor was responsible for G-CSF production by endothelial cells . To test whether this factor was IL-1α , we added anakinra ( IL-1R antagonist ) or a neutralizing anti-IL-1α antibody into the supernatant-transfer assay . This resulted in a complete abolishment of the response ( Fig 8G–8I ) , while adding an anti-IL-1β antibody had no effect on G-CSF induction by TDK-derived factors ( Fig 8I ) , consistent with the notion that IL-1β was not produced by murine keratinocytes ( Fig 7B ) . IL-1α was not only necessary but also sufficient for triggering G-CSF production in endothelial cells , because MS1 cells secreted large quantities of G-CSF when stimulated with recombinant IL-1α ( Fig 8J ) . In summary , these results revealed a novel IL-1α-dependent crosstalk between epithelial and endothelial cells that mediates the induction of G-CSF by C . albicans . In conclusion , our data corroborate the notion that the epithelium takes an active part in host defense in barrier tissue through its strategic location and by alerting the immune system about the presence of a pathogenic threat . By demonstrating the relevance of IL-1α release ( for G-CSF induction ) and chemokine secretion , we provided an example in a physiologically relevant system .
In this study , we describe an essential function of the IL-1 pathway in antifungal immunity in the murine oral mucosa . We demonstrated how IL-1R signaling regulates the neutrophil response against C . albicans in two ways to prevent fungal growth and dissemination . Specifically , it promotes the production of chemokines by oral keratinocytes for neutrophil recruitment from the circulating pool , and it induces G-CSF secretion from endothelial cells to enhance granulopoiesis in the bone marrow to meet the rapid demand for neutrophils in the tissue . IL-1R signaling thereby translates the local response to a tissue-specific infection into a systemic response . The availability of preformed IL-1α from keratinocytes , which are the first cells to be exposed to C . albicans during infection , is critical for the initiation of the response . Together , our data demonstrate how signaling through the IL-1R coordinates a cellular crosstalk between keratinocytes , endothelial cells and neutrophils for optimal control of C . albicans in the oral mucosa . Rapid infiltration of neutrophils to the site of infection is a hallmark of the inflammatory response to OPC and critical for the confinement of the fungus in the mucosal epithelium [6] . The neutrophil response in the oral mucosa was originally thought to be controlled by the IL-17 pathway , which itself is highly critical for fungal control during OPC [14] . However , previous work from our laboratory showed that the key protective function of IL-17 is uncoupled from the neutrophil response [6] . Although IL-17 signaling can enhance the expression of neutrophil chemokines and granulopoietic factors [14] , IL-17 is not required for neutrophil chemotaxis and function during OPC [6] . Instead , neutrophil trafficking to the oral mucosa during acute infection is under the control of IL-1R signaling as our data demonstrate . IL-1R deficiency is associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment and defective fungal control in response to OPC . Our data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating a role for IL-1R signaling in antifungal defense in different settings including systemic candidiasis [24] , a model of mixed oral and systemic candidiasis [34] , A . fumigatus keratitis [35] and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [36] . The mechanism of IL-1R-mediated protection , however , was not addressed in most of these studies . Here , we used the model of OPC to dissect the impact of IL-1R signaling on neutrophil mobilization and recruitment in response to C . albicans infection at a cellular and molecular level . Keratinocytes take center stage in the coordination of the IL-1-mediated neutrophil response during OPC . They act as the major producers of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines . Chemokine production by keratinocytes was greatly enhanced by IL-1R signaling and at least in part through the autocrine activity of IL-1α . A similar mechanism for enhanced chemokine secretion by keratinocytes was described before in the context of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection [37] . A second mechanism , by which keratinocytes promote the neutrophil response during OPC , is by the induction of G-CSF via their capacity to produce IL-1α . Our data thus link IL-1 signaling and G-CSF production . G-CSF regulates granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow , which is critical to meet the rapidly increasing demand of neutrophils in the infected tissue . Administration of recombinant G-CSF in mice is sufficient to drive emergency granulopoiesis as we and others have shown [38] , and recombinant G-CSF is widely used therapeutically to treat neutropenia [39] . G-CSF has also been used successfully in the treatment of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [40] . Besides its host-beneficial role in hematopoiesis and protection from infection , dysregulated production of G-CSF has been linked to autoinflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and inflammatory arthritis [41–43] and targeting G-CSF has been proposed as a therapeutic approach against these diseases [44] . We identified endothelial cells in the oral tissue to be the major producers of G-CSF during OPC , while we were unable to detect G-CSF expression by murine keratinocytes in response to C . albicans . Direct secretion of G-CSF into the bloodstream by endothelial cells facilitates its delivery to the distant bone marrow and the induction of a systemic response . During systemic bacterial infections , G-CSF production by the endothelium was shown to be a direct and TLR4-dependent response of the vasculature to endotoxin stimulation which lead to the induction of emergency granulopoiesis [38] . During OPC , we found no evidence for direct response of the endothelium to C . albicans , and endothelial cells were not activated by the fungus in vitro . Instead , G-CSF was produced as a result of an IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells . IL-1α was critical for the secretion of G-CSF into the circulation during OPC , and it was sufficient for stimulating G-CSF production by endothelial cells in culture , consistent with a published report [31] . In contrast , TNF , which was also reported to induce G-CSF production by endothelial cells in vitro [31] , did not regulate G-CSF production during OPC . In addition to IL-1α , IL-1β also contributes to the antifungal response in vivo and at least partially compensates in absence of IL-1α . IL-1β was also induced in the oral mucosa during infection . Consistent with the notion that murine keratinocytes are unable to produce IL-1β [28] , we found this cytokine to be expressed by the hematopoietic compartment . IL-1β induction in response to C . albicans was shown previously to depend on the NLRP3 inflammasome in different infection models [21 , 34 , 45] and NLRP3 was required in the hematopoietic compartment [29] . In addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome , the NLRC4 inflammasome was also shown to contribute to protection from OPC [29] . Whether its function at the level of the mucosal stroma is linked to the IL-1 pathway and whether it is involved in IL-1α production in keratinocytes was not addressed . We found that the overall IL-1α response resulted from the release of preformed and intracellularly stored IL-1α on the one hand , and from the induction of de novo synthesis on the other hand . The release of IL-1α from keratinocytes correlates with the induction of cell damage [46] , suggesting that IL-1α release may be a consequence of cell death induced by fungal invasion . It remains to be determined whether IL-1α secretion by oral keratinocytes in response to C . albicans infection depends on caspase-1 as was shown to be the case for bone marrow-derived MNPs differentiated with GM-CSF [20] . The dependence of IL-1α secretion on life and filamenting fungus is consistent with the implication of candidalysin in this process . This fungal peptide toxin has recently been identified as a critical virulence factor promoting epithelial cell damage and the release of cytoplasmic molecules , some of which may act as alarmins [47] . Importantly , our data demonstrate the biological relevance of keratinocyte-derived factors induced by C . albicans for the induction of inflammation and protection from infection in vivo , and they dissect the mechanism how IL-1 coordinates the neutrophil response against the fungus in the oral epithelium .
All mouse experiments described in this study were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Protection Law and were performed under protocols approved by the Veterinary office of the Canton Zurich , Switzerland ( license number 201/2012 and 183/2015 ) . All efforts were made to minimize suffering and ensure the highest ethical and humane standards . WT C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Elevage . Il1a-/- mice ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf ) [48] , Il1b-/- mice [48] ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf and Hans-Dietmar Beer ) and Il1r1-/- mice [49] were bred at the Laboratory Animal Service Center ( University of Zürich , Switzerland ) . VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] and Tnf-/- mice ( a kind gift from Annette Oxenius ) [50] were bred at the Rodent Center HCI at ETH Zürich . All mice were on the C57BL/6 background , kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 6–15 weeks of age . For neutrophil depletion , mice were treated with anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , BioXCell , 150μg per mouse i . p . on day -1 ) and/or anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&D Systems , 10μg per mouse per day i . p . starting from day -1 ) , as indicated . For inhibition of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were treated with anti-G-CSF ( 10μg per mouse per day i . p . on day -1 and day 0 ) . For induction of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were injected with human recombinant G-CSF ( Filgrastim , Amgen , 5 μg/mouse i . p . at 5h and 17h post-infection ) . The C . albicans strain SC5314 was used for all experiments except where stated otherwise . The yeast-locked strain hgc1Δ/Δ and its revertant hgc1Δ/Δ:HGC1 [51] were obtained from N . Gow ( Aberdeen ) . The strain pACT1-GFP [52] was obtained from C . Reis e Sousa . All strains were grown in YPD medium at 30°C for 15–18 hours . Mice were infected with 2 . 5x106 cfu C . albicans sublingually as described [53] without immunosuppression . Mice were monitored for morbidity and euthanized in case they showed severe signs of pain or distress . For determination of fungal burden , the tongue of euthanized animals was removed , homogenized in sterile 0 . 05% NP40 in H2O for 3 minutes at 25 Hz using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) and serial dilutions were plated on YPD agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin . The detection limit corresponds to one colony divided by the mean weight of the tongues in the experiment . For heat-killing 108 yeast cells were boiled for 45 minutes . Preformed hyphae were generated in keratinocyte medium at 37°C , 5% CO2 for 24 hours . Mice were anaesthetized with a sublethal dose of Ketamine ( 100 mg/kg ) , Xylazin ( 20 mg/kg ) and Acepromazin ( 2 . 9 mg/kg ) , and perfused by injection of PBS into the right heart ventricle prior to removing the tongue and/or the bones . Tongues were cut into fine pieces and digested with DNase I ( 200 μg/ml , Roche ) and Collagenase IV ( 4 . 8 mg/ml , Invitrogen ) in PBS at 37°C for 45–60 minutes . Single cell suspensions were passed through a 70 μm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2 mM EDTA and analyzed by flow cytometry ( see below ) . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue leukocytes were enriched over a 40% percoll gradient before antibody staining and analysis . Bone marrow was flushed from femurs using PBS and passed through a 70 μm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2mM EDTA . Erythrocytes were lyzed using erythrocyte lysis buffer ( 0 . 3 M NH4Cl , 28 μM NaHCO3 , 125 μM EDTA ) , and leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry . Tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) were obtained from WT mice . The tongue was cut to obtain ventral and dorsal parts . The dorsal part of the tongue was freed from muscle tissue with a scalpel and floated on DMEM ( PAA ) containing 0 . 8% trypsin ( Thermo Fischer ) for 40 minutes with the epithelial side facing upwards . After incubation , the epithelial tissue was separated from the lamina propria , and keratinocytes were isolated by incubating in DMEM medium containing DNase I ( Roche , 200 μg/ml ) for 30 minutes and occasional vortexing and filtering through a 70 μm strainer . The cells were pelleted , resuspended in keratinocyte medium ( S1 Table , adapted from [54] ) and cultivated in cell culture plates coated with collagen ( Bornstein and Traub Type IV , Sigma Aldrich , 25μg/ml ) . The blood endothelial cell line MS1 [33] was kept in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FCS and Penicillin/Streptomycin . Prior to stimulation experiments , TDK and MS1 cells were rested for 48 hours and then stimulated with recombinant IL-1α ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , IL-1β ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , anakinra ( 250 μg/ml ) , zymosan ( 20 μg/ml ) , curdlan ( 200 μg/ml ) , LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) or C . albicans at MOI = 3 for 24 hours . Amphotericin B was added 8 hours post-stimulation where stated explicitly . Supernatants were collected for analysis . In some cases , cell lysates were generated by adding 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS to the supernatant-free cells . To determine the total amount of IL-1α in cells and supernatant , Triton-X 100 was added to separate culture wells at a final concentration of 0 . 1% . For supernatant transfer experiments , TDKs were stimulated for 24 hours as described , supernatants were removed , sterile-filtered and added to MS1 cells at a 1:3 dilution . G-CSF production by MS1 cells was determined by ELISA after 24 hours ( see below ) . In some experiments , TDK supernatants were treated with anti-IL-1α ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell , 20 μg/ml ) and/or anti-IL-1β ( clone B122 , BioXCell , 20 μg/ml ) before they were added to MS1 cells , or MS1 cells were pretreated with anakinra for 30 minutes before addition of TDK supernatant . All antibodies were from BioLegend , if not stated otherwise . For flow cytometry analyses of neutrophils , single cell suspensions of tongues , bone marrow or blood were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain ( Life Technologies ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone AL-21 , BD Biosciences ) and anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) . For flow cytometry analyses of tongue keratinocytes and endothelial cells , single cell suspensions were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 , with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain or 7AAD ( BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-EpCAM ( clone G8 . 8 ) and anti-CD31 ( clone MEC13 . 3 ) . In some experiments , anti-podoplanin ( clone 8 . 1 . 1 ) was included . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue cells were first incubated in LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain and surface marker antibodies . After fixation and permeabilization using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm ( BD Biosciences ) the cells were incubated in Perm/Wash buffer ( BD Biosciences ) containing anti-pro-IL-1β ( clone NJTEN3 ) or the respective isotype control antibody . Cells were acquired on a FACS LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) or on a FACS Gallios ( Becton Coulter ) , and data were analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tristar ) . For all experiments , the data were pre-gated on live single cells . For isolating tongue cell subsets by FACS sorting , single cell suspensions of five tongues were pooled , stained as described above , and sorted on a FACS AriaII ( BD Biosciences ) using FCS as a collection medium . Isolation of total RNA from bulk tongues or sorted cell populations was carried out according to standard protocols using Trizol Reagent ( Sigma ) or Trizol LS Reagent ( Life Technologies ) . cDNA was generated by RevertAid ( Thermo Scientific ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green ( Roche ) and a Rotor-Gene 3000 ( Corbett Research ) or a QuantStudio 7 Flex ( LifeTechnologies ) . The primers were Actb fwd 5'-CCCTGAAGTACCCCATTGAAC-3' , Actb rev 5'-CTTTTCACGGTTGGCCTTAG-3'; Cxcl1 fwd 5'-CCGCTCGCTTTCTGTG-3' , Cxcl1 rev 5'-GCAGCTCATTGGCGATAG-3'; Cxcl2 fwd 5'-AGTGAACTGCGCTGTCAATGC-3' , Cxcl2 rev 5'-GCAAACTTTTTGACCGCCCT-3'; Cxcl5 fwd 5'- GAAAGCTAAGCGGAATGCAC-3' , Cxcl5 rev 5'-GGGACAATGGTTTCCCTTTT-3'; Csf3 fwd 5'-CTTAAGTCCCTGGAGCAAGTG-3' , Csf3 rev GTGGCCCAGCAACACCAG; Il1a fwd 5'-GGGAAGATTCTGAAGAAGAG-3' , Il1a rev 5'-TAACAGGATATTTAGAGTCG-3'; Il1b fwd 5'-TACAGGCTCCGAGATGAACA-3' , Il1b rev 5'-AGGCCACAGGTATTTTGTCG-3' . All qPCR assays were performed in duplicate and the relative gene expression ( rel . expr . ) of each gene was determined after normalization with β-actin transcript levels . For the preparation of cell lysates from sorted tongue cell populations , Brefeldin A ( 250 μg / mouse ) was injected i . p . 6 hours before removal of the tongue tissue . Brefeldin A was also added during the antibody staining and supplemented in the collection medium during cell sorting . Sorted cells were washed with PBS , and 400’000 cells of each population ( 60’000 for naïve leukocytes , 25’000 for LECs ) were lysed in 100 μl 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) for 3 minutes at 25 Hz . The G-CSF content of the lysates was analyzed immediately by ELISA ( see below ) . G-CSF protein in the serum , in cell lysates or in cell culture supernatants was determined by sandwich ELISA using purified anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&D Systems ) for coating and biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-G-CSF ( Peprotech ) for detection according to standard protocols . For determination of IL-1α and IL-1β levels in cell culture supernatants , cytometric bead array assays ( BD Biosciences ) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The detection limits are indicated by a dotted line . Tongues were embedded in OCT ( Sakura ) , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C . For immunofluorescence staining , sagittal cryosections ( 9 μm ) , were fixed with acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature and stained with anti-IL-1α ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell ) , anti-K6 ( BioLegend , poly19057 ) , anti-K14 ( BioLegend , poly19053 ) and 4′ , 6’-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI , Sigma-Aldrich ) . Slides were mounted with Mowiol ( VWR International AG ) , scanned with a NanoZoomer 2 . 0 HT ( Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) using 10x and 20x objectives , and analyzed using NDP . scan 2 . 5 . 88 . All scale bars indicate 100 μm . For whole mount confocal microscopy , tongues were longitudinally cut with a scalpel and fresh tissue was placed on 35mm microscopy dishes ( IBIDI ) with PBS . Z stack tile scans were acquired with an SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 20x APO objective ( 0 . 7 N . A . ) covering large areas of the tongue tissue . 3D maximum projections and mosaic reconstructions of the acquired data were generated with IMARIS ( Bitplane ) . Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction , one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison test , or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test where appropriate using GraphPad Prism software with * , p < 0 . 05; ** , p < 0 . 01; *** , p < 0 . 001; **** p < 0 . 0001 . For data plotted on a logarithmic scale the geometric mean is indicated , and data were log-transformed before statistical analysis .","The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is a major risk factor for immunosuppressed individuals , and oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) is a frequent complication in patients with weakened cellular immunity . The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC . Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Materials' 'and'

3,"Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health .
As a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide , the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) imposes a severe physical and socioeconomic burden on 1 . 3 billion at-risk persons in 83 endemic countries . An estimated 120 million people are already infected with LF , with about 40 million suffering from overt clinical disease manifested as painful severe swelling due to lymphedema ( generally an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the limbs ) and hydrocele ( fluid accumulation in the scrotal sac ) . To rid the world of this debilitating disease , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) was begun in 2000 to guide endemic countries in implementing single-dose , once-yearly mass drug administration ( MDA ) using a combination of either albendazole+ivermectin or albendazole+diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) for an anticipated 4–6 years . Use of this effective strategy for LF elimination has become feasible because of the drug donations of albendazole and ivermectin from their pharmaceutical manufacturers , GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co . , Inc , respectively . Over the first 8 operational years of the GPELF ( 2000–2007 ) , more than 1 . 9 billion MDA treatments were administered to approximately 570 million individuals in 48 countries . This significant programmatic achievement has resulted in a notably beneficial impact on the health of endemic populations [1] . More than 6 million cases of hydrocele and 4 million cases of lymphedema have been prevented , resulting in over 32 million disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs ) averted and numerous quality-of-life benefits attained . What remains relatively undefined , however , is the economic significance of these achievements . Specifically , how much financial cost and loss of income is prevented over the lifetimes of individuals protected from LF due to the first 8 years of the GPELF ? And , what cost savings do national health systems realize from the reduction in LF infection and morbidity ? To date , few attempts have been made to examine LF from an economic perspective , particularly on a global level . Such data , however , is invaluable to policymakers , public health administrators , and program funders who may already be convinced that LF is a ‘best buy’ in global health but who lack precise estimates to support their conviction . This study offers such an economic analysis and estimates that following the first 8 years of the GPELF , US$21 . 8 billion of economic benefits will be gained by LF infected and non-infected individuals in MDA-treated areas , in addition to US$2 . 2 billion in health systems savings . Furthermore , though this economic assessment has not included the value of the many ancillary benefits on other concurrent infections that are effectively treated by the anti-LF drug regimens , it still leads to a far better understanding of the GPELF's true overall impact on one of society's most debilitating and widespread tropical diseases .
Key data sources are listed below , though specific sources are cited throughout the paper: For this analysis , two broad groups of individuals are recognized as economically benefitting from the MDA treatment given during the first 8 years of the GPELF: Those protected from acquiring infection ( and subsequent disease [specifically , hydrocele and/or lymphedema] ) ; Those already infected but protected from disease progression . These two groups can be segmented into four sub-populations ( detailed below and summarized in Table 1 ) ; together , they constitute the “benefit cohort population” . Population estimates for each sub-population were calculated using the same base figures and key assumptions as described previously [1]; namely that 10% of the at-risk population is actually infected with LF , that this ratio would remain constant in the absence of MDA , and that the relative frequency of the clinical disease syndromes will also remain stable among those infected individuals . The previous section defined a 4-part benefit cohort population as the group of protected individuals who will realize economic benefits as a result of MDA activity between 2000–2007 . The total economic impact of the GPELF , however , extends over a much longer period than these first 8 years because protection from LF infection or disease progression is a lifelong benefit . It is therefore necessary to aggregate the total economic benefit gained over the projected remaining lifetime of the benefit cohort population . To estimate this total , a general formula ( Figure 1 ) was applied and calculated independently for each country to accommodate country specific differences in several key variables ( life expectancy , mortality rate , direct and indirect costs ) . All calculated costs and benefits are discounted to the base year of 2008 . For this study , 2008 was used as the base year for calculating economic benefits . When calculating future benefits , however , it is necessary to discount values to a net present value ( NPV ) under the economic principle that a dollar earned in the present is worth more than one earned in the future . Therefore , all annual accumulated cost savings beyond 2008 are discounted at 3% per year in accordance to guidelines set by WHO-CHOICE [53] . GPELF program costs can be compared with the economic benefits calculated in this study through a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the efficiency and practicality of implementing the Global Programme . Estimating program costs , however , is not the intent of this study and such data was , therefore , sourced through our previously published work [54] . On a macro-level , no study has yet been conducted to estimate the total cost of the GPELF over its first 8 years and as a result , a broader programmatic cost-benefit analysis cannot be calculated . It is possible , however , to estimate the cost-benefit on an individual-level using per person costs calculated in a multi-country study of national MDA program costs for LF including training , mapping , mobilization , distribution , monitoring , and surveillance [54] . In this study , Goldman et al . analyzed both the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs – set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) and also the financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) from data collected through questionnaires and adjusted for LF-specific activities . Donated ivermectin is used in combination with donated albendazole in areas co-endemic for onchocerciasis in Africa plus Yemen . DEC , which is not donated , is used in combination with donated albendazole in all other countries and must be purchased by national programs . In terms of per person economic benefits , the total economic benefits estimated over one year in this study was divided by the total number of people treated with MDA in that same year . For this analysis , per person economic benefits were only calculated for the 7 countries whose program costs were also evaluated in Goldman et al . 's study . Cost-benefit was then measured using benefit-cost ratios ( BCR ) , which is the per person treated benefit divided by the per person treated cost . For standardization purposes , the BCR reflects costs , benefits , and currencies adjusted to the year of the most recent MDA round in Goldman et al . 's study .
During the first 8 years of LF MDA , the Global Programme delivered nearly 2 billion treatments and reached almost 570 million individuals in 48 of the 83 identified endemic countries ( Table 4 ) . As a result of these program achievements , 31 . 4 million individuals – defined in this study as the benefit cohort population – will gain economic benefits over their lifetime from averting direct treatment costs and indirect lost-labor costs . Of these 31 . 4 million individuals in the benefit cohort population , 2 . 7 million ( 8 . 6% ) would have acquired LF and subsequently progressed to clinical disease but were protected from infection altogether because of interruption of the transmission cycle by MDA . This group comprises the proportion of newborns ( 2 . 2 million ) that are protected by virtue of being born in MDA-treated areas , as well as other individuals in the general population ( 0 . 5 million ) protected because LF transmission has been interrupted . The remaining 28 . 7 million ( 91 . 4% ) individuals are those who were already infected at the time of MDA treatment but benefit from halted disease progression . This population group comprises individuals at the subclinical disease stage ( 9 . 4 million , [29 . 9%] ) who avoid clinical disease altogether and individuals at the clinical disease stage ( 19 . 3 million [61 . 6%] ) whose conditions may improve following MDA . As seen in Table 5 , the efforts in reaching and administering MDA to such a large population have produced extraordinary economic benefits over the first 8 years of the GPELF . An estimated US$21 . 8 billion will be saved over the lifetimes of the 31 . 4 million individuals who have or would have acquired clinical disease during this timeframe . This total amount results from summing the direct treatment costs ( $1 . 4b ) and indirect lost wages ( $20 . 4b ) prevented over the lifetime of each of the population groups under the assumptions and estimates previously outlined in Table 3 . Direct costs for acute disease were calculated based on the aggregate number of ADL episodes expected in the absence of MDA and the average cost incurred per episode . Chronic disease direct costs were derived from the percentage and total number of patients seeking treatment multiplied by the average cost spent per treatment . Indirect costs for both acute and chronic disease were calculated by accruing the equivalent workdays lost to LF and multiplying this total by the average daily wage . All average costs and rate of disease estimates were weighted annually by country-specific estimates and with respect to total number of person-years . On average , each individual of the benefit cohort population will avoid nearly $700 in LF-associated costs that would have accrued over his/her lifetime . This equates to the amount earned for 19 working days per person-year , thus preventing the loss of approximately 6 . 3% of annual income ( Table 6 ) . These sums and averages are even greater when considered in a single year-to-year perspective , since beyond 2008 , each year of economic benefit is discounted by 3% per year . Table 6 also shows that the infected patient sub-population groups ( i . e . clinical and subclinical ) have the greatest total lifetime benefits based on their larger proportion of the total benefit cohort population . On a per person lifetime average , however , subclinical ( Group 2a ) and ‘other protected individuals’ ( Group 1b ) benefits are larger . Figure 3 highlights the total economic benefit segmented by cost , morbidity , and clinical presentation . Economic benefits to national health systems resulting from reduced LF infections derive particularly from patient service costs averted in the public sector . Approximately US$2 . 2 billion in health system costs will be saved over the lifetime of the benefit cohort population ( Table 8 ) . Combined with the US$21 . 8 billion savings for individuals , the total economic benefit following the first 8 years of the GPELF is estimated at an extraordinary US$24 . 0 billion ( Figure 4 ) . This overall economic analysis of the GPELF's first 8 years does have notable limitations due to the lack of regionalized primary data concerning both epidemiological and socioeconomic factors associated with LF . Indeed , two sections of the model remain with particular uncertainty: 1 ) The degree to which MDA can reverse or return an individual with overt clinical disease to regular productivity , and 2 ) The relationship between hours lost and output/productivity lost due to disease . The total estimated economic impact is particularly sensitive to these variables because of the large number of clinical disease patients receiving MDA and the high proportion of total prevented costs that come from indirect labor costs . As a result , sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the range of economic benefits that can be achieved under varying estimates of each variable . Secondary sensitivity analyses investigating the frequency and duration of ADL episodes , and direct treatment costs indicated less variability of economic benefits when adjusting these parameters . Goldman et al . found the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs – set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) ranged from US$0 . 40 in Philippines to $5 . 82 in Tanzania . The average annual financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) ranged from US$0 . 06 in Burkina Faso to US$1 . 34 in Haiti [54] . One-year economic benefits per person treated in this study ranged from US$1 . 00 in Burkina Faso to US$4 . 56 in the Dominican Republic . Table 10 compares these economic benefit estimates with the economic and financial costs from Goldman et al . 's study to calculate country-specific BCRs . The economic cost BCR for the three African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen are lower ( 0 . 21–0 . 37 ) than those in countries using DEC+albendazole ( 1 . 23–8 . 59 ) . Since the drugs , however , are available at no cost to the GPELF , BCRs calculated using financial costs are more favorable , ranging from 1 . 64 in Egypt to 18 . 07 in the Philippines .
In Table 10 , the BCRs calculated with economic costs are low , particularly for the African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen . In reality , however , the whole foundation of the GPELF is the long-term , sustained commitment of drug donations offered by GlaxoSmithKline for albendazole and Merck & Co . , Inc . for ivermectin for as long as needed until LF is eliminated [72] , [73] . Because of this commitment , governments and donors will never have to finance these costs themselves; indeed , without these commitments there would be no GPELF . Therefore , understanding the financial costs ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) to the GPELF is more relevant for policy- and decision-making than is the analysis of economic costs . When comparing financial costs to economic benefits , then , Table 10 shows very favorable BCRs , including up to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . Whether examining financial or economic costs , the BCR becomes larger in the years beyond the recommended 5 rounds of MDA to achieve lifetime protection from LF . The Goldman et al . study [54] showed strong evidence that costs decrease after the initial year of implementation and after 5 rounds of MDA , the drug costs and majority of program activities would arguably subside dramatically as well . In the Philippines for example , by conservatively extrapolating the initial year's annual economic cost over 5 years , the cost to lifetime benefit ratio indicates that a $1 investment leads to a sizable return of $60 per individual treated . While this analysis does not account for costs following the 5th round of MDA ( e . g . post-MDA surveillance ) , it can be reasonably assumed that the BCR would still remain very significant . Indeed , even if annual economic costs were to persist at an equivalent rate for an additional 10 to 15 years , the economic rate of return per person treated is still approximately $20–$30 for every $1 invested . Comparing the cost-benefit of the GPELF to that of other NTD programs is difficult because there are few directly comparable analyses , particularly at a global level . A review of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control ( APOC ) projected an economic rate of return of 6% to 17% but did not factor in the implied economic cost of the donated drug [74] . This finding is less than the drug-excluded LF cost-benefit estimate presented here , however , several economic benefits apart from onchocercal blindness prevention were not analyzed in the APOC review . Cost-benefit analyses for trachoma have focused almost exclusively on trichiasis surgery in a localized context [75] . A broader array of cost-benefit studies has been carried out for malaria , although with differing scopes and outcome goals , making it challenging to compare results across the same disease , let alone between malaria and LF . In a review of several malaria costing studies , the BCR ranged from 1 . 9 to 17 . 1 using a variety of human capital and burden of disease methodologies [76] . Other approaches assessing a more macroeconomic impact of malaria [77] , [78] have yet to be applied to NTDs but future research into such cost-benefit applications will be critical for validating the investment of the GPELF and stimulating likeminded investigations for related global NTD programs . There has been considerable movement – particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa – toward integrating preventive chemotherapy programs to target multiple NTDs ( e . g . LF , onchocerciasis , schistosomiasis , soil-transmitted helminths [STH] , trachoma ) together . Although there is no clear verdict yet on the benefits of integrated NTD treatments versus standalone vertical programs , early assessments indicate potential savings of 25–47% for the entire group of NTDs can be achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa by packaging MDA interventions together [79] . These findings underlie an important concept of economic analysis , specifically that although an intervention ( e . g . vertically integrated MDA programs for LF ) may have a favorable BCR , there may be more cost-effective alternatives to achieving a similar outcome ( e . g . the number of treatments administered , the total economic benefits of the GPELF ) . In this respect , the GPELF is well positioned to take advantage of synergistic opportunities with other disease program activities including vector control ( malaria and dengue fever ) , surveillance ( guinea worm , onchocerciasis ) , and distribution ( integrated NTDs , Vitamin A ) to maximize cost-effectiveness and economic impact [80] . Joint efforts with the private sector and drug development projects addressing improved sanitation and housing facilities could also contribute to greater cost-effectiveness for the GPELF [81] . While this study is not positioned to analyze cost-effectiveness in details , it is abundantly clear that under any joint or standalone scenario , the GPELF indeed represents an excellent buy in global health . The prevention of LF infection and clinical disease has led to additional benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify in monetary terms . The true economic value of the GPELF is , therefore , arguably much higher based on the numerous quality-of-life benefits achieved through clinical disease aversion , as well as the economic impact that MDA has on other diseases and syndromes related to LF . A narrow range of country-specific primary data somewhat limits the breadth of economic analysis presented in this paper; however , much of the prevailing literature originates from India and Sub-Saharan African countries where over 75% of the benefit cohort population resides . Of significance , there is scarce regional data regarding treatment-seeking behavior for LF patients , but because this is a direct cost input , more exact data would result in only marginal changes to the overall economic impact . Similarly , LF disease-specific parameters ( e . g . ADL frequency and duration , lost workdays ) were attributed a global standardized estimate due to a lack of regional data . Sensitivity analyses conducted earlier in this study presented the resulting economic impact under differing degrees of pathology and indeed , a clearer understanding of regional variability would enrich future economic analyses . Other variables such as wages , health system costs , and direct treatment costs , however , were able to be made region- and country-specific with the aid of international databases from the ILO , WHO , and World Bank . Despite important limitations to our analysis , this study identifies a wide array of economic benefits that have resulted from the first 8 years of the GPELF – approximately US$21 . 8 billion of direct and indirect patient costs will be prevented in the lifetimes of more than 31 million individuals , US$2 . 2 billion of LF-associated patient services saved by national health systems over the lifetimes of the MDA-treated individuals , and additional quality-of-life benefits and treatment of co-morbidities such as STH that make the total economic value of the GPELF unquestionably far greater than the calculable estimate presented here . These achievements notwithstanding , it is clear that the economic impact will be even greater when the GPELF reaches the remaining endemic countries and at-risk populations . Currently , the GPELF has extended to 48 of the 83 endemic countries and treated nearly 570 million individuals – approximately 44% of the ∼1 . 3 billion worldwide at-risk population [8] . Extrapolating this proportion with the US$24 billion lifetime economic benefit already achieved , the full potential economic benefit of the GPELF could be in excess of US$55 billion distributed over each of the endemic WHO regions ( Figure 5 ) . Reaching the remaining at-risk individuals presents notable challenges especially since much of the population not yet reached resides in some of the poorest countries in Africa . Additional resources and economic empowerment will be necessary to assist these countries in implementing programs for LF elimination [91] . The expansion of the GPELF will therefore be a critical building block in this effort and also an important driver for increased attention to NTDs and the continuation of integrated NTD programs . The recognition of the sizable monetary benefit already achieved after 8 years provides new confidence that it is an investment well worth undertaking .","Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) , commonly known as ‘elephantiasis’ , is one of the world's most debilitating infectious diseases . In 83 countries worldwide , more than 1 . 3 billion people are at risk of infection with an estimated 120 million individuals already infected . A recent publication reviewing the health impact of the first 8 years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) demonstrated the enormous health benefits achieved in populations receiving annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) , as a result of infection prevented , disease progression halted , and ancillary treatment of co-infections . To date , however , no studies have estimated the economic value of these health benefits , either to the individuals or the societies afflicted with LF . Our study estimates that US$21 . 8 billion will be gained among individuals benefitting from just the first 8 years of the Global Programme , and an additional US$2 . 2 billion will be saved by the health systems of endemic countries . Treating endemic populations is possible at very low cost – particularly because of the generous drug donations from two pharmaceutical companies – but results in enormous economic benefits . Findings from this study yield a much clearer understanding the GPELF's full economic impact and strengthen the conviction that it is a ‘best buy’ in global health .",['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Methods' 'Results' 'Discussion'],"['infectious' 'diseases/neglected' 'tropical' 'diseases' 'infectious'

4,"Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene result in Gaucher disease ( GD ) , the most common lysosomal storage disease . Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .
Gaucher disease ( GD ) is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is caused by homozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) . Mutations in GBA lead to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) and result in the accumulation of its substrates , glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine[1 , 2] . GD is classically divided into three subtypes: a non-neuronopathic form ( type 1 ) , an acute neuronopathic form ( type 2 ) , and a subacute neuronopathic form ( type 3 ) . Visceral manifestations of all forms are characterized by hepatosplenomegaly , cytopenia , and skeletal disease . Pathologically , the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages , called Gaucher cells , are observed in the affected organs . Neurological manifestations of neuronopathic forms include brainstem dysfunction , intellectual disability , seizures , and myoclonic movement . Pathological features of neuronopathic forms are neuronal loss , astrogliosis , microgliosis , and perivascular accumulation of Gaucher cells[3] . The most severe neuronopathic form , called the perinatal lethal type , has also been reported[4] . Common presentations of patients with the perinatal lethal type are hydrops fetalis and congenital ichthyosis . Almost no residual GCase enzymatic activity is found in these cases . Because currently available therapies are ineffective for neurological manifestations , a strong demand exists for elucidation of the pathological mechanisms and the development of novel therapies . Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder . GBA has recently drawn considerable attention because heterozygous mutations in this gene confer a high risk for sporadic PD[5 , 6] . In addition , patients with type 1 GD also have an increased life-time risk of developing PD[7] . PD patients carrying GBA mutations show intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites , which are the pathological hallmarks of sporadic PD[3] . Several cellular , animal , and postmortem studies have indicated an association between GBA mutations and α-syn accumulation . For example , deficiency in GCase enzymatic activity causes lysosomal dysfunction and α-syn accumulation[8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12] . Increased α-syn in turn creates a vicious cycle by inhibiting the trafficking of GCase to lysosomes , thus leading to decreased GCase activity in lysosomes[9] . Consistent with this notion , mouse models overexpressing α-syn and postmortem tissue from patients with PD show reduced GCase activity in the brains[13 , 14 , 15] . Although several hypotheses have been proposed , further mechanisms of how GBA mutations contribute to the development of PD remain elusive . Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) are a versatile vertebrate animal model for disease research . These fish are easy to handle , have a relatively short generation time ( 2–3 months ) , produce a large number of progeny per generation , and have several inbred strains[16] . Importantly , medaka have an advantage as an animal model of PD due to endogenous α-syn in contrast to invertebrate models that lack α-syn . Moreover , several genetic manipulations can be performed in medaka in addition to established transgenic techniques[17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21] . So far , we have reported genetic PD models of medaka that develop locomotor dysfunction accompanied by the selective loss of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons[22 , 23] . Considering these lines of evidence , medaka have the potential to be a new animal model of PD . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka and found that homozygous GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka are a viable neuronopathic GD model . GBA-/- medaka developed remarkable α-syn accumulation in the brains and thus provide novel insights into the association of GBA mutations with α-syn accumulation . Furthermore , we revealed minimal contribution of endogenous α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka .
We generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka to investigate the mechanisms by which GBA mutation leads to PD . To identify medaka GBA orthologs , we searched the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) with the basic local alignment search tool and found only one ortholog of human GBA . We cloned the medaka GBA with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends and found that this gene has 11 exons encoding a protein of 522 amino acids . The amino acid sequence of medaka GBA showed 53% homology to that of human GBA ( S1 Fig ) . Next , we screened a targeting-induced local lesions in genome ( TILLING ) library for medaka GBA using a high-resolution melting assay[17 , 24] . We identified a nonsense mutant ( W337X ) and generated the nonsense mutant medaka by in vitro fertilization ( Fig . 1A ) . We examined GCase activity in the brains of GBA mutants after crossing with heterozygous mutants . GBAW337X/W337X ( GBA-/- ) medaka showed complete deficiency in GCase activity , and GBAWT/W337X ( GBA+/- ) medaka showed a decrease in GCase activity of about 50% compared to wild-type ( GBA+/+ ) medaka ( Fig . 1B ) . Although humans and mice lacking GCase activity die soon after birth[4 , 25 , 26] , GBA-/- medaka survived for more than 3 months , enabling us to analyze the pathological progression ( Fig . 1D ) . GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal rotating swimming movement at 2 months ( S1 , S2 Movie ) and the abnormal appearance of a bent spine at 3 months ( Fig . 1C ) . High levels of glucocerebroside accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 1E ) , whereas the amount of galactocerebroside , an isomer of glucocerebroside , was not changed . Glucocerebroside with C18 fatty acids was the most dominant type in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( S2 Fig ) , an observation that is consistent with the neuronopathic GD mouse model[27] . We performed pathological analyses of GBA-/- medaka . Patients with GD show Periodic acid-Schiff-positive Gaucher cells in affected visceral organs such as the liver , spleen , and bone marrow , whereas GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal Periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells in the spleen and kidney , but not in the liver , at 3 months ( S3 Fig ) . Next , we examined the brains of GBA-/- medaka and found abnormal cells with large vacuoles mainly in the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these cells were macrophage-like and had large vacuoles containing filamentous structures ( Fig . 2C ) . Similar filamentous structures are observed in Gaucher cells of patients with GD and mouse models of GD[26 , 28 , 29] . The staining intensity with Luxol fast blue was decreased , and single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) -positive cells were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating myelin loss and cell death , respectively . In situ hybridization for apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) , a microglial marker in teleost fish[30] , revealed proliferating activated microglia in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) . Teleost fish have glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) -expressing radial glial cells ( or ependymoglial cells ) instead of astrocytes as in mammals[31] . Humans and mice with neuronopathic GD show astrogliosis in their brains[3 , 32] , whereas neither proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells nor elevated levels of GFAP were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D , E ) . To investigate the type of neuronal cells that die in GBA-/- medaka , we counted the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -positive dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon , which corresponds to the human substantia nigra[33] , TH-positive noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus , and tryptophan hydroxylase ( TPH ) -positive serotonergic neurons in the superior raphe at 2 and 3 months . GBA-/- medaka showed progressive cell loss of all these neurons ( Fig . 2F ) . Consistent with these findings , the amount of TH was decreased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2G ) . Collectively , GBA-/- medaka exhibited neuronopathic GD-like pathology including progressive and non-selective neuronal loss . Medaka express α-syn , which is a protein consisting of 127 amino acids . To investigate α-syn pathology in GBA-/- medaka , we created a medaka α-syn antibody against the epitope of amino acids 90 to 104 ( S4A Fig ) . Medaka also express β-synuclein , γ-synuclein-a , and γ-synuclein-b in addition to α-syn , but these other synucleins do not have amino acid sequences homologous to the epitope of the medaka α-syn antibody ( S4B Fig ) . Next , we generated α-syn deletion mutant medaka using TALENs . Deletion of 11 bases near the start codon in α-syn resulted in a frame shift mutation ( S4C Fig ) . Wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous α-syn deletion mutant ( α-syn+/+ , α-syn+/- , and α-syn-/- , respectively ) medaka could be distinguished with PCR analysis of α-syn ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR analysis of α-syn mRNA revealed that α-syn-/- medaka did not express intact α-syn mRNA ( S4E Fig ) . Western blot analysis with the medaka α-syn antibody revealed a 14-kDa band , which was specifically found in α-syn+/+ medaka ( S4F Fig ) . The authenticity of the antibody was confirmed by the lack of immunostaining with the medaka α-syn antibody in the brains of α-syn-/- medaka ( S4G Fig ) . Consistent with the findings in mammals , medaka α-syn was mainly found presynaptically with immunoelectron microscopy ( S4H Fig ) . Then , we performed immunohistochemical analysis and found abundant α-syn accumulation in the brains of GBA-/- medaka at 3 months ( Fig . 3A ) . α-syn accumulation was also observed at 2 months , but not at 1 month ( S5 Fig ) . Abnormal structures observed with toluidine blue staining were similar to α-syn accumulations in size and distribution ( Fig . 3A ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous axonal swellings containing vacuoles and other various materials in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Figs . 3B , S6A ) . A considerable number of these vacuoles had double membranes and sometimes contained mitochondria , suggesting that these vacuoles were autophagosomes . Consistent with this , LC3 , an autophagosomal marker , accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , immunogold-labeled α-syn was detected in axonal swellings with immunoelectron microscopy ( Fig . 3C ) . Conventional and confocal double immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that accumulated α-syn colocalized with LC3 accumulations ( Fig . 3D ) , and a considerable portion of the α-syn signals in axonal swellings colocalized with LC3 signals ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . In addition to these findings , ubiquitin also accumulated in α-syn-positive axonal swellings ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . To examine the α-syn expression level and solubility , we performed sequential biochemical fractionation assays . The total amount of α-syn in the Triton-soluble fraction was not increased in GBA-/- medaka . However , when adjusted for the amount of neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) and considering the robust neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka , α-syn was significantly increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . The decreased amount of neurofilament also reflected the neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . No apparent α-syn band was detected in the Triton-insoluble , SDS-soluble fraction in all genotypes . In agreement with the accumulation of autophagosomes in axonal swellings , the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . Meanwhile , we also investigated the phenotypes of GBA+/- medaka because heterozygous mutations in GBA are a strong risk for PD[5 , 6] . However , GBA+/- medaka even at 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes including α-syn pathology , the numbers of TH-positive neurons , swimming movement , or the amounts of several neurotransmitters ( S7A–S7E Fig ) . Previous studies of GD mouse models reported that p62/SQSTM1 ( an autophagic substrate ) accumulates in neurons and astrocytes[34] , and the number of Cathepsin D-positive puncta is decreased in neurons[35] . These observations prompted us to examine the autophagy-lysosome pathway in GBA-/- medaka . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ubiquitin- and p62-positive aggregates were observed mainly in the perikarya of neurons ( Figs . 4A , D , S8B ) . These aggregates were observed only in neurons and not in GFAP-positive radial glial cells or Lycopersicon Esculentum ( Tomato ) Lectin ( LEL ) -positive microglia ( S8A Fig ) . LEL is an excellent teleost microglial marker[36] . Western blot analysis showed that the amounts of ubiquitin and p62 were increased in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast , these aggregates did not colocalize with LC3 accumulations or Cathepsin D-positive organelles ( Figs . 4D , S8B ) . These organelles , which are putative lysosomes , showed decreased Cathepsin D staining intensity and abnormal morphology ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistent with this , neurons that contained lysosome-like organelles filled with filamentous structures were observed with transmission electron microscopy ( Fig . 4B ) . GBA nonsense mutant medaka have random point mutations in the genome at loci other than GBA . Therefore , we performed a rescue experiment to determine whether the abnormal phenotypes observed in GBA-/- medaka were really caused by GBA mutation . We created medaka GBA-expressing vectors driven by a medaka growth-associated protein 43 ( GAP-43 ) promoter ( S9A Fig ) [37] . GAP-43 mRNA is expressed mainly in nervous system in medaka[37] . We established six medaka GBA transgenic lines ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) using these vectors and crossed them with GBA nonsense mutant medaka . Each line of GBA-/- medaka with GBA transgene ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- ) showed GCase activity of various levels in the brains at 3 months ( S9B Fig ) . All lines of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- medaka showed normal swimming movement at 2 months ( S3 Movie ) . Also , the swimming distance was increased in Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka ( S9C Fig ) . Pathological analysis of the brains of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka including hematoxylin and eosin staining , in situ hybridization for APOE , and immunohistochemistry for p62 and α-syn revealed no apparent abnormality ( S9D Fig ) . We concluded that the abnormal phenotypes observed in the brains of GBA-/- medaka were caused by the GBA mutation . Many studies have reported that accumulated α-syn caused by α-syn overexpression results in neurotoxicity[38] . Neuroinflammation is observed in the brains of patients with PD , and much evidence shows that neuroinflammation promotes disease progression[39] . Moreover , a recent study reported that oligomeric α-syn released from neurons activates inflammatory responses in microglia[40] . We examined the toxicity of α-syn in GBA-/- medaka by crossing GBA nonsense mutant medaka with α-syn deletion mutant medaka . α-syn-/- medaka showed no apparent abnormal phenotypes in their outer appearance , swimming movement , or life span like α-syn-disrupted mice[41] . The life spans of GBA-/-α-syn+/- and GBA-/-α-syn-/- medaka were not prolonged compared to that of GBA-/-α-syn+/+ medaka ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , the number of LC3-positive puncta was not changed in GBA-/-α-syn-/- medaka , indicating that α-syn was not primarily involved in formation of axonal swellings ( Fig . 5B ) . The numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus were not changed in either GBA-/- α-syn+/- or GBA-/- α-syn-/- medaka ( Fig . 5C ) . We also examined the extent of neuroinflammation with in situ hybridization for APOE and quantitative RT-PCR for tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) α mRNA . The number of APOE-positive cells and the expression level of TNFα were not changed ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Collectively , we found no evidence for α-syn involvement in the short life span , formation of axonal swellings , dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss , and neuroinflammation that are observed in GBA -/- medaka .
To date , several genetic animal models of neuronopathic GD including mouse , dog , and sheep have been reported[42] . Gba null mice die within 24 hours of birth due to permeability barrier defects in the skin[26 , 43] . Thus , conditional knockout K14-lnl/lnl mice with normal GCase activity in their skin were generated[27] . However , use of these mice is limited because they survive only 2 weeks after birth . Mice harboring a Gba missense mutation combined with prosaposin- or saposin C-deficient mice , another neuronopathic GD model , also show neuronopathic abnormalities[29 , 34] and have the advantage of longer survival than K14-lnl/lnl mice . However , the relevance of these mice to neuronopathic GD is controversial . The present study revealed that GBA-/- medaka survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . As an example , GBA-/- medaka showed α-syn accumulation at 2 months , not at 1 month after fertilization . Considering these observations , GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous α-syn accumulation . GBA-/- medaka showed several phenotypes different from those of mammalian neuronopathic GD model . Firstly , the skin of GBA-/- medaka looks intact whereas severe skin lesion is observed in patients with perinatal lethal type GD and Gba null mice[4 , 43] . Secondly , GBA-/- medaka exhibited PAS-positive abnormal cells in spleen and kidney which presumably correspond to human Gaucher cells . In patients with GD , Gaucher cells are not found in kidney , but in liver , spleen and bone marrow . These differences could be explained by the fact that in adult teleost fish kidney has hematopoietic function instead of mammalian bone marrow[44] . Lastly , the proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells was not observed in GBA-/- medaka whereas astrogliosis is observed in humans and mice with neuronopathic GD . It was reported that the reaction of GFAP-positive radial glial cells to inflammation is different from that of mammalian astrocytes[31] . Lysosomes play a fundamental role in the autophagic pathway by fusing with autophagosomes and digesting their contents[45] . In general , lysosomal dysfunction results in defective digestion and accumulation of autophagic substrates such as polyubiquitinated proteins , p62 , and dysfunctional mitochondria , accompanied by accumulation of autophagosomes . Axonal swellings containing autophagosome-like structures are observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases such as neuronopathic GD mice , Niemann-pick type C1 mice , Cathepsin D-deficient mice , and Cathepsin B/L double-deficient mice[34 , 46 , 47] . A previous study reported that autophagosomes are formed in the distal part of the axon and undergo retrograde transport toward the cell body[48] . Another previous study demonstrated that inhibition of lysosomal function in primary neurons from mouse embryos disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes and causes their accumulation in axons[49] . Considering these lines of evidence , we propose that GCase deficiency primarily causes lysosomal dysfunction , leading to disrupted retrograde transport of autophagosomes in axons and formation of axonal swellings with α-syn accumulation ( Fig . 6 ) . Contrary to our expectations , p62-positive aggregates did not colocalize with LC3- and α-syn-positive axonal swellings , but were mainly located in the perikarya of neurons . These results suggest the possibility that presynaptic α-syn is transported proximally and degraded in a p62-independent autophagy-lysosome pathway . A previous study supports this hypothesis . Conditional knockout mice lacking ATG7 in TH-positive neurons show α-syn aggregates in swollen axons in the striatum , but not in cell bodies in the midbrain , indicating that autophagic dysfunction initially causes α-syn aggregates in the distal part of axons[50] . In addition , another previous study demonstrated that α-syn aggregation occurs earlier in axons than in neuronal cell bodies in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in PD patients[51] . Because axonal retrograde transport may be involved in the degradative pathway of α-syn and may be a therapeutic target in PD , further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms . Because GBA+/- medaka as old as 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes , we could not directly investigate how heterozygous GBA mutations cause PD . Meanwhile , according to a recent report , induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations show α-syn accumulation , an impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway , and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis[12] . The reason for differences in phenotypes between in vivo and in vitro models is unclear . However , our findings from GBA+/- medaka seem to be reasonable because the penetrance of PD in GBA mutation carriers is estimated to be at most 30% by the age of 80 years[52] . Thus , second hits such as environmental factors and other genetic factors are probably required for the development of PD pathology in vivo . Cellular and animal PD models overexpressing α-syn have provided evidence for the various potential toxic mechanisms of α-syn . However , few studies have demonstrated the pathological role of endogenous α-syn in vivo , which may reflect the authentic role for α-syn in PD . A previous study showed that α-syn null mice are resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 , 2 , 3 , 6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) toxicity compared with wild-type mice[53] . However , it is unclear whether this improvement is due to attenuation of α-syn toxicity or α-syn-mediated changes in the presynaptic machinery . Another previous study showed that the formation of intraneuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration in 26S proteasome-depleted mice is independent of α-syn[54] . In the present study , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Moreover , α-syn was not involved in the accumulation of autophagosomes in axons . Our data indicate that α-syn accumulation is a downstream event , and other severe pathological factors may obscure the involvement of α-syn in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . In summary , the present study showed that GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous α-syn accumulation . Long-term survival of these fish allows us to observe the pathological progression . Our data revealed that GCase deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and α-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Axonal transport of α-syn may play an important role in the mechanisms of GBA mutations leading to PD and may also be a therapeutic target in PD . Furthermore , we demonstrate the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms and also provide a new platform for developing treatments in PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD .
Medaka were anesthetized in 0 . 02% tricaine in fish water and then sacrificed . All experimental procedures used in this study followed national guidelines . The Animal Research Committee of Kyoto University granted a formal waiver of ethical approval and also granted permission . Medaka of the Kyoto-cab strain , a substrain of Cab , were maintained at 27°C in a recirculating aquaculture system . Adult fish were kept in a reproduction regimen ( 14 hr light/10 hr dark ) . Eggs were kept in a dark box at 28°C . RNA was extracted from wild-type medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . To identify medaka GBA , SNCA , SNCGb , p62/SQSTM1 , and MAP1LC3B orthologs , we referred to the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) . Because their cDNA sequences and amino acid sequences were not completely known , we determined their cDNA sequences using a combination of RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends , the products of which were generated using Seegene’s Capfishing kit ( Seegene ) . The cDNA sequences can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive ( ENA , accession numbers LM644999–645003 ) . GBA mutant medaka were generated as described[17] . To find GBA mutations in the TILLING library , we narrowed down mutated candidates from 5 , 771 samples using a high-resolution melting assay , followed by determination of the DNA sequences[24] . We screened the TILLING library for exons 1–2 , exons 5–7 , exon 8 , and exons 9–11 of GBA . In vitro fertilization was carried out using sperm from a sample with the favorable mutation . To genotype the progeny of GBAWT/W337X mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5′-AGGGTTGAAGGGGTTAAGCA-3′ , 5′-TTGTAACCAGTACCGCAGCA-3′ ) , designed HybProbes ( 5′-LC Red 640-CATGTACCAGTGGACG-Phosphate-3′ , 5′-CCTAAGCTTATATCTGCAGGGACTAAACTGT-Fluorescein-3′ ) , and LightCycler 480 Probes Master in LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . The genotypes can be distinguished with high-resolution melting curve analysis . GBAWT/W337X mutants were back-crossed to Kyoto-Cab medaka at least seven times and then crossed to obtain GBAW337X/W337X mutants . For the rescue experiment , we established GBA transgenic medaka in which medaka GBA expression was driven by the medaka GAP-43 promoter ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) . We used an insulator located in the upstream region of sea urchin ( Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus ) arylsulfatase[55 , 56] . The transgenic construct was flanked by two insulators and included the medaka GAP-43 promoter followed by an internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) , enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) , and the Simian virus 40 polyadenylation site or the medaka β-actin 3′-untranslated region ( 3′UTR ) ( S8A Fig ) . The medaka GAP-43 promoter contained a 1 . 0-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the gene . A DNA fragment of the transgene was inserted into EcoR I/Sal I restriction enzyme sites of the pDs-actb2k-EGFP plasmid . pDs-actb2k-EGFP was constructed by inserting an Xho I/Spe I fragment from pactb2k-EGFP into the Xho I/Spe I site of the pDs-GTDEL4 plasmid , which contains 5′- and 3′-Ds sequences[21 , 57] . The resultant vector was injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized Kyoto-Cab eggs before the first cleavage as described[20] . α-syn deletion mutant medaka were generated with TALENs as described[58] . To genotype the progeny of α-syn deletion mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5′-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3′ , 5′-TGCAACTGTGGAAACACCAT-3′ ) , followed by electrophoresis in a 10% ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gel ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR for α-syn was performed with the following primer sets ( α-syn: 5′-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3′ , 5′-TTTGGAGAAACCCTTCATTAAC-3′; β-actin: 5′-TCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGTG-3′ , 5′-AGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′ ) ( S4E Fig ) . The spontaneous swimming movement of medaka was traced using a video camera positioned above the water tank and analyzed with ethovision XT 5 ( Noldus ) . The water tank was a transparent circular container ( 20 cm diameter , 2 cm water depth , room temperature ) . Image acquisition began 5 min after medaka were placed in a new water tank . Data were collected continuously for the subsequent 3 min . The assay for GCase enzymatic activity was performed as described[11] . Medaka brains were homogenized in 40 μl sample buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , pH 7 . 4 ) , sonicated , and centrifuged at 10 , 000 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . Aliquots containing 50 μg protein were incubated in assay buffer ( 5 mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside ( Wako , #324–37441 ) , 1% ( w/v ) sodium taurocholate ( Wako , #197–10033 ) , 50 mM sodium citrate , 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 5 . 0 ) in the presence or absence of 2 mM Conduritol B epoxide ( Toronto Research Chemicals , #C666000 ) in a total volume of 100 μl at 37°C for 4 hr . The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0 . 4 M glycine , pH 10 . 8 , and the fluorescence at 460 nm ( emission 355 nm ) was measured with Fluoroskan Ascent FL ( Thermo Fisher ) . Medaka brains were stored at—80°C until analyses and homogenized in 1 ml tissue homogenization buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 25 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris-HCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . Aliquots containing 1 mg protein were used for the analyses . Levels of glucocerebroside and galactocerebroside were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS as described with modification using SFC separation[59] . A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 90–104 of medaka α-syn conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin was used for immunization of rabbits . Serum was obtained 49 days after immunization and purified with affinity chromatography . Frozen and paraffin sections were used for immunohistochemical analyses . For frozen sections , medaka brains were fixed with 4% ( w/v ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at 4°C for 4 hr and then placed in 30% ( w/v ) sucrose at 4°C for more than 16 hr . Samples were embedded in Surgipath FSC 22 ( Leica ) , and 14-μm-thick sections were obtained with a LEICA CM 1900 . For paraffin sections , medaka brains were fixed in 4% ( w/v ) PFA at 4°C for 16 hr , dehydrated , and embedded in paraffin . Sections with a thickness of 6 to 20 μm were obtained with a Microm HM 325 . For immunohistochemical analyses , the following primary antibodies and a lectin were used: anti-Cathepsin D ( Calbiochem , #IM03 , 1:200 ) , anti-GFAP ( Sigma-Aldrich , #G3893 , 1:1000 ) , anti-LC3 ( Santa Cruz , #sc-16755 , 1:100 ) , anti-medaka α-syn ( 1:2000 ) , anti-p62 ( MBL , #PM045 , 1:2000 ) , anti-ssDNA ( DAKO , #A4506 , 1:2000 ) , anti-TH ( Millipore , #MAB318 , 1:1000 ) , anti-TPH ( Abcam , #ab3907–50 , 1:1000 ) , anti-ubiquitin ( Santa Cruz , #sc-8017 , 1:50 ) , anti-ubiquitin ( DAKO , #Z0458 , 1:1000 ) , and biotinylated Lycopersicon Esculentum ( Tomato ) Lectin ( VECTOR , #B-1175 , 5 <g/ml ) . The sections were incubated at 4°C with primary antibodies or lectin for 1 to 3 days and then processed for visualization . As secondary antibodies , ImmPRESS ( VECTOR ) was used for diaminobenzidine staining , and Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) were used for immunofluorescence . Sections were observed with an Olympus CX41 microscope , a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope ( KEYENCE ) , and an Olympus FV-1000 confocal laser scanning microscope . For confocal microscope images , Pearson's coefficient correlation ( r ) was calculated using Olympus software . RNA was extracted from medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was generated with reverse transcription using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . The amount of cDNA was quantified with real-time PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master ( Roche , #04887352001 ) and Roche LightCycler 480 . The following primer sets were used ( TNFα: 5′-ATTGGAGTGAAAGGCCAGAA-3′ , 5′-ACTAATTTGAGACCGCCACG-3′; β-actin: 5′-TCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGTG-3′ , 5′-AGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′ ) . The vector including a portion of the medaka APOE cDNA sequence was generously provided by Dr . H . Mitani ( Tokyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) ( in submission ) . In situ hybridization was performed as described[60] . Counterstaining was performed with methyl green ( Sigma-Aldrich , #M8884 ) . For Triton-soluble fractions , samples were homogenized in high-salt buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 ( 750 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris-HCl , 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , pH 7 . 5 ) and centrifuged at 20 , 400 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . For SDS-soluble fractions , the pellet was subsequently sonicated in SDS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 2% SDS , pH 7 . 4 ) followed by centrifugation at 20 , 400 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . The supernatant was boiled in sample buffer ( 1% ( w/v ) SDS , 12 . 5% ( w/v ) glycerol , 0 . 005% ( w/v ) bromophenol blue , 2 . 5% ( v/v ) 2-mercaptoethanol , 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 6 . 8 ) . Samples were separated on 10% , 12% , or 14% ( w/v ) gels for SDS-PAGE . Samples containing 20 μg protein were loaded in each lane for Triton-soluble fractions , and SDS-soluble fractions were loaded according to the amount of protein in Triton-soluble fractions . Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell ( Bio-Rad ) . For detection of medaka α-syn and mouse α-syn , the membranes were treated with 0 . 4% ( w/v ) PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature before blocking to prevent detachment of α-syn from the blotted membranes[61] . For western blot analyses , the following primary antibodies were used: anti-β-actin ( Sigma-Aldrich , #A1978 , 1:5000 ) , anti-GFAP ( Sigma-Aldrich , #G3893 , 1:1000 ) , anti-LC3 ( MBL , #PM036 , 1:2000 ) , anti-NSE ( DAKO , #M0873 , 1:500 ) , anti-α-syn ( BD Transduction , #610787 , 1:2000 ) , anti-medaka α-syn ( 1:10 , 000 ) , anti-phosphorylated neurofilament ( COVANCE , #smi-31r , 1:1000 ) , anti-p62 ( MBL , #PM045 , 1:500 ) , anti-TH ( Millipore , #MAB318 , 1:1000 ) , and anti-ubiquitin ( Santa Cruz , #sc-8017 , 1:50 ) . The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 to 3 days at 4°C , followed by reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies ( Santa Cruz ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Immunoreactive bands were detected with Chemi-Lumi One Super ( Nacalai tesque ) , and the chemiluminescent signal was detected with Fujifilm LAS-3000 . Densitometric analyses were performed using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . To measure the amounts of dopamine , noradrenaline and serotonin in medaka brains , high performance liquid chromatography was performed as described[60] . Medaka brains were fixed with 4% ( w/v ) PFA and 2% ( v/v ) glutaraldehyde ( Wako , #072–01961 ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) at 4°C for 16 hr . After rinsing in 0 . 1 M PB , samples were postfixed with 1% ( w/v ) OsO4 in 0 . 1 M PB for 2 hr . Then , samples were dehydrated , penetrated with ethanol and a propylene oxide series , and embedded in Epon . Sections were obtained with an EM UC6 ultramicrotome ( Leica ) . Sections with a thickness of 1 μm were used for toluidine blue staining . Sections with a thickness of 60 to 80 nm were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope . Immunoelectron microscopy using ultrathin cryosections was performed as described[62] . Briefly , brains were quickly removed from medaka and immersed in 4% PFA buffered with 0 . 1 M PB ( pH 7 . 2 ) at 4°C for 2 hr , washed thoroughly with 7 . 5% sucrose in 0 . 1 M PB ( pH 7 . 2 ) , and embedded in 12% gelatin . The samples were rotated in 2 . 3 M sucrose in 0 . 1 M PB overnight at 4°C , placed on a specimen holder ( Leica Microsystems ) , and quickly plunged into liquid nitrogen . Ultrathin cryosections were cut with a Leica UC6/FC6 and UC7/FC7 ( Leica Microsystems ) at about—120°C . Sections about 60 nm thick were picked up with a 1:1 mixture of 2% methylcellulose and 2 . 3 M sucrose and transferred to a nickel grid with a carbon-coated Formvar supporting film . The sections were rinsed with PBS containing 0 . 02 M glycine , treated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS , and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-medaka α-syn antibody ( 1:30 ) . They were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold particles ( 1:40 ) ( British Biocell International ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Immunostained sections were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS . After completion of the labeling , the sections were embedded in a thin layer of 2% methylcellulose with 0 . 4% uranyl acetate ( pH 4 . 0 ) , air-dried , and observed with a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope . For control experiments , ultrathin sections were reacted only with the gold particle-conjugated secondary antibody . A two-tailed paired Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test was used for analyses . Statistical calculations were performed with Microsoft Excel or GraphPad Prism Software , Version 5 . 0 .","Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites . Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) , a causative gene of Gaucher disease ( GD ) , are a strong risk for PD . However , its pathological mechanisms leading to PD remain largely unknown . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka which survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . These mutant medaka display not only the phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD but also axonal accumulation of α-syn accompanied by impairment of the autophagy-lysosome pathway . Furthermore , the present study demonstrates this α-syn accumulation has negligible contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms of PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD , and our findings have important implications for the association of GBA mutations with PD .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Materials' 'and'

5,"Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen capable of inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection . The capacity of L . monocytogenes to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is paramount for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell–mediated protective immunity . Here , we show that the impaired T cell response to L . monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation , but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response . This suppression limited not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L . monocytogenes , but negated the response to bacteria within the cytosol . Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L . monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain alone . Bacteria confined to a phagosome suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10 . Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restored protective immunity . Our studies demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells .
The intracellular bacterium L . monocytogenes has been studied for decades as a model of innate and cellular immunity [1] . Infection with L . monocytogenes leads to a robust innate and adaptive response , characterized by the generation of long-lived antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells [2] , the latter of which are predominantly responsible for protective immunity [3] , [4] . Following engulfment by the host cell , L . monocytogenes escapes from the phagosome and into the host cell cytosol via secretion of the pore-forming cytolysin , listeriolysin O ( LLO ) [5] . Once within the cytosol , the bacteria express ActA that facilitates cell to cell spread via polymerization of host-cell actin [6] . ActA-deficient mutants still induce protective immunity , while mutants lacking LLO ( sometimes designated as Δhly ) elicit an antigen-specific T cell response , but these T cells are unable to provide protective immunity [7] , [8] . Escape of L . monocytogenes into the cytosol permits bacterial growth and facilitates the MyD88-independent activation of a cytosolic surveillance pathway , leading to the production of a unique array of cytokines , including type I IFN [9]–[12] . What remains unclear is why L . monocytogenes , which contains ligands for multiple Toll-like receptors found on the cell surface and within the phagosome , only elicits effective adaptive immunity when entering the host cell cytosol [13] , [14] . Innate immune recognition of L . monocytogenes is critical for controlling early microbial replication [2] . Interaction of the bacterium with host pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) triggers a cascade of cytokines and chemokines that both recruits and arms innate immune effectors [15] , [16] . L . monocytogenes contains ligands for TLR2 ( peptidoglycan , lipotechoic acid and lipoproteins ) , TLR5 ( flagellin ) , TLR9 ( CpG motifs ) , and NOD2 ( muramyl dipeptide ) , all of which may elicit proinflammatory cytokine secretion [17]–[22] . Rapid secretion of chemokines such as MCP-1 and MCP-3 , and cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF are essential for enhancing the recruitment and bacteriocidal functions of macrophages and neutrophils , which act to restrict bacterial burden prior to the onset of the adaptive response [23]–[25] . Typically suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 are also elicited in response to L . monocytogenes infection where they may contribute to bacterial persistence as well as T cell potency [26]–[28] . The innate response to these PRR-ligands also serves to shape the ensuing adaptive immune response [29] . Innate inflammatory cytokines produced in response to L . monocytogenes infection facilitate dendritic cell ( DC ) maturation and migration to the infection-associated secondary lymphatics [29] , [30] . Maturation is essential for enhancing the stimulatory capacity of the DC via upregulation of costimulatory surface molecules and cytokines ( e . g . CD80/86 , CD70 , IL-12p70 , IL-18 , IFN-α/β ) [31] . Maturation also facilitates migration of the DC into the draining lymph node where it can interact with large numbers of naïve T cells [32] . Together , the local cytokine milieu and dendritic cell maturation state significantly contribute to the outcome of the DC-T cell interaction and ultimately , the potency of the T cell response [33] . We questioned how the response to a bacterium confined within a phagosome would impact the adaptive response to a bacterium within the host cell cytosol . Mice were infected with two distinct strains of L . monocytogenes . The first strain , ActA-Lm , escapes into the host cell cytosol and elicits long-lived CD8 T cell-dependent protective immunity [23] , [34] . Because it cannot spread between cells , ActA-Lm is highly attenuated in vivo , can be administered at a higher dose , and is rapidly cleared from both liver and spleen ( relative to wild-type L . monocytogenes ) . A second strain , LLO-Lm , is unable to produce listeriolysin O ( LLO ) , and thus cannot escape from the phagosome [35] . Importantly , infection with LLO-Lm elicits CD8 T cells , but little or no protective immunity to a lethal wild-type L . monocytogenes challenge [7] , [8] . To facilitate enumeration of L . monocytogenes-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses following infection , we used strains expressing chicken ovalbumin ( OVA ) fused to a non-lytic fragment of LLO .
To better understand the impact of phagosome-confined bacteria on the adaptive immune response we infected cohorts of mice with an identical dose of ActA-Lm-OVA ( 1×105 colony forming units ( CFU ) ) , a dose sufficient to elicit long-lived CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity . To this inoculum , we added increasing numbers of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA . We assessed protective immunity 60 days later by challenging with wild-type-L . monocytogenes-OVA , and then enumerating CFU in the spleen ( Figure 1A ) . Strikingly , the protective immunity typically elicited by ActA-Lm-OVA was compromised by the presence of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA during primary infection . In other words , despite a significant increase in antigen during primary infection , the adaptive response to the cytosolic bacterium was impaired by the presence of bacteria within a phagosome . A potential explanation for this finding was that the addition of LLO-Lm-OVA to the inoculum facilitated more rapid clearance of ActA-Lm-OVA , decreasing the duration of antigen presentation and negatively impacting T cell potency . To test this hypothesis , we used an erythromycin-resistant strain of ActA-Lm ( ActA-Lm-ErmR ) combined with a large number of LLO-Lm ( 1×108 CFU ) . We followed the clearance of the ActA-Lm-ErmR strain by enumerating CFU on agar containing erythromycin ( Figure 1B , C and D ) . Importantly , the addition of LLO-Lm did not impact the rate at which ActA-Lm-ErmR were cleared from the spleen or liver or the in vitro growth rate within bone marrow-derived macrophages . To determine whether the phagosome-confined bacteria required metabolic activity , heat-killed L . monocytogenes were added to an inoculum of ActA-Lm ( Figure 1E ) . Similar to our observations with LLO-Lm , the addition of HK-L . monocytogenes also limited protective immunity . In a similar fashion , the addition of the unrelated phagosome-confined non-pathogenic bacterium Bacillus subtilis also attenuated protective immunity ( Figure 1F ) . Finally , the addition of LLO-Lm-OVA to an inoculum of wt-L . monocytogenes also impaired protective immunity ( Figure 1G ) . Similar observations were made during experiments utilizing Balb/c mice ( data not shown ) . Thus , as few as 9×105 CFU of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA added to an inoculum of cytosolic ActA-Lm-OVA during primary infection leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in CFU following wild-type challenge . Given the role of CD8 T cells in protective immunity , we questioned how the addition of increasing numbers phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA would impact the primary T cell response to a constant dose of ActA-Lm-OVA . Similar to our observations following wild-type L . monocytogenes challenge , the 10 to 1000-fold increase in the number of OVA-expressing bacteria did not improve the primary T cell response . Instead , the magnitude of the primary CD8 OVA257–264 and CD4 LLO190–201–specific response declined as the ratio of phagosome-confined to cytosolic bacteria increased ( Figure 2 ) . The frequency of OVA257–264-specific CD8+ T cells determined by IFN-γ staining was confirmed using Kb-OVA257–264 multimers to rule out the existence of OVA257–264 -specific CD8+ T cells incapable of producing IFN-γ . To understand if suppression of the T cell response was antigen specific , we performed similar studies using LLO-Lm that did not express OVA ( Figure 3A ) . These studies demonstrated that suppression was antigen-independent , as LLO-Lm expresses neither the OVA257–264 nor the LLO190–201 epitopes . Furthermore , the reduced magnitude of the primary response was independent of the class I-restricting allele or the affinity of the MHC-peptide interaction as observed using L . monocytogenes strains expressing four defined vaccinia virus-derived epitopes ( Figure 3B ) [36] . Therefore , the presence of LLO-Lm within a phagosome negatively impacts both the primary CD4 and CD8 T cell response to cytosolic ActA-Lm as well as protective immunity . The innate immune response during infection plays a critical role in shaping the ensuing adaptive response . Based on the observed suppression of CD4 and CD8 T cell responses , we hypothesized that the presence of phagosome-confined L . monocytogenes altered the inflammatory cytokine response to the cytosolic ActA-Lm strain . We compared serum cytokines between mice infected with ActA-Lm-OVA alone versus in combination with increasing numbers of LLO-Lm-OVA . Infection with combinations of LLO-Lm-OVA and ActA-Lm-OVA led to the dose-dependent reduction of serum IFN-γ , IL-12p70 , IL-6 and MCP-1 relative to ActA-Lm-OVA alone ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , LLO-Lm-OVA bacteria within a phagosome exert a negative effect on the pro-inflammatory response elicited by ActA-Lm-OVA within the cytosol . Because many vacuolar pathogens elicit a Th2-type cytokine profile [37] , we questioned the ability of LLO-Lm-OVA to elicit cytokines that might limit the potency of the adaptive T cell response . Four hours post infection , serum IL-10 was detectable in mice immunized with LLO-Lm-OVA , either alone or in combination with ActA-Lm-OVA , and required the adapter protein MyD88 ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , we detected high levels of IL-12p40 in the absence of heterodimeric IL-12p70 , suggesting high levels of IL-12p40 homodimer were present in the serum ( although we cannot rule out that p40 was complexed with p19 as functional IL-23 ) . Thus , the addition of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA to an inoculum of ActA-Lm-OVA inhibits inflammatory cytokine production and corresponds with elevated levels of IL-10 . To examine the role of IL-10 in limiting the potency of the adaptive response to LLO-Lm-OVA , mice were infected with ActA-Lm-OVA and LLO-Lm-OVA in combination with an antagonist IL-10 receptor antibody ( anti-IL-10R ) [38] . This regimen permits blockade of IL-10 signalling during priming while maintaining an intact immune system during challenge . Only the highest dose of LLO-Lm-OVA was used in combination with ActA-Lm-OVA , a combination that led to the greatest suppression of inflammatory cytokines and protective immunity ( Figures 1–4 ) . On day 30 , mice were challenged with wild-type-L . monocytogenes-OVA and protective immunity assessed 3 days later . Impressively , mice co-infected with LLO-Lm-OVA and ActA-Lm-OVA in the presence of IL-10R blockade demonstrated equivalent protection against wt-L . monocytogenes-OVA challenge as anti-IL-10R treated mice infected with ActA-Lm-OVA alone ( Figure 5A ) . IL-10 production following LLO-Lm infection was MyD88-dependent; therefore we questioned whether LLO-Lm would limit ActA-Lm-induced protective immunity in mice lacking MyD88 . Similar to the results following IL-10R blockade , MyD88−/−mice immunized with the combination of ActA-Lm-OVA and LLO-Lm-OVA were protected against a lethal challenge with wt L . monocytogenes ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , in the absence of MyD88 signalling , the ability of phagosome-confined L . monocytogenes to limit the adaptive response to L . monocytogenes within the cytosol is eliminated . Together , these results demonstrate that the innate immune system discriminates between pathogens that reside in distinct subcellular locations , and via a MyD88- and IL-10-dependent mechanism , impacts the potency of the adaptive immune response .
How the immune system differentiates between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes and translates this information into an appropriate immune response is not completely understood . Previous reports have shown that intracellular bacteria , including L . monocytogenes , activate a unique host cytosolic surveillance pathway of innate immunity while extracellular bacteria do not [9] , [16] , [39] , [40] . These studies led to our original hypothesis that activation of the host cytosolic surveillance pathway provided an explanation to the observations that heat-killed and LLO- L . monocytogenes fail to immunize mice to subsequent challenge [8] , [41] . Our original goal in these studies was to improve the potency of CD8 T cells responding to phagosome-confined LLO-Lm-OVA by complementing it with a cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain . Surprisingly , we found that the presence of phagosome-confined LLO-Lm negated the innate response to the cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain and ultimately compromised long-lived protective immunity ( Figure 1 ) . These results suggest that although recognition of microbial constituents within the cytosol may elicit cytokines that improve the cellular immune response , it is the exit from the phagosome that permits this inflammatory response to take place . Our data indicate that the potency of the adaptive T cell response is incrementally altered as the ratio of intracellular to phagosome-confined bacteria changes . Both ActA-Lm and LLO-Lm are similarly distributed amongst phagocytic cells in vivo [42] . Furthermore , because ActA-Lm cannot polymerize host-cell actin , neither strain will spread into neighbouring cells [43] . Thus the ratio of ActA-Lm to LLO-Lm will not alter the cell types that interact with the bacteria . To avoid overwhelming the innate immune system with L . monocytogenes , we decreased the dose of ActA-Lm to 1×105 CFU ( from the standard 0 . 1×LD50 dose of 1×107 CFU ) then added 10–1000-fold of LLO-Lm to the inoculum . Using these doses , the input CFU exceeded 1×107 CFU in only the highest dose group ( 1×105 CFU ActA-Lm+1×108 CFU LLO-Lm ) . Therefore , the loss of protective immunity observed following infection with 1×106 and 1×107 total CFU could not be explained by the increase in total CFU alone , as 1×107 CFU of ActA-Lm has been shown many times to elicit complete protective immunity to wild-type challenge [34] , [44] . The innate response to infection plays a pivotal role in shaping the adaptive immune response [29] . Suppression of cytokines and chemokines following recognition of microbial PRRs could impact the adaptive response via multiple mechanisms [45] . Chemokines produced at the site of infection facilitate the infiltration of neutrophils , macrophages and dendritic cells to the affected tissues [3] , [25] . Neutrophils and activated macrophages are critical for controlling bacterial replication , while dendritic cells are required for processing and presentation of microbial peptides [46] . Dendritic cells presenting bacterial antigens undergo maturation in response to proinflammatory cytokines . This maturation step is critical for modifying many aspects of dendritic cell function , including: the expression of specific proteasome subunits and thus , the repertoire of peptides available for presentation [47] , [48]; the density of MHC and co-stimulatory molecules on the cell surface [49]; and secretion of chemoattractants which recruit naïve T cells into the secondary lymphatics . In addition , inflammatory cytokines can act via direct co-stimulation of T cells during priming [50] . Thus , by virtue of its inability to escape from the phagosome , LLO-Lm alters the innate inflammatory landscape and ultimately , the potency of the Listeria-specific T cell response . The impact of cytokines on T cell potency is complex , as the effect of a specific cytokine can be dependent on location , context , and concentration . In previous studies , IL-10 was necessary for optimal T cell memory following L . monocytogenes infection [28] . However , elimination of IL-10 signalling from only CD8 T cells improved the magnitude and function of the response [26] . In agreement , when mice were immunized with ActA-Lm during IL-10R blockade , a small but reproducible increase in liver and spleen cfu was observed after wild-type challenge ( Figure 5A ) . Conversely , when the IL-10 receptor was blocked during immunization with LLO-Lm-OVA , protective immunity improved , resulting in 2–3 logs fewer CFU following lethal challenge . While IL-10 was detectable in low , but reproducible amounts following immunization with LLO-Lm-OVA , we were unable to measure IL-10 following immunization with ActA-Lm ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , serum IL-10 was only consistently detectable using the highest dose of LLO-Lm , 1×108 CFU . Measuring serum IL-10 in the presence of IL-10R blockade prevents IL-10 uptake and greatly improves the sensitivity of this assay . This approach increased serum IL-10 following LLO-Lm-OVA immunization 5–10-fold , while IL-10 in ActA-Lm immunized mice remained undetectable ( data not shown ) . Thus , while IL-10 certainly impacts T cell potency following infection with wild-type- or ActA-Lm , its concentration is far below that measured after immunization with LLO-Lm-OVA . When assessing the role of IL-10R signalling on the suppression of memory T cell function , we chose to use the highest dose of LLO-Lm ( 1×108 CFU ) in combination with 1×105 CFU ActA-Lm . This dose combination , which provided the most consistent levels of serum IL-10 , also provided the greatest amount of suppression ( Fig 1–3 ) . Thus , while we demonstrated suppression of the T cell response by a 1000-fold range of LLO-Lm , the highest and most inhibitory dose was chosen to assess the dependence on IL-10R signalling . The biological activity of these low concentrations of IL-10 suggest that its effects are locally restricted , requiring only minute concentrations but within a defined location . One possibility is that as the concentration of systemic IL-10 increases , its impact on the T cell response changes from positive to negative regulator . This functional switch might be attributed to differences in sensitivity to IL-10 , or other cytokines produced within the same microenvironment . These studies suggest that during L . monocytogenes infection , IL-10 acts as a negative regulator of T cell potency in CD8 T cells , while acting as a positive regulator of cellular immunity via its effects on other cell types . The results from these studies are significant both to the fields of microbial pathogenesis and vaccinology . Understanding how microbes interact with the innate and adaptive immune system is critical for controlling their pathogenic effects . Vaccines remain one of the most cost-effective tools for preventing disease and improving health worldwide . While vaccines that elicit humoral immunity have been relatively straightforward to develop , vaccines intended to elicit robust cellular immunity , such as those needed to combat HIV and tuberculosis , have remained elusive [51] . These difficulties may be in part due to our poor understanding of how the adaptive immune response is regulated [52] . Modern approaches to developing these vaccines have used killed or attenuated forms of otherwise pathogenic organisms in hopes of eliciting the appropriate immune response without overt disease [53] . Upon observing an inadequate immune response , a common next step is to add an adjuvant to the vaccine to improve its immunogenicity , or to explain its impotence as a lack of positive inflammatory signals [54] . Our studies show that recognition of microbial products within defined cellular compartments can negate inflammation and limit the potency of the cellular immune response even when numerous proinflammatory signals are present . This result may explain why the addition of adjuvants to safe but ineffective vaccines intended to elicit cellular immunity is often unsuccessful . Furthermore , these studies add to the emerging field of microbial subversion of innate and cellular immunity and serve as a primer for defining new regulatory signalling pathways [55] . These studies shed new light on the classic observation that only microbes entering the host cell cytosol lead to a productive antigen-specific CD8 T cell response . It is not simply a case of inefficient antigen processing and presentation or the inability to activate the cytosolic surveillance pathway; the innate immune response to bacteria residing within a phagosome negates the innate and adaptive response to otherwise stimulatory bacterial products . Additional experiments are required to define the exact receptor-ligand interactions that take place within a phagosome , as well as to identify other cytokines and chemokines that may impact inflammation and T cell potency in this scenario . Understanding these negative regulatory pathways will be pivotal for the rational design of safe and potent vaccines that elicit long-lived T cell-mediated immunity .

Chiles Research Institute , University of California , Berkeley or the Anza Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . 6–10 week old C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories ( Wilmington , MA ) . B6 . MyD88−/− mice were bred at our facilities . L . monocytogenes strains ActA-Lm-OVA and LLO-Lm-OVA were constructed as previously described [8] . Both strains secrete full-length chicken ovalbumin fused to the first 441 amino acids of LLO and controlled by the hly promoter .

Bacteria were grown to midlog in brain-heart infusion broth , washed in PBS , then injected intravenously in 200 µL total volume . Mice were injected intravenously with 250 µg anti-IL-10R ( CD210 , clone 1B1 . 3a , BD Bioscience , San Diego , CA ) 2 hours before L . monocytogenes infection . Mice infected 30 or 60 days prior were challenged with 2×LD50 ( 1×105 CFU ) wild-type L . monocytogenes-OVA ( L4056-OVA ) . 3 days later , spleens and livers were homogenized and serial dilutions plated on BHI-strep agar plates for enumeration . Experiments using ActA-Lm-ErmR were plated in duplicate using BHI-strep and BHI-strep-erm agar . In vitro growth was determined in bone-marrow derived macrophages adhered to coverslips at the indicated timepoints . Coverslips were vortexed in lysis buffer and plated on strep-erm agar to enumerate ActA-Lm-ErmR bacteria . Spleens were harvested , dissociated , and red blood cells removed by ammonium chloride lysis buffer ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Following 5 hours of restimulation with the relevant peptide in the presence of brefeldin A , cells were stained with anti-CD4 ( clone GK1 . 5 , eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) and anti-CD8 ( clone 53-6 . 7 , BD Biosciences ) , then fixed , permeabilized and stained for intracellular IFN-γ . ( clone XMG1 . 2 , eBioscience ) [8] . Pentamer staining was performed using Kb-OVA257–264 pentamers conjugated to APC ( ProImmune Ltd , Bradenton , FL ) . Data was acquired on a FACSCanto flow cytometer ( BD Bioscience ) and analyzed using FlowJo software ( Treestar , Ashland , OR ) . Serum was analyzed using the CBA Mouse Inflammation Kit ( BD Biosciences ) and FACSCanto flow cytometer ( IL-10 , IFN-γ , MCP-1 , IL-6 , IL-12p70 ) , and the LincoPlex Multiplex Assay ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) and Luminex 100 instrument ( IL-12p40 ) . Time points of 4 and 24 hours post infection were chosen as the peaks of the early and late cytokine response , determined during a kinetic analysis of cytokine production [57] .","Little is understood about how the immune system distinguishes between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes . Limiting or preventing infections by intracellular pathogens requires the activation of innate immunity and the consequent generation of effector and memory T cells , which recognize and kill infected cells . Investigators are currently testing attenuated versions of pathogenic microbes as vaccines in an attempt to generate pathogen-specific T cells without causing disease . Unfortunately , attenuated microbes often fail to elicit long-lived protective immunity . We hypothesized that attenuated bacterial vaccines do not immunize because they fail to activate a stimulatory arm of host innate immune receptors . However , we found that these attenuated bacterial vaccines are not simply prevented from activating immunity , but rather generate a negative signal that inhibits the desired immune response . These studies may explain why the addition of an adjuvant to ineffective vaccines does not necessarily improve immunogenicity . Furthermore , these studies provide a framework for the development of attenuated vaccines that do not inhibit the desired immune responses .",['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Methods'],"['microbiology/cellular' 'microbiology' 'and' 'pathogenesis'

6,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide . Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is the most common subtype and is a complex trait with multigenic inheritance . Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus ( rs10483727 , odds ratio ( OR ) = 1 . 32 , p = 3 . 87×10−11 ) . SIX6 plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve . We sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants , including five rare and one common variant , Asn141His ( rs33912345 ) , which was associated significantly with POAG ( OR = 1 . 27 , p = 4 . 2×10−10 ) in the NEIGHBOR/GLAUGEN datasets . These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio ( zebrafish ) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure . Five variants , found primarily in POAG cases , were hypomorphic or null , while the sixth variant , found only in controls , was benign . One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation . Finally , to our knowledge for the first time , we have identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele ( His141 ) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele ( Asn141 ) . Our results , in combination with previous SIX6 work , lead us to hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina , leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells , thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss .
Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is the most common type of glaucoma , a group of diseases that affect approximately 60 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of blindness [1] . Glaucoma is characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells , leading to optic nerve atrophy and loss of vision . POAG is a complex inherited disorder for which an increasing number of genetic associations have been described , each contributing modestly to disease burden [2] , [3] . A recent POAG genome-wide association study found a significant genetic association ( rs10483727 , odds ratio ( OR ) = 1 . 32 , p = 3 . 87×10−11 ) at the SIX1/SIX6 locus [4] . Variants in the SIX1/SIX6 locus were first associated with quantitative optic nerve parameters in controls , including vertical cup-disc ratio ( VCDR ) , which is used clinically to diagnose and monitor POAG progression [5] , [6] . Several studies have independently confirmed the association of the SIX1/SIX6 locus with both VCDR and POAG [7]–[9] . The human SIX gene family consists of six members ( SIX1–SIX6 ) , all of which contain two shared protein domains; a DNA binding homeobox domain and a SIX domain , which binds downstream effector molecules [10] , [11] . Members of this conserved gene family were originally identified through homology to the Drosophila melanogaster ( Drosophila ) sine oculis ( so ) gene , which is required for proper eye development [10] , [11] and are thought to function as transcription factors , regulating key developmental steps through a complex regulatory network . During embryonic development , SIX1 is expressed broadly in multiple tissues , including the otic vesicle and the limb mesenchyme . However , expression of SIX6 is restricted to regions of the retina and the pituitary [10] , [12] . Drosophila with null so alleles have restricted retinal development , while morpholino knockdown of six6b in Danio rerio ( zebrafish ) embryos was recently shown to result in a small eye phenotype [10] , [13] . In humans , a large deletion on chromosome 14q22 . 3-q23 that includes SIX6 causes bilateral anophthalmia , the absence of both eyes , demonstrating the importance of SIX gene family members in ocular development and human disease [10] , [11] , [14]–[16] . In this study , we have extended the current understanding of the molecular contributions of SIX6 to POAG risk . First , we identified potential POAG risk alleles by sequencing the SIX6 gene in a case-control dataset; we found both common and rare coding changes within SIX6 in POAG cases , as well as sequence variants in the SIX6 enhancer . We then used the zebrafish system to demonstrate that these human coding variants have functional consequences in eye development . This analysis of 2–3 day old zebrafish embryos is not intended to fully recapitulate the glaucomatous phenotype; however , it provides in vivo data about the functional effects of human genetic variation on the human SIX6 protein in the context of eye development . We next used luciferase reporter assays , through which we show that a sequence variant found in the SIX6 enhancer of POAG patients may increase SIX6 expression . Finally , we demonstrate that POAG cases homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele rs33912345 have a significantly thinner retinal nerve fiber layer , suggesting a glaucomatous pathogenic mechanism driven by SIX6 dysfunction .
Sequencing of the SIX1 and SIX6 genes in Caucasian POAG cases and controls ( 262 cases , 256 controls ) revealed 23 SNPs ( Supplemental Table S1 ) . Nine SNPs were identified in SIX1 , but no nonsynonymous SNPs were present in the POAG cases . Sequencing of SIX6 yielded 14 variants including five rare nonsynonymous SNPs in POAG cases and controls , one common nonsynonymous SNP located in the homeobox of SIX6 ( rs33912345 , Asn141His ) , and five sequence variants within the SIX6 enhancer . All of these variants are conserved evolutionarily as shown by their positive Genomic Evolution Rate Profiling ( GERP ) scores ( Table 1 ) [17] . Genotyping of rs33912345 in the Duke POAG case-control dataset ( 482 cases , 433 controls ) resulted in a significant association ( OR = 1 . 40 , p = 0 . 0005 , POAG case minor allele frequency ( MAF ) = 0 . 47 , POAG control MAF = 0 . 38 ) with POAG . This SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium ( r2 = 0 . 95 ) with the intergenic SNP identified originally in POAG and VCDR genome-wide association studies ( rs10483727 ) [4]–[6] , [13] . As expected , meta-analysis of the imputed genotype data from the NEIGHBOR and GLAUGEN studies confirmed a significant association between POAG status and rs33912345 ( OR = 1 . 27 , p = 4 . 2×10−10 ) and other linked SNPs in the region ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . Further examination of this locus showed that the association signal includes both upstream and downstream regions of the SIX6 transcript , while remaining entirely downstream of SIX1 ( Supplemental 1 ) . We next performed optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) to study the retinal characteristics of POAG cases possessing the SIX6 risk and non-risk variants ( Table 2 ) . OCT images were only available for POAG cases with the common SNP , rs33912345; no data were available for individuals with the rare SIX6 variants . We assessed retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thickness in thirty POAG cases homozygous for the rs33912345 risk allele ( C ) or the non-risk allele ( A ) first by comparing age at disease diagnosis and age at OCT across the two genotypes , because age is known to influence retinal thickness and is thus a potential confounder . We observed no significant difference in age ( p = 0 . 11 , p = 0 . 14 , respectively ) . Next , RNFL thickness was evaluated . The overall thickness ( global RNFL ) was reduced significantly in cases homozygous for the risk allele compared to cases with the non-risk allele ( p = 0 . 03; mean ( SD ) : C = 58 . 3 ( 8 . 2 ) µm , A = 67 . 9 ( 12 . 4 ) µm; Table 2 ) , consistent with the hypothesis that SIX6 may increase POAG susceptibility via changes in the neural retina . To determine which quadrants might be driving this observation , we performed an exploratory , post-hoc comparison of RNFL thickness in the temporal , nasal , inferior , and superior regions . We found that RNFL thickness was reduced significantly in the inferior ( p = 0 . 03 ) and superior ( p = 0 . 04 ) quadrants , the two regions affecting directly VCDR measurements . Given 1 ) the observed association signal pattern; 2 ) the lack of coding changes identified in SIX1; 3 ) the presence of rare missense variants and a common , associated missense SNP in SIX6; 4 ) retinal nerve fiber layer thickness changes observed in POAG cases homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele; and 5 ) the localized expression of SIX6 in ocular tissues , we concluded SIX6 is a likely candidate gene in this region . We therefore evaluated the functional relevance of SIX6 and the potential burden of common and rare alleles in this locus in POAG using an in vivo zebrafish complementation assay . First , we performed a reciprocal BLAST analysis; we identified two orthologs of SIX6 in the zebrafish genome , Six6a and Six6b , both with 91% homology at the protein level ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Previous overexpression and loss of function studies of Six6 in Mus musculus ( mouse ) and Xenopus laevis ( Xenopus ) models reveal a role in regulating the proliferative state of retinal progenitor cells and the size of the eye [18] , [19]; therefore , as a first test of whether the identified SIX6 variants are pathogenic and potentially relevant to POAG , we asked whether 1 ) morpholino-induced suppression of six6a or six6b leads to a reduced eye size; 2 ) expression of the human SIX6 non-risk allele rescues the morphant eye phenotype; and 3 ) expression of SIX6 alleles containing POAG risk variants rescues the morphant eye phenotype . Using translation-blocking morpholinos ( MOs ) targeting zebrafish six6a and six6b , we injected 1–8 cell stage embryos ( N = 50–150 ) and analyzed live embryos at 3 days post fertilization ( dpf ) . We also tested a splice blocking MO . However , this induced non-specific toxicity , including the accumulation of pericardial fluid that could not be rescued with the human SIX6 transcript . This is not unexpected , as SIX6 is a two exon gene—splice-blocking MOs are generally not recommended for two exon genes; the targeted transcript will not be subject to nonsense mediated decay , possibly leading to the expression of a truncated protein and potential dominant-negative effects ( described by the manufacturer: http://www . gene-tools . com/node/18 ) . For these reasons , we used translation-blocking MOs for the remainder of our experiments . Masked scoring of both six6a and six6b morphants revealed ocular phenotypes consistent with loss of function , including a reduction in eye size in more than 80% of embryos ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1 ) . The specificity of the MO was tested by co-injection of 12 . 5 pg of the human SIX6 non-risk allele mRNA; we observed significant ( p<0 . 001 ) rescue in six6a but not six6b morphant embryos ( 90% vs . 10% of embryos , respectively ) . Together , these data indicate that Six6a is the functional ortholog of human SIX6 and prompted subsequent evaluation of SIX6 variants using the six6a MO . To investigate the pathogenic potential of all SIX6 variants , we used total eye size and the rescue of the morphant phenotype as the assay's phenotypic readout . We injected a mixture containing six6a MO and each of the human SIX6 alleles containing the coding variants identified via sequencing ( Table 1 ) . Subsequent to triplicate injections and masked scoring , these results were compared to the rescue condition of the human SIX6 non-risk allele . We found that five of the six variants tested were unable to fully rescue the small eye phenotype . Four of these alleles ( Glu129Lys , Asn141His , Thr212Met , and Ser242Ile ) resulted in an average eye size larger than the morpholino alone ( p<0 . 001 ) , but smaller than the rescue with the non-risk allele ( p<0 . 001 ) , indicating that these alleles are hypomorphic ( Figure 2 , Table 3 ) . We also observed one variant ( Leu205Arg ) with an average eye size smaller than the morpholino alone ( p = 0 . 002; mean ( SD ) : MO = 34 , 042 ( 5 , 763 ) µm2 , Leu205Arg = 31 , 568 ( 6 , 485 ) µm2; Figure 2 ) , suggesting that it is functionally null . Finally , one allele ( Glu93Gln ) resulted in an eye size similar to the rescue with the non-risk allele ( p = 0 . 37 ) and was determined to be benign . The benign allele was identified in one control individual , while the remaining hypomorphic and null alleles were identified either exclusively or primarily in POAG cases ( Table 1 ) . Injection of 12 . 5 pg of the human SIX6 risk mRNA into non-morphant zebrafish provided no evidence of a toxic gain of function compared to injection with the non-risk allele ( data not shown ) . Given the reduction of the RNFL in cases homozygous for the risk allele , we next asked whether six6a and the identified SIX6 variants impacted the optic nerve , an anatomical site directly relevant to human POAG , in zebrafish . Using whole mount imaging of acetylated-tubulin expression in 2-dpf embryos injected with a control and six6a morpholino , we evaluated volumetric regions of interest ( ROI ) along the optic nerve ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . Masked scoring of embryos revealed an approximately 3 fold reduction ( p<0 . 001 ) in the volume of the optic nerve upon depletion of six6a ( Figure 3 A–B ) . This was specific for the optic nerve as the volume of other axonal tracts in the brain were unaffected by six6a depletion ( Figure 3A ) . Specificity of the volumetric measurements was demonstrated upon full rescue of the six6a morphant phenotype by co-injection of the non-risk allele ( p<0 . 001 ) or a variant that scored as a benign allele in the eye size assay ( Glu93Gln; p<0 . 001; Figure 3B ) . Both Leu205Arg and Asn141His variants performed as hypomorphic alleles ( p<0 . 01 ) , revealing concordance of our optic nerve assay with the OCT imaging findings in patients . We hypothesized that POAG risk may be mediated not only by deficits in SIX6 protein function , but also by the level of SIX6 gene expression . To test this , we sequenced the SIX6 retinal specific enhancer element in 262 POAG cases and 256 POAG controls; we identified five variants ( Chr14:60974363_C , Chr14:60974373_T , Chr14:60974378_T , Chr14:60974400_A , Chr14:60974449_G ) ( Table 1 ) , and tested their effect on expression using an in vitro luciferase assay . We found that one of these variants ( Chr14:60974449_G ) resulted in a significant increase in expression compared to the reference enhancer ( Figure 4 ) . Activation of the SIX6 enhancer requires two cofactors , NeuroD and E47 ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) [12] . Overexpression was observed with the Chr14:60974449_G variant even in the absence of these cofactors ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) , suggesting variants within the enhancer region may result in dysregulated protein expression .
The SIX1/SIX6 locus has been shown to be associated significantly with POAG in several independent studies; however , the causal variant ( s ) driving this association have remained unknown [4] , [6]–[9] , [13] , as has the direction of effect of these common alleles on protein function . We have demonstrated through several lines of evidence—the tissue specificity of the SIX gene family described in the literature; the identification of SIX6 missense variants in our POAG dataset; and the results of the in vivo and in vitro assays— that SIX6 is the most likely POAG susceptibility gene in this region . We identified both common and rare coding variants that alter the function of the SIX6 protein . We also identified a novel variant within the SIX6 enhancer that appears to disrupt the regulation of SIX6 expression , suggesting both regulatory and coding variants may influence POAG susceptibility at this locus . Finally , we identified hitherto unknown clinical features in POAG patients that may be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele have a significantly thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele . The common variant , rs33912345 ( Asn141His ) , which we showed has significantly reduced function in an in vivo model , was associated with POAG in our dataset and is in strong linkage disequilibrium with the originally identified GWAS SNP , rs10483727 [4] . This conserved amino acid is located within the alpha helix structure of the DNA homeobox domain of SIX6 . Interestingly , the ancestral allele ( C , His ) is associated with POAG risk . The allele frequency of this variant differs markedly among populations ( C allele frequency: YRI ( 0 . 99 ) , ARF ( 0 . 96 ) , ASN ( 0 . 76 ) , and CEU ( 0 . 42 ) ; from 1000 Genomes release 14 ) [20] . This locus is associated significantly with an increase in vertical cup-disc ratio ( VCDR ) in population controls , indicating that it may be involved in the development of the optic nerve . VCDR is also a clinical measure used to track disease progression in POAG patients [5] , [6] , [9] , [13] , [21] . We note that African populations have larger VCDR and an increase in overall POAG prevalence [22]–[24] compared to CEU populations; in a recent study , the prevalence of POAG in Ghana exceeded 17% , the highest rate observed anywhere in the world [25] . While rs33912345 is not associated with POAG risk in a West African POAG case/control dataset from Ghana , the frequency of the ancestral ( risk ) allele is 99% in both cases and controls [26] . We hypothesize that differences in the structure of the optic nerve and the higher risk of POAG in individuals with African ancestry may , in part , arise from the fact that essentially all individuals in this population are homozygous for the rs33912345 ancestral risk allele . Given the association of the SIX6 locus with neural retinal measurements such as VCDR , it is reasonable to hypothesize causal variants may function by inducing quantitative changes in cell populations in the retina . There is extensive evidence that SIX6 regulates early retinal progenitor cell proliferation during eye development [18] , [19] , [27] . Li et al . showed that Six6−/− mice display varying degrees of retinal hypoplasia that is due to a decrease in retinal ganglion cell proliferation arising from an early exit from the cell cycle during development , and results in a 20% decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cells by P35 [18] . This is consistent with functional studies of XOptx2 , the Xenopus ortholog of SIX6 [19] . We have shown a reduction in eye size and in the volume of the optic nerve upon MO knockdown of zebrafish six6a , and we were able to rescue these phenotypes with co-injection of the human SIX6 non-risk allele , demonstrating that the zebrafish six6a gene is the likely functional ortholog to human SIX6 . We identified five alleles that could not rescue the small eye and optic nerve phenotypes , and we observed a reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in POAG patients homozygous for the His141 SIX6 risk allele . Taken together with previously published findings , our results suggest that risk variants in human SIX6 increase POAG susceptibility by negatively affecting retinal ganglion cell development , likely leading to a reduction in the number of retinal ganglion cells in adulthood . Given that retinal ganglion cells are lost during the normal aging process , we speculate that this rate of loss could be increased by the presence of additional POAG risk alleles or other risk factors such as increased intraocular pressure [28] . The development of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and associated visual field loss would thus be hastened by a reduction in the initial number of retinal ganglion cells that an individual possesses . Future work will test the possibility that SIX6 variants also alter the rate of RGC death in the adult . In summary , we have identified multiple common and rare SIX6 sequence variants in POAG cases , and used in vivo and in vitro assays to demonstrate that these variants have functional consequences on SIX6 expression and protein function . While other risk factors may be required for the onset of POAG , our data suggest that attenuation of SIX6 protein function increases an individual's susceptibility to developing the disease via changes to retinal development . Additional work is needed , possibly through the use of transgenic animal model studies , to fully understand the role of SIX6 in POAG .
This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Duke University Medical Center and adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Study subjects were unrelated patients from the Duke Eye Center and , after a comprehensive eye examine , were classified as either POAG cases or controls . POAG cases presented with glaucomatous optic neuropathy , defined as a cup-to-disc ratio greater than 0 . 7 and visual field loss in at least one eye . Patients with secondary forms of glaucoma or a history of ocular trauma were excluded from the study . POAG controls had no evidence of optic neuropathy , normal intraocular pressure ( less than 22 mmHg in both eyes ) , and normal visual fields , assessed using standard automated perimetry . Genomic DNA was extracted from patient blood samples using the PureGene chemistry following the manufacturer's standard protocol ( Gentra , Minneapolis , MN ) . The coding portions ( 2 exons ) of the SIX1 and SIX6 genes were sequenced in 518 Caucasian POAG cases and controls ( 262 cases , 256 controls ) using a polymerase chain-reaction ( PCR ) containing 1× Qiagen PCR buffer ( Tris·Cl , KCl , ( NH4 ) 2SO4 , 15 mM MgCl2; pH 8 . 7 ) ; 200 µM each of dATP , dCTP , dGTP , and dTTP; 0 . 4 µM forward PCR primer; 0 . 4 µM reverse PCR primer; 3 µL of betaine , 10 ng genomic DNA; and 0 . 5 U HotStarTaq DNA polymerase ( Qiagen , Venlo , Limburg ) to a final volume of 25 µL . Primer sequences are available in Supplemental Table S3 . The PCR was performed using a touchdown protocol ( incremental lowering of annealing temperature ) using the following thermocycler conditions: 94°C for 30 s , 65°C for 30 s , 72°C for 30 s with a 2°C decrease in the annealing temperature every two cycles until a final annealing temperature of 55°C was reached . The retinal specific SIX6 enhancer , previously described [12] , was amplified a using a touchdown protocol with a final annealing temperature of 57°C . PCR products were sequencing using the BigDye chemistry on a 3730 DNA Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems , Grand Island , NY ) . The common missense single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) , rs33912345 , was genotyped in the Duke POAG case-control dataset consisting of 482 POAG cases and 433 POAG controls using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay according to the standard protocols from the manufacturer ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . For quality control purposes the following criteria were met: >95% genotyping efficiency , matching sample duplicates ( two Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain samples per 96-well plate whose genotype data matched across all plates ) , and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium assumptions . We tested for association of rs33912345 with POAG using an additive logistic regression model adjusted for age and sex using SAS [29] . Genome-wide genotype data were available from the NEI Glaucoma Human Genetics Collaboration ( NEIGHBOR ) and the Glaucoma Genes and Environment ( GLAUGEN ) consortia [4] . Chromosome 14 was imputed using IMPUTE2 ( http://mathgen . stats . ox . ac . uk/impute/impute_v2 . html ) with a global 1000 Genomes reference panel . We tested SNPs at the SIX1/SIX6 locus for association with POAG using an additive logistic regression model adjusted for age , sex , and four principal components ( NEIGHBOR ) or age , gender , study site , DNA extraction method , DNA specimen type and principal components 1–6 ( GLAUGEN ) implemented in PLINK and visualized using LocusZoom ( http://csg . sph . umich . edu/locuszoom/ ) [30] , [31] . A meta-analysis was performed in Plink using a random effects model . Linkage disequilibrium was calculated and visualized using Haploview ( http://www . broadinstitute . org/scientific-community/science/programs/medical-and-population-genetics/haploview/haploview ) [32] . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) by Spectralis ( Heidelberg Engineering , Carlsbad , CA ) spectral domain ) and fundus photography were available from the Duke Eye Center . OCT images are not routinely performed in patients without ocular disease , so there was limited data available for controls . Therefore , the analysis was restricted to POAG cases homozygous for rs33912345 . Thirty patients had both OCT measurements and SIX6 genotype data . RNFL thickness , age at POAG diagnosis , and the age at OCT measurement were compared between individuals homozygous for the risk or non-risk allele using a Student's t-test . Analyses were performed in SAS [29] . A vector containing human SIX6 was purchased from the CCSB Human ORFeome Collection that uses the Gateway technology system ( Open Biosystems and Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . SIX6 alleles identified by sequencing ( Glu93Gln , Glu129Lys , Asn141His , Leu205Arg , Thr212Met , Ser242IIe ) , were created using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit and protocols provided by the manufacturer ( Agilent Technologies ) . SIX6 mRNA was in vitro transcribed using mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit ( Ambion , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . Translation blocker ( TB ) morpholinos against six6a ( 5′- CTGGAACATGGAGACTGTAATGTCT -3′ ) and six6b ( 5′ AATTGGCAACTGAAACATGAAGGCT 3′ ) were purchased from Gene Tools , LLC . Morpholino ( 2 ng ) and mRNA ( 12 . 5 pg ) were mixed and a volume of 0 . 5 nL was microinjected into each wild-type zebrafish embryo at one- to eight-cell stage as described previously ( Stuart , McMurray et al . 1988 ) . Morphometric analyses of eye size were conducted on zebrafish embryos at 3 days post fertilization , using a Nikon SMZ 745T microscope . Zebrafish were anesthetized in embryo medium containing 0 . 2 mg/ml tricaine ( Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate , Sigma , E10521 ) . Lateral view images were captured with Nikon DS-Fi1 camera , and the size of eye was measured with Nikon NIS-Elements AR software . Analysis of the optic nerve was performed on 2 dpf embryos fixed in Dent's fixative ( 80% Methanol and 20% DMSO ) overnight and stained with acetylated-tubulin ( Sigma; T7451 ) . Heads were isolated from stained embryos and oriented with the ventral aspect facing a coverslip on microscope cover glass . Image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss 710 inverted confocal microscope and ∼100 um optical sections were obtained and reconstructed . Volumetric measurements were calculated using Imaris software and 7 . 5 um×7 . 5 um×15 um ROIs along the optic nerve were analyzed between each condition . ROIs were restricted to portions of the optic nerve wherein all neurite processes coalesced to form the major aspect of the nerve . SIX6 enhancer alleles were tested using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . An experimental construct containing a minimal promoter ( pGL4 . 23 , firefly luciferase , Promega ) was used to test the functional effect of the enhancer alleles identified by sequencing ( Chr14:60974363_C , Chr14:60974373_T , Chr14:60974378_T , Chr14:60974400_A , Chr14:60974449_G ) in the POAG case/control dataset . The experimental constructs ( pGL4 . 23+Enhancer ) were generated using a nested PCR protocol; the XhoI and HindII enzymes; the Quick Ligation kit ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) ; and the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Technologies ) , following protocols provided by the manufacturers . Constructs were confirmed to be correct by sequencing . Hek293 cells were cultured according to the supplier's suggestions ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . As described by Conte et al . , co-transfection with NeuroD and E47 is required for SIX6 enhancer activation [12] . Therefore , cells were co-transfected with an experimental vector ( pGL4 . 23+Enhancer ) , a control vector ( pGL4 . 74 , renilla luciferase , Promega ) , and vectors containing NeuroD and E47 ( provided by the Center for Human Disease Modeling , Duke University ) using a standard calcium phosphate transfection protocol . The experiment was performed three times in triplicate and the results were analyzed using the dual luciferase reporter ( DLR ) ratio ( firefly luciferase sum: renilla luciferase sum ) normalized by the reference SIX6 enhancer included on every plate . The data were analyzed using an ANOVA , adjusted for batch , and linear contrasts were used to determine the effect of each vector . Statistical analyses were performed in SAS [29] .","Primary open angle glaucoma is a blinding disease for which there is currently no cure , only treatments that may slow its progress . To help understand the mechanisms of this disease and to design more effective treatments , we identified previously a locus , SIX6 , that increases the risk of glaucoma . This gene is involved in early eye development and helps to form the retina . In this paper , we test specific sequence variants in SIX6 that are found in glaucoma patients . We show that these variants have a reduced function that interferes with their ability to direct proper formation of the retina . One variant in particular is common , and may be the main reason that this gene is important in the glaucoma disease process . Patients who have two copies of this sequence variant show a change in the structure of their eye consistent with fewer neurons that carry the visual signal to the brain . These neurons typically die as people age , and people who begin life with fewer visual neurons may have an increased risk of glaucoma . Additional research in this topic may lead to new treatments that preserve sight .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Materials' 'and'

7,"In the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile , flagella promote adherence to intestinal epithelial cells . Flagellar gene expression also indirectly impacts production of the glucosylating toxins , which are essential to diarrheal disease development . Thus , factors that regulate the expression of the flgB operon will likely impact toxin production in addition to flagellar motility . Here , we report the identification a “flagellar switch” that controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins . The flagellar switch , located upstream of the flgB operon containing the early stage flagellar genes , is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats . Bacteria with the sequence in one orientation expressed flagellum and toxin genes , produced flagella , and secreted the toxins ( “flg phase ON” ) . Bacteria with the sequence in the inverse orientation were attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression , were aflagellate , and showed decreased toxin secretion ( “flg phase OFF” ) . The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro . We provide evidence that gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a C . difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation . Lastly , through mutagenesis and characterization of flagellar phase locked isolates , we determined that the tyrosine recombinase RecV , which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch , is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions . Phase variable flagellar motility and toxin production suggests that these important virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during the course of infection .
Clostridium difficile , a Gram-positive , spore-forming obligate anaerobe , is the leading cause of nosocomial disease in the North America , Europe and Australia [1 , 2] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list C . difficile infections ( CDI ) as an urgent threat related to the use of antibiotics [3] . Antibiotic use perturbs the gastrointestinal microbiota that normally protects against CDI [1 , 4] . The rates of recurrence and mortality associated with CDI have increased in part due to the emergence of epidemic-associated strains with enhanced sporulation rates and toxin production [1 , 5 , 6] . The C . difficile PCR ribotype 027 group is associated with greater odds of diarrheal disease severity , outcome , and death compared to many other PCR ribotypes [7] . Therefore , an understanding of bacterial physiology and genetics in C . difficile 027 ribotypes could reveal unique therapeutic or diagnostic targets to ameliorate severe CDI . C . difficile is primarily transmitted as metabolically dormant spores , which germinate into actively growing vegetative cells in response to bile salts such as glycine-conjugated taurocholate [8–10] . CDI ranges in severity from mild self-limiting diarrhea to fulminant colitis characterized by neutrophil infiltration into the lamina propria , erosion of crypts and goblet cells , and extensive epithelial tissue damage . Diarrheal disease is associated with strains that produce the glucosylating toxins TcdA and/or TcdB [11 , 12] . Both TcdA and TcdB glucosylate Rho and Rac GTPases in host cells to promote actin depolymerization , destruction of tight junctions at the mucosal barrier , and inflammation [13–16] . The glucosylating toxins are necessary for diarrheal disease in both the mouse and hamster models of infection , with TcdB playing a more prominent role [11 , 12 , 17] . Colonization is a requisite step to diarrheal disease , and the bacterial surface structures , such as flagella , that participate in colonization are an active area of study . The flagellar apparatus confers motility and contributes to adherence , colonization , and disease in C . difficile [18–20] . Flagellum biosynthesis genes are conserved in most sequenced C . difficile strains [19 , 21] . As in other bacterial species , flagellar gene transcription occurs in a hierarchical order to ensure proper protein assembly and to conserve energy . The early stage flagellar operon contains genes for assembly of the basal body . SigD ( σD ) , the flagellar alternative sigma factor , is encoded in the early stage flagellar operon and activates the transcription of the late stage operons [22 , 23] . At least four operons contain late stage flagellar genes involved in assembly of the flagellar hook , filament , and cap , and for post-translational modification of the flagellar filament [18 , 22 , 24–26] . Flagellar arrangement is peritrichous in most strains [18 , 27–31] . The flagellar apparatus contributes to C . difficile fitness during gastrointestinal infection in a ribotype-dependent manner [20] . In C . difficile 630Δerm ( ribotype 012 ) , flagella are dispensable for adherence to cultured epithelial cells and colonization in the murine model [31 , 32] . In contrast , in the epidemic-associated C . difficile strain R20291 ( ribotype 027 ) , flagellar filaments promote adherence and colonization in vitro and during infection of mice [31] . Flagellar motility is not required for adherence in this strain , as a MotB mutant that produces flagellar filaments with a nonfunctional motor displays wild type adherence [31] . Interestingly , mice infected with the R20291 fliC mutant succumb to infection , whereas mice infected with the parental strain do not [31] . The R20291 fliC mutant has altered expression of genes involved in motility , membrane transport , sporulation , and metabolism in vitro [33] , which may explain the enhanced virulence in mice . Post-translational modification of flagella also contributes to colonization kinetics in a mouse relapse model of infection in M68 , an 017 ribotype strain [24] . In the hamster model , C . difficile 630Δerm strains with a mutation in several early stage flagellar genes showed reduced virulence , whereas C . difficile with mutations in the late stage flagellar genes fliC and fliD generally showed increased virulence [22 , 32] . Several groups have observed that a 630Δerm fliC mutant produces more toxin , which may contribute to the increased virulence of the mutant [22 , 31 , 32] . The animal model-dependent differences in virulence phenotypes of the flagellar gene mutants may be attributed to the greater sensitivity of hamsters to the glucosylating toxins [34] , and to higher spore germination rates of C . difficile spores in hamsters than in mice [35] . Notably , the expression of the glucosylating toxin genes is linked to flagellar gene expression in C . difficile [20 , 36] . TcdA and TcdB are encoded on a Pathogenicity Locus ( PaLoc ) along with the TcdR sigma factor that positively regulates tcdA and tcdB [37] , the anti-sigma factor TcdC suggested to inhibit TcdR function [38–41] , and the TcdE holin-like protein suggested to be involved in toxin export [42 , 43] . Preliminary studies suggested that σD affects the expression of the glucosylating toxin genes [22] . Subsequent work identified a σD consensus sequence in the tcdR promoter [23 , 44] . Overexpression of sigD in C . difficile increases toxin production in a TcdR-dependent manner [44] , and recombinant σD with RNA polymerase directly binds the tcdR promoter [23] . Taken together , these studies highlight a regulatory link between virulence factors critical to host colonization and to disease symptom development in C . difficile , similar to other diarrheal bacterial pathogens , such as Vibrio cholerae and Campylobacter jejuni [45 , 46] . C . difficile flagellin and the glucosylating toxins stimulate pathogen recognition receptors [47–49] , which promote pathogen clearance mechanisms , and therefore their production must be subject to precise regulation to avoid host recognition . In addition to σD , several transcriptional regulators modulate toxin production in C . difficile , potentially via regulation of flagellar gene expression . Spo0A , SigH , and RstA inhibit expression of the flagellar and toxin genes [50–53] , while Agr quorum sensing and Hfq are positive regulators [29 , 54] . The exact mechanisms by which these regulators control flagellar and toxin gene expression are largely unknown . Cyclic diguanylate ( c-di-GMP ) is a nucleotide second messenger that controls a multitude of bacterial processes , such as flagellar motility , biofilm formation , and virulence factor expression [55–58] . In C . difficile , c-di-GMP regulates swimming motility , cytopathicity , Type IV-pilus dependent surface motility and biofilm formation [30 , 44 , 59 , 60] . Specifically , elevated c-di-GMP inhibits flagellar gene expression and swimming motility [59] , and also negatively regulates toxin gene expression as a result of reduced sigD transcription [44] . Flagellar gene regulation occurs via a c-di-GMP sensing riboswitch , Cd1 , located in the 5’ untranslated region of the early stage flagellar operon [61] . c-di-GMP binding to Cd1 causes premature transcription termination , resulting in a truncated transcript of 160 nt of the 5’ untranslated region [62] . Here , we describe the identification and characterization of an additional cis-acting regulatory element that mediates phase variable expression of flagellar genes and , consequently , the toxin genes . We identified a flagellar switch consisting of 154 bp flanked by 21 bp imperfect inverted repeats , between the Cd1 riboswitch and the first open reading frame in the early stage flagellar operon . The orientation of the flagellar switch controls downstream flagellar gene expression , including sigD , and therefore production of flagella and swimming motility . Furthermore , the flagellar switch affects transcription of the toxin genes by way of σD , impacting the production of the glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C . difficile . We provide evidence that regulation through the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation . Lastly , we identified RecV , which also controls phase variation of the cell wall protein CwpV , as the recombinase responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions . Together these findings indicate that flagellar motility and the production of toxins are subject to phase variation in C . difficile , thus identifying an additional level of regulation of these linked processes . Flagellar and toxin phase variation in C . difficile may confer an advantage to the bacterium during infection of the gastrointestinal tract as a bet hedging strategy to either promote colonization and inflammation as certain tissue sites or persist and evade host immune stimulation .
Soutourina , et . al . , identified a single transcriptional start site ( TSS ) for the early flagellar operon in C . difficile strain 630Δerm , located nearly 500 nucleotides ( nt ) upstream of the start codon for flgB , the first gene in this operon [62] . The flgB operon is also termed the “F3 locus” elsewhere [21] . The promoter for the flgB operon contains a σA consensus sequence [62] . The first 160 nt of the 5’ untranslated region ( UTR ) of the flgB operon contains a class I ( GEMM ) c-di-GMP riboswitch , previously named Cd1 [61] . Binding of c-di-GMP to Cd1 causes premature transcription termination , preventing flagellar gene transcription and inhibiting swimming motility [59 , 61 , 62] . Notably , an additional 338 nt lie between the Cd1 termination site and the start codon of flgB . We speculated that the remaining 338 nt of the 5’ UTR contains an additional regulatory element that controls expression of the flgB operon . To explore this possibility , we used Clustal Omega [63] to generate multiple sequence alignments and examine the 5’ UTR of the flgB operon for regions of reduced sequence identity . Assuming the TSS is conserved in all strains , we found that all C . difficile genome sequences currently available through NCBI contain a 498 nt 5’ UTR , except 630 which has a 496 nt 5’ UTR . Strains of the 027 ribotype , which is associated with epidemics of CDI , were used for further analysis: CD196 ( NCBI Accession No . FN538970 . 1 ) , R20291 ( FN545816 . 1 ) , 2007855 ( FN665654 . 1 ) , and BI1 ( FN668941 . 1 ) [19 , 64 , 65] . The 5’ UTRs of three strains exhibited 100% sequence identity , but BI1 had only 66 . 2% identity in a 154 bp region ( Fig 1A ) . Upon further scrutiny of the region , we identified near perfect 21 bp inverted repeats flanking the 154 bp region: 5’- AAGTT ( A/G ) CTAT ( A/T ) TTACAAAAAA-3’ ( Left inverted repeat ) . The presence of a sequence flanked by inverted repeats located upstream of genes encoding an immunostimulatory surface structure suggested a regulatory mechanism involving phase variation by site specific DNA recombination . These features reflect a regulatory mechanism employed by numerous mucosal bacterial pathogens to stochastically control the expression of cell surface structures that may be immunostimulatory , therefore promoting immune evasion and persistence in a host [66] . We reasoned that the reduced sequence identity for BI1 at the 154 bp region could be due to DNA inversion between the inverted repeats . To test this , we repeated the multiple sequence alignment using the antiparallel , “inverse” sequence for the 154 bp sequence for BI1 and observed restoration of 100% identity to the other ribotype 027 sequences ( Fig 1A ) . Based on these in silico findings , we hypothesized that the 154 bp sequence undergoes inversion via site-specific recombination , and we term this the “flagellar switch” herein . If the 154 bp sequence is capable of undergoing DNA inversion , we expect to detect the flagellar switch in both of the orientations in C . difficile , at least under some growth conditions . To test this , we used an orientation-specific PCR assay to detect and differentiate between the two orientations of the putative flagellar switch in multiple C . difficile strains grown in liquid medium ( Fig 1B ) [67 , 68] . We use “published orientation” to refer to the sequence present in the indicated published genome for the given strain , and “inverse orientation” to refer to a sequence with an inversion between the inverted repeats . A common reverse primer , Rv , complementary to the flgB coding sequence was used in all PCRs ( Fig 1B , black ) . To detect the flagellar switch in the published orientation , we used a ribotype-specific forward primer F1 that anneals immediately 3’ of the left inverted repeat ( LIR ) ( Fig 1B , green ) . To detect the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation , we used a forward primer F2 that anneals immediately 5’ of the right inverted repeat ( RIR ) ( Fig 1B , red ) . Primers F1 and F2 are reverse-complementary . The primer pairs yield different products of different sizes depending on the orientation of the template sequence , and the sizes vary somewhat depending on the strain . We detected PCR products for both the published and inverse orientations for R20291 ( FN545816 . 1 ) and ATCC 43598 ( 017 ribotype , sequence read archive SRX656590 ) ( Fig 1C ) . DNA sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the orientation of the template sequences . Furthermore , DNA sequencing suggests that DNA strand exchange for recombination would have to occur at or after position 12 of the IRs , because the 6th and 11th nucleotides that are not conserved do not change . We were unable to detect a PCR product for the inverse orientation for 630Δerm ( Fig 1C ) , a commonly used laboratory-adapted strain . Unlike the other published C . difficile genomes , 630Δerm and its parental strain , 630 , have shorter 20 bp IRs with an adenosine absent from the 3’ end of the LIR and a thymidine absent from the 5’ end of the RIR . The length of IRs can impact DNA inversion [68] , which may explain the lack of an inverse product for 630Δerm . Collectively , these data indicate that at least some C . difficile strains grow in broth culture as a heterogeneous population of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published or inverse orientation , supporting our hypothesis that the flagellar switch undergoes site-specific recombination . Based on the previously identified inversion sites in the C . difficile genomes [69] , we designate the flagellar switch site as Cdi4 . We optimized an unbiased asymmetric PCR-digestion assay to distinguish the orientation of the switch and determine the relative proportions of each in the population ( Fig 2A ) [67 , 68 , 70] . One pair of primers that flank the flagellar switch amplify a region encompassing the 5’ UTR of the flgB operon , yielding a 665 bp product that was subjected to digestion with the restriction enzyme SwaI . The presence of a single SwaI restriction site in the 154 bp flagellar switch resulted in two fragments of different sizes depending on the orientation of the sequence ( Fig 2A ) . If the flagellar switch is in the published orientation , we expect fragments of 312 and 353 bp; if the switch is in the inverse orientation , we expect fragments of 418 and 247 bp . All four products are expected for a mixed population . Spore preparations of C . difficile R20291 , which contain a mix of bacteria with respect to flagellar switch orientation ( S1 Fig ) , were plated on BHIS agar supplemented with the germinant taurocholate . Germinated colonies were collected and spotted onto standard BHIS agar . We observed that over 96 hours , the R20291 colony morphology changed from smooth and circular to a spreading , filamentous colony ( Fig 2B ) . Genomic DNA was isolated from replicate colonies every 24 hours , and the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay was performed after all samples were processed . Over time , the abundance of the SwaI digested products indicating the inverse orientation increased ( Fig 2C ) . The proportions of bacteria with the switch in the two orientations were quantified by measuring the pixel intensities of the bands , normalized to a standard curve generated with titrated amounts of SwaI-digested DNA template for the published and inverse orientations [71] . The proportion of the bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation significantly increased after 48 hours ( median of 33 . 8% , P < 0 . 005 ) , 72 hours ( 39 . 0% , P < 0 . 05 ) , and 96 hours ( 67 . 4% , P < 0 . 05 ) compared to 24 hours ( 26 . 4% ) ( Fig 2D ) . These data provide evidence of DNA inversion and suggest that growth on a solid agar surface favors the accumulation of C . difficile with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation . Single colonies derived from this growth ( 24–96 hours on BHIS agar ) were subjected to the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay to determine the orientation of the flagellar switch . Individual colonies were enriched for one orientation of the flagellar switch . All colonies tested yielded either 312 and 353 bp fragments indicating the switch in the published orientation ( Fig 3A ) or 418 and 247 bp fragments indicating the switch in the inverse orientation ( Fig 3B ) . However , the asymmetric PCR-digestion has limited sensitivity for detection of low abundance targets . Thus , we used quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) of genomic DNA to quantify the frequency of bacteria with the flagellar switch in each orientation . In isolated colonies that showed fragments indicating the switch is in the published orientation by asymmetric PCR-digestion ( Fig 3A ) , 89 . 5% ( +/- 6 . 6% SD ) of the population had the switch in that orientation by qPCR ( Fig 3C ) . Similarly , in colonies with the switch predominantly in the inverse orientation by asymmetric PCR-digestion ( Fig 3B ) , 96 . 3% ( +/- 2 . 2% SD ) of the population has the switch in that orientation by qPCR ( Fig 3C ) . These data indicate that asymmetric PCR-digestion successfully identifies colonies that are enriched for the flagellar switch in a single orientation . Furthermore , the orientation of the flagellar switch remains stable during growth on an agar surface for at least 24 hours and switch orientation did not affect growth ( S2 Fig ) . We note that during these experiments , we observed two distinct colony morphologies based on colony texture and edge—a smooth , circular ( SC ) morphotype , and a rough , filamentous ( RF ) morphotype ( S3 Fig ) . The percentage of RF colonies increased , and the percentage of SC colonies decreased over time ( S3 Fig ) . Bacteria from SC and RF colonies maintained their respective characteristic morphologies after passaging ( S3 Fig ) . Colony morphology was not attributable to the orientation of the flagellar switch , as 72% of bacteria in the SC colonies had the flagellar switch in the published orientation , and 64% of bacteria in the RF colonies had the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation ( S3 Fig ) . The enrichment of two populations based on the orientation of the flagellar switch allowed us to determine the impact of switch orientation on downstream gene expression . We purified colonies with the flagellar switch in the published and inverse orientations ( Fig 4A ) to assess gene expression . The abundances of early and late stage flagellar gene transcripts in the isolates were compared by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR ( qRT-PCR ) . Bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation exhibited significantly reduced abundance of early stage flagellar gene transcripts , such as flgB and sigD/fliA , compared to bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published orientation ( Fig 4B ) [23 , 44] . Accordingly , the abundances of the σD-dependent , late stage flagellar gene transcripts CDR20291_0227 ( autolysin ) , flgM ( flagellar anti-sigma factor ) , and fliC ( flagellin ) ( Fig 4B ) were also significantly decreased in bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation . Consistent with this , transmission electron microscopy showed that the majority of bacteria from colonies with the flagellar switch in the published orientation displayed flagella ( 72% flagellated , n = 144 ) , whereas bacteria from colonies with the switch in the inverse orientation were largely non-flagellated ( 98% non- flagellated , n = 163 ) ( Fig 4C ) . We also note that C . difficile strain R20291 was previously reported to produce a single flagellum [31] , but we observed peritrichous flagella on our R20291 isolate . In addition , we generated a transcriptional fusion of mCherryOpt , encoding a Red Fluorescent Protein-derivative ( RFP ) optimized for translation in C . difficile [72 , 73] , to the flgM promoter . The flgM gene was previously determined to be positively regulated by σD [23 , 44] . As σD is encoded in the flgB operon , it is indirectly phase variable and serves as an indicator of the status of the flagellar switch . This plasmid-borne reporter ( PflgM::mCherryOpt ) was introduced into C . difficile R20291 isolates with the switch in the published or inverse orientation . In the isolate with the switch in the published orientation , the majority of bacteria were mCherryOpt positive: 76 . 7% ( +/- 9 . 8% SD ) . In the isolate with the switch in the inverse orientation , few bacteria were mCherryOpt positive: 2 . 4% ( +/- 2 . 2% SD ) ( Fig 4D ) . These values are consistent with those obtained using qPCR to directly evaluate the switch orientation in these populations ( Fig 3C ) . Differences in the frequency of the switch orientation in enriched flg ON populations could be due to additional flagellar gene regulators that function independently of the flg switch , such as c-di-GMP [59 , 62] . Negative controls bearing promoterless mCherryOpt ( ::mCherryOpt ) lacked fluorescence ( S4 Fig ) ; positive controls with inducible mCherryOpt ( Ptet::mCherryOpt ) showed more uniform red fluorescence ( S4 Fig ) . We additionally constructed a sigD mutant in R20291 by Targetron insertional mutagenesis as a negative control ( S5 Fig ) . The sigD mutant containing the PflgM::mCherryOpt reporter lacked mCherryOpt fluorescence , indicating that flgM promoter activity is dependent on σD , and therefore on the flagellar switch ( Fig 4D ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the orientation of the flagellar switch controls flagellar gene expression and are consistent with phase variable gene expression . Thus , bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published orientation express flagellar genes and produce flagella and are thus flagellar phase ON ( “flg ON” hereafter ) ; bacteria with the switch in the inverse orientation show decreased flagellar gene expression and flagellum biosynthesis and are comparatively flagellar phase OFF ( “flg OFF” hereafter ) . Given that flg OFF bacteria were deficient in flagellum biosynthesis ( Fig 4 ) , we predicted that flg OFF bacteria would be non-motile compared to motile flg ON bacteria . To test this , enriched flg ON and OFF isolates were examined for the ability to swim through BHIS-0 . 3% agar [59] . The R20291 sigD mutant was used as a non-motile control . The flg OFF bacteria appeared motile ( Fig 5A ) , though they displayed a modest but statistically significant reduction in swimming diameter at 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation compared to flg ON isolates ( Fig 5B ) . We reasoned that the enriched flg OFF inoculum would result in spatial restriction of non-motile bacteria to the inoculation site . In contrast , the small fraction of flg ON bacteria ( detectable by qPCR and fluorescent reporters but below the limitation of detection by asymmetric PCR digestion assay ) would be capable of motility and chemotaxis and therefore expand from the inoculation site , spatially segregating from flg OFF bacteria . To test this , for flg ON and OFF isolates cultured in motility agar , we sampled bacteria from the inoculation site ( center ) and from the leading edge at 24 , 48 , and 72 hours and determined the orientation of the switch using the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay . As expected , flg ON maintained the flagellar switch in the ON orientation at all time points at both the center and edge ( Fig 5C , top ) . In contrast , flg OFF bacteria from the center contained the switch primarily in the OFF configuration , but bacteria at the leading edge had the switch to the ON orientation by 24 hours ( Fig 5C , bottom ) . The flg ON orientation was subsequently preserved along the leading edge at 48 and 72 hours ( Fig 5C , bottom ) . These results indicate that growth in motility medium introduced a selection barrier that restricted flg OFF bacteria to the inoculation site and allowed the expansion of a low frequency population of flg ON bacteria . The flagellar alternative sigma factor , σD , controls transcription of genes within the Pathogenicity Locus ( PaLoc ) in addition to late stage flagellar genes in C . difficile [22 , 23 , 44] . Therefore , we predicted that the flagellar switch , which impacts the expression of sigD ( Fig 4B ) , also indirectly controls the expression of the toxin genes tcdA and tcdB by activating the expression of the toxin sigma factor gene tcdR . We compared the expression of tcdA , tcdB and tcdR in flg ON and OFF isolates using qRT-PCR . The abundances of the tcdR , tcdA and tcdB transcripts were significantly reduced in flg OFF bacteria compared to flg ON ( Fig 6A ) . Consistent with these results , TcdA protein level was also decreased in cell lysates of flg OFF bacteria compared to lysates of flg ON bacteria ( Fig 6B ) . TcdB levels were below the limit of detection by western blot . TcdA and TcdB are exported protein toxins that inactivate host cell Rho and Rac GTPases through glucosylation , resulting in actin depolymerization and reduced host cell viability [13–16] . To determine the effect of the flagellar switch on C . difficile cytotoxicity , filter-sterilized supernatants from flg ON and OFF isolates were tested in a cell viability assay with Vero cells . Flg ON isolates were significantly more cytotoxic compared to flg OFF isolates and a sigD control ( Fig 6C ) . Taken together , these data demonstrate that the flagellar switch orientation controls toxin production in addition to flagellum biosynthesis and swimming motility , indicating that these major virulence factors are coordinately phase variable in C . difficile . Multiple mechanisms driving phase variable gene expression have been described: general homologous recombination , conservative site-specific recombination , short sequence repeat and slip strand mispairing , and DNA methylation [66 , 74 , 75] . Classically , an invertible DNA element that undergoes site-specific recombination contains a promoter as the regulatory feature , and the orientation of the invertible DNA element ( and promoter ) determines whether the downstream genes are expressed . For example , in E . coli the orientation of the fimS switch , which contains a promoter , controls type I fimbrial gene expression [76] . In contrast , in C . difficile , the genetic switch that regulates expression of cwpV operates after transcription initiation [68] . In cwpV phase ON bacteria , transcriptional read-through of the 5’ UTR and the cwpV coding sequence occurs . In cwpV phase OFF bacteria , the inversion of a DNA sequence in the 5’ UTR leads to formation of a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator and results in premature transcription termination preventing expression of cwpV . To begin to define the mechanism by which the flagellar switch controls gene expression , we generated a series of alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) transcriptional reporters ( Fig 7A ) [77] . First , the phoZ reporter gene was placed downstream of flgB ( first gene of the flgB operon ) , under the control of the native flgB promoter and the full 498 bp 5’ UTR with the flagellar switch ( FS ) in either the phase ON or OFF orientation ( PflgB-5’UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ , Fig 7A , #3 & 4 ) . To determine if the flagellar switch contains a promoter , a truncated 307 bp 5’ UTR retaining the flagellar switch ( either phase ON or OFF orientation ) but lacking the Cd1 riboswitch and native flgB promoter was placed upstream of flgB::phoZ ( FSON/OFF-flgB::phoZ , Fig 7A , #5 & 6 ) . A transcriptional fusion of phoZ to the flgB promoter ( PflgB::phoZ , Fig 7A , #2 ) served as a positive control for the assay , and a promoterless construct ( ::phoZ , Fig 7A , #1 ) was included as a negative control . All reporter fusions were integrated onto the chromosome of an R20291 flg ON isolate , and AP activity was assessed . In parallel with every AP assay , an asymmetric PCR-digestion assay was performed to ensure that the flagellar switches were in the expected orientation for both the native locus and the reporter fusion ( S6 Fig ) . As anticipated , the promoterless control showed no AP activity , and the presence of the flgB promoter significantly increased activity ( Fig 7B ) . The PflgB-5’UTR ( FSOFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporter strain had significantly reduced activity compared to the PflgB-5’UTR ( FSON ) -flgB::phoZ reporter strain ( Fig 7B ) , consistent with previous results ( Fig 4 ) . No AP activity was detected in strains bearing the FSON/OFF-flgB::phoZ fusions ( Fig 7B ) . Similar results were obtained using the same six reporter fusions integrated onto the chromosome of a R20291 with the native flagellar switch in the OFF orientation , although AP activity was lower overall ( S7 Fig ) . These results suggest that the flagellar switch does not contain a promoter to initiate transcription independently of the flgB promoter . We considered alternative mechanisms by which expression could be inhibited in bacteria with the switch in the OFF orientation: ( 1 ) the formation of a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator , ( 2 ) the requirement for a trans-acting element such as an RNA binding protein or small non-coding RNA that selectively inhibits transcription , or ( 3 ) a Rho-dependent terminator . To examine these possibilities , we evaluated the activity of the phoZ reporters in a heterologous bacterium , B . subtilis , in which C . difficile-specific factors will be absent , but features inherent to the flagellar switch will be preserved . The reporter fusions ( Fig 7A ) were integrated into the B . subtilis BS49 chromosome , and the orientation of the flagellar switch was monitored by orientation-specific PCR ( S6 Fig ) . As in C . difficile , the positive control strain with the PflgB::phoZ fusion showed high AP activity , but no activity was observed for the::phoZ negative control ( Fig 7B ) . Also consistent with C . difficile , B . subtilis with the FSON/OFF-flgB::phoZ fusions produced negligible AP activity , indicating the absence of a promoter in the flagellar switch ( Fig 7C ) . In contrast to the C . difficile results , we observed comparable AP activity in B . subtilis with PflgB-5’UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporters ( Fig 7C ) . Thus , reduced gene expression as a result of the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation is specific to C . difficile , indicating that the regulatory feature is not inherent to the sequence , instead supporting the role of a trans-acting factor that is specific to C . difficile . When considered along with the qRT-PCR data from Figs 4B and 6A , these results suggest regulation post-transcription initiation from the flgB operon promoter and implicates changes in RNA stability or premature termination . Therefore , we used northern blot analysis to determine if transcription terminates prematurely or if the transcript is destabilized when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation . We were unable to detect the full-length transcript for the flgB operon ( ~ 23 kb ) using a probe specific to the Cd1 region of the 5’ UTR , so we used strains with the PflgB-5’UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporters in the R20291 flg ON background to evaluate premature transcription termination . We observed an RNA corresponding to a full-length transcript of ~2400 nt for the PflgB-5’UTR ( FSON ) -flgB::phoZ reporter but reduced transcript for the PflgB-5’UTR ( FSOFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporter ( Fig 7D ) . Furthermore , we did not detect a smaller transcript species other than termination through the Cd1 riboswitch , which eliminates the possibility of Rho-dependent or -independent termination unless the transcript is degraded faster than we can detect by northern blot . Collectively , the reporter assays in C . difficile flg ON and OFF and in B . subtilis with northern blot analysis suggest that regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and involves an unidentified trans-acting element that destabilizes the mRNA to reduce gene expression in flg OFF bacteria . Serine and tyrosine recombinases catalyze site-specific recombination to mediate DNA inversion at phase variable genetic switches in a RecA-independent manner [78 , 79] . In E . coli , two recombinases catalyze inversion at the fimbrial switch; FimB can catalyze both orientations , whereas FimE is restricted to ON to OFF inversion events [80 , 81] . A conserved tyrosine recombinase called RecV catalyzes strand exchange in both orientations at the cwpV switch in C . difficile [68 , 82–84] . We postulated that the recombinase ( s ) which catalyze inversion at the flg switch would be present in all published C . difficile genomes with intact flagellum biosynthesis genes . We identified eight conserved serine or tyrosine recombinases , including RecV ( CDR20291_1004 ) , and used a two-plasmid system in a heterologous bacterium to identify the flagellar switch recombinase ( s ) [68] . One plasmid contains one of the eight recombinase genes cloned downstream of an anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) inducible promoter [85] , and the second plasmid contains one of the PflgB-5’UTR ( FSON/OFF ) -flgB::phoZ reporters ( Fig 7A , #3 & 4 ) . The plasmids were transformed into E . coli , induced with ATc , and orientation-specific PCR was used on purified plasmids to determine if inversion occurred . We found that RecV was sufficient to catalyze recombination of the flagellar switch from the ON to OFF ( Fig 8A ) and OFF to ON ( Fig 8B ) orientations in E . coli; the other seven were unable to promote recombination . These data indicate that the RecV recombinase is sufficient to catalyze inversion in both orientations at both the flagellar and cwpV switches in a heterologous organism . These data do not rule out the possibility of an additional recombinase that requires a trans-acting element , such as a recombination directionality factor [86] , to catalyze inversion at the flagellar switch . To determine whether RecV is involved in inversion of the flagellar switch in C . difficile , we first overexpressed recV in the backgrounds of R20291 flg ON and OFF using the anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) -inducible expression vector to determine whether RecV would promote inversion to the opposite orientation [87] . We found that overexpression of recV in the flg ON and OFF backgrounds leads to a mixed population of both orientations compared to empty vector , regardless of the presence of ATc ( S8 Fig , panel A ) . Transcription of recV in the ATc-inducible expression vector was leaky in the absence of inducer ( S8 Fig , panel B ) , which is in line with previous work [87 , 88] . The C . difficile R20291 recV mutants were previously shown to be phase-locked for CwpV production [83 , 84] . The identification of RecV as the recombinase mediating flagellar switch inversion suggests that mutation of recV would similarly result in phase-locked phenotypes with respect to flagellum and toxin production . To evaluate the requirement of RecV for flagellar phase variation in C . difficile , we obtained two C . difficile R20291 mutants with ClosTron insertions in recV ( kind gift from Dr . Louis-Charles Fortier ) . One mutant contains the cwpV switch locked in the ON orientation , and the other , the OFF orientation [82 , 83] . Both mutants contain the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation ( herein , “flg OFF*” ) , as determined using orientation-specific PCR ( Figs 1B and 8C ) . To obtain a recV mutant in which the flagellar switch is locked in the ON orientation , recV was expressed from a plasmid to allow inversion of the flagellar switch ( Fig 8C ) . This complemented strain was then passaged in the absence of antibiotic selection to allow loss of the plasmid . Thiamphenicol-sensitive clones were screened for flagellar switch orientation to identify recV mutants that are flg ON ( herein , “flg ON*” ) ( S9 Fig ) . The recV flg ON* and OFF* mutants , each bearing vector or recV under the control of the Ptet ATc-inducible promoter , were assayed for swimming motility in BHIS-0 . 3% agar . A non-motile sigD mutant and enriched flg ON and OFF isolates were included as controls . Unlike the enriched flg OFF isolate that appeared motile due to a small frequency of flg ON bacteria , the recV flg OFF* mutant was non-motile at 24 hours incubation ( Fig 9A and 9B ) . This phase-locked phenotype was dependent on RecV , as complementation with recV in trans restored motility . In contrast , the recV flg ON* mutant showed motility , and providing recV in trans had no measurable effect in this assay . We note that extended incubation ( greater than 24 hours ) of the recV flg OFF* mutant results in motile progeny ( S10 Fig ) . These motile bacteria retain the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation based on orientation-specific PCR and DNA sequencing results ( S10 Fig ) , so the motile phenotype is due to suppressor mutations . We next evaluated toxin production by the recV flg ON* and OFF* mutants by measuring TcdA production by western blot . As shown above , the enriched flg OFF isolate produced less TcdA than the enriched flg ON isolate ( Fig 9C , lanes 1 , 2 ) . TcdA levels were greater in the recV flg ON* mutant compared to the enriched flg ON isolate . The difference is likely attributable to the presence of ~10 . 5% or 23 . 2% of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation remaining in the enriched flg ON isolate based on qPCR and fluorescence microscopy estimates , respectively ( Figs 3C and 4D ) . TcdA abundance in the recV flg OFF* mutant was comparable to that in the sigD mutant , which was below the limit of detection . Provision of recV in trans in either the recV flg ON* or OFF* mutant , which results in heterogeneity in the orientation of the flagellar switch ( Fig 8D ) , resulted in intermediate TcdA levels ( Fig 9C , lanes 5 , 7 ) . The observed differences in TcdA levels among the strains appear to depend on the proportion of flg ON and OFF bacteria in the population . These results indicate that RecV mediates flagellum and toxin phase variation , in addition to CwpV phase variation , in C . difficile .
Colonization is a prerequisite step to diarrheal disease development in C . difficile infection . The identification of colonization factors and the mechanisms controlling their production is an active area of study . Transcriptional regulators [51–53] , a peptide-based quorum sensing system [29] , and an RNA chaperone [54] activate or repress flagellar gene expression , albeit the exact regulatory mechanisms remain undetermined . Prior to this study , Cd1 , a class I c-di-GMP sensing riboswitch , was the only identified cis-acting regulatory element to control flagellar gene expression [59 , 61 , 62] . Here , we report an additional cis-acting regulatory element , a “flagellar switch , ” present upstream of the early stage flagellar operon . The flagellar switch is the fourth identified C . difficile inversion site ( Cdi4 ) and consists of a 154 bp sequence flanked by 21 bp imperfect inverted repeats [69] . The flagellar switch is functional , undergoing site-specific recombination in at least two different C . difficile ribotypes , 027 and 017 . The flagellar switch inverted repeats are conserved in all sequenced C . difficile genomes that contain the flagellum biosynthesis genes , except the 630 genome has shortened 20 bp inverted repeats ( S11 Fig ) . The flagellar switch appears locked ON in C . difficile 630 , which may be due to the shortened inverted repeats . Alternatively , the 630 genome ( 012 ribotype ) may differ in RecV transcription , production , or activity compared to the 027 and 017 ribotype strains , although there are no obvious differences in the recV promoter or open reading frame sequences to indicate that this is the case . Genetic evidence suggests that reduced inverted repeat length can impair recombination at the cwpV switch in C . difficile [68] . The cwpV switch ( Cdi1 ) controls the production of a large cell wall protein that promotes bacterial aggregation in vitro and is postulated to promote intestinal colonization [68 , 82] . CwpV may also contribute to C . difficile survival in the host by conferring resistance to predation by bacteriophages [84] . Deposition of CwpV on the surface of C . difficile reduces phage adsorption and specifically prevents the injection of phage DNA into the bacterial cell [84] . The other two identified inversion sites in C . difficile , although not yet demonstrated to be functional switches , are under active investigation . Unlike the cwpV switch that controls the expression of a single structural gene , the flagellar switch controls the expression of both structural and regulatory genes , including sigD . Flagellar phase ON bacteria , as well as a recV mutant with the flagellar switch locked in the ON orientation , display peritrichous flagella , engage in swimming motility , and produce the glucosylating toxins . Flagellar phase OFF bacteria and recV mutants with the flagellar switch locked in the OFF orientation are attenuated for transcription of flagellar genes , and therefore grow as aflagellate , non-motile bacteria also attenuated for toxin production . Thus , the flagellar switch coordinately controls the production of a colonization factor and essential virulence determinants by impacting sigD expression . Moreover , the flagellar switch orientation is expected to affect additional genes in the σD regulon , such as metabolic pathways , multiple cell wall proteins , metabolic transporters for amino acids and divalent cations , and several transcriptional regulators [23] . Classically , genetic switches that toggle between two orientations and facilitate phase variable expression of downstream genes contain a promoter to alter transcription initiation [66] . Transcriptional reporter data excluded the presence of a promoter within the flagellar switch , indicating that the switch controls downstream gene expression after transcription initiation from the flgB operon promoter has occurred . Indeed , the switch is within the previously defined 5’ UTR of the flgB ( F3 ) operon , downstream of the c-di-GMP riboswitch [62] . This arrangement of regulatory elements suggests that flagellar phase variation is only relevant when c-di-GMP levels are sufficiently low to permit transcriptional read-through beyond the riboswitch and into the flagellar switch . Regulation post-transcription initiation by genetic switches has been described previously . The cwpV switch in C . difficile also lacks promoter activity and instead regulates cwpV expression post-transcriptionally [68] . When the switch is in the cwpV phase OFF orientation , the mRNA adopts a structure containing a Rho-independent terminator resulting in premature transcription termination [68] . In E . coli , the fimE mRNA is subject to regulation post transcription initiation . FimE is encoded immediately 5’ of fimS , and when fimS is in the OFF orientation , the fimE mRNA forms a Rho-dependent terminator that reduces transcript stability [89] . If the flagellar switch in C . difficile contained a Rho-independent terminator , we would expect no AP activity in B . subtilis when the flagellar switch was in the OFF orientation . However , AP activity was indistinguishable between the flg ON and OFF reporters in B . subtilis , suggesting a trans-acting regulatory element that is expressed only in C . difficile . We note that AP activity from the reporters was substantially higher in B . subtilis compared to C . difficile; it is possible that a regulatory factor in B . subtilis masked the unidentified trans-acting regulatory factor . Moreover , northern blot analysis suggests a mechanism independent of both Rho-dependent and independent termination since we were unable to detect a truncated transcript from the phase OFF condition . Collectively , our results suggest that the early stage flagellar operon mRNA is destabilized or degraded when the flagellar switch DNA is in the OFF orientation . We speculate that a constitutively-expressed C . difficile-specific regulatory factor , either an RNA binding protein or small , non-coding RNA , binds to the leader sequence of the mRNA to directly or indirectly degrade or destabilize the mRNA . Thus , the flagellar switch in C . difficile represents a novel system that requires an unknown additional regulatory factor to function as an ON/OFF switch . In many mucosal pathogens , phase variation is a regulatory feature that modulates the expression of an immunostimulatory cell surface structure [66] . Flagellar phase variation occurs in Clostridium chauvoei [90] , Salmonella enterica serovar enterica Typhimurium [91 , 92] , Helicobacter pylori [93] , and Campylobacter jejuni [94] . Wild strains of B . subtilis grown under planktonic conditions bifurcate into two distinct populations: flagellated , motile single bacteria and aflagellate , non-motile chains of bacteria [95] . Expression and activity of σD determines whether these populations arise in B . subtilis . Expression of swrA , which encodes a master regulator of swarming motility , is subject to phase variation by slip strand mispairing in the coding sequence [95–97] . SwrA controls transcription of the flagellar and chemotaxis ( fla/che ) operon by regulating the activity of the transcriptional regulator DegU [98] . SigD , encoded within the fla/che operon , also positively regulates swrA transcription [98] . Thus , a feedforward loop resulting from swrA expression introduces a bias for σD ON bacteria that are flagellated and motile . These and other data present a model in which flagellar gene expression in B . subtilis is bistable [97] . Although additional work is needed to determine if C . difficile flagellar gene expression meets the criteria of bistability [99–101] , inversion of the C . difficile flagellar switch similarly results in phenotypic heterogeneity that would confer an advantage in an environment that selects for one phenotype over the other [99–101] . Thus , B . subtilis and C . difficile may use distinct mechanisms to accomplish the same outcome . We identified RecV as necessary and sufficient for inversion of the flagellar switch in both orientations , by over-expression of recV in C . difficile and in E . coli bearing the flagellar switch sequence , and by mutation of recV in C . difficile R20291 . Notably , RecV was previously reported to control inversion of the cwpV switch in C . difficile [68 , 82] . The use of a single recombinase to control inversion of multiple genetic switches has been described previously . In Bacteroides fragilis , the Mpi recombinase controls inversion of at least 13 genetic switches , including seven switches that control expression of different capsular polysaccharide loci [102] . These switches are scattered through the genome and contain inverted repeats that harbor a 10 bp core consensus sequence [102] . In contrast , the inverted repeats and the flanking half sites for the cwpV and flagellar switches lack recognizable sequence identity , although the identification of additional RecV-controlled genetic switches might reveal a core consensus sequence . RecV may bind the recognition sequences with different affinities , allowing hierarchical inversion of switches bearing disparate inverted repeats . Regulation of recV transcription and/or RecV activity could therefore differentially affect inversion of the cwpV and flagellar switches . Hierarchical binding could be achieved solely by RecV , or via additional proteins that direct RecV to specific target sequences . The need for these binding partners may have been bypassed in E . coli due to over-expression of recV . It is also possible that trans-acting DNA binding proteins , such as a histone-like protein or recombination directionality factor ( RDF ) [86 , 103] , influence DNA bending to affect the recombination reaction at RecV-controlled genetic switches . Such DNA binding proteins can integrate environmental signals to bias switch orientation and generate genetic variants that have a fitness advantage in that environment . For example , leucine-responsive regulatory protein and H-NS affect the recombination reaction at fimS in E . coli [104 , 105] . The existence of factors influencing RecV activity in C . difficile is supported by the observation that C . difficile R20291 carrying the prophage ϕCD38-2 has the cwpV switch biased to the ON orientation; recV transcription is unaltered [83] . Prophage infection of a recV mutant with the cwpV switch in the OFF orientation remains locked , suggesting that the phage does not encode a recombinase to promote inversion , but that instead a phage gene product modulates RecV activity [83] . ϕCD38-2 did not affect flagellum or toxin gene transcription in R20291 , but C . difficile may produce another factor that similarly influences recombination within the flagellar ( and cwpV ) switch . Recent evidence demonstrates a role for RDFs in C . difficile physiology: an RDF pairs with a serine recombinase to excise a prophage-like element from a sporulation-specific sigma factor gene [106] . Future studies will explore how RecV can control multiple genetic switches with divergent inverted repeat sequences . Ultimately , iterative combinations of cwpV and flg ON and OFF phenotypes may influence C . difficile fitness in the host intestinal environment . A dual cwpV and flg ON phenotype could facilitate penetration of the bacteriophage-rich colonic mucus [107] , and/or increase bacterial attachment to and colonization of the intestinal mucosa . Conversion of one or both phenotypes to phase OFF might reduce the probability of the host simultaneously developing an antibody response to these immunostimulatory surface structures . The role of flagellum and toxin phase variation in C . difficile pathogenesis remains to be determined , though it stands to reason that both the phase ON and OFF phenotypes confer advantages during the course of an infection . The flg ON bacteria would be competent for efficient intestinal colonization for R20291 [31] . Yet purified flagellin from multiple C . difficile strains can activate host Toll-like receptor 5 ( TLR5 ) and stimulate p38 MAPK activation and IL-8 secretion in vitro [47 , 108 , 109] . Although TLR5 is dispensable in a mouse model of CDI [49] , recombinant C . difficile FliC is immunogenic and protective in a mouse model of CDI [110] . In addition , the C . difficile glucosylating toxins have been implicated in activation of the NLRP3 and Pyrin inflammasomes , which could promote pathogen clearance [48 , 111] . C . difficile flg OFF bacteria could thus evade TLR5 recognition and inflammasome stimulation , enhancing bacterial colonization and persistence within the host . Future studies will determine the contribution of flagellum and toxin phase variation to C . difficile virulence .
The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in S1 Table , and details on their construction are in S1 Methods . C . difficile was maintained in an anaerobic chamber ( Coy Laboratories ) at an atmosphere of 90% N2 , 5% CO2 , and 5% H2 and grown in Brain Heart Infusion medium ( Becton Dickinson ) supplemented with 5% yeast extract ( Becton Dickinson ) ( BHIS ) at 37°C . Bacteria were also cultured in Tryptone Yeast ( TY ) broth media where indicated . All C . difficile broth cultures were grown statically . Escherichia coli DH5α , BL21 , and HB101 ( pRK24 ) were cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani ( LB ) medium with the indicated antibiotics for plasmid selection . Bacillus subtilis strain BS49 was grown in BHIS with the appropriate antibiotics . Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: chloramphenicol , 10 μg/ml; thiamphenicol , 10 μg/ml; kanamycin , 100 μg/ml; ampicillin , 100 μg/ml; erythromycin , 5 . 0 μg/ml , lincomycin 20 . 0 μg/ml . Spores of C . difficile strains 630Δerm , R20291 , and ATCC 43598 were plated on BHIS supplemented with 0 . 1% sodium taurocholate ( Sigma ) ( BHIS+TA ) . After 24 hours , individual colonies were grown in BHIS at 37°C . Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in fresh BHIS and grown to early stationary phase . An aliquot of each culture was diluted 1:5 into 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA ( TE ) buffer . Boiled lysates served as templates in PCR using primers designed for each strain based the genome sequences for strains 630 ( Accession No . AM180355 . 1 ) and R20291 ( Accession No . FN545816 . 1 ) . The ribotype 017 strain ATCC 43598 has not been sequenced , so we used M68 ( Accession No . FN688375 . 1 ) as a representative ribotype 017 strain to design primers for the flagellar switch . Primer sequences are listed in S2 Table . Primers R1614 ( published/ON orientation ) and R1615 ( inverse/OFF orientation ) were used for R20291 . Primers R1622 ( published/ON orientation ) and R1623 ( inverse/OFF orientation ) were used for ATCC 43598 . Primers R1751 ( published/ON orientation ) and R1752 ( inverse/OFF orientation ) were used for 630Δerm . All reactions used R857 as the reverse primer given the sequence identity between strains for the first gene in the early flagellar operon , flgB . The results shown are representative of three independent experiments each with at least two biological replicates for each strain . To amplify the flagellar switch , chromosomal DNA purified from C . difficile R20291 , as previously described [112] , served as the template in PCRs with primers R591 and R857 , yielding a product of 665bp . The PCR products ( 500 ng ) were digested with SwaI ( NEB ) , which results in different products depending on the orientation of the flagellar switch: 312 bp and 353 bp for the published orientation , and 418 bp and 247 bp for the inverse orientation ( Fig 2 ) . A mixture of bacteria with the flagellar switch in the published and inverse orientation results in four bands at varying intensities . SwaI reaction products were separated in 2 . 5% agarose gels , which were stained with ethidium bromide ( EtBr ) for imaging with a G:BOX Chemi Imaging system . For all experiments with purified phase variant populations , three or four biological replicates of R20291 flg ON and OFF were assessed by the asymmetric PCR-digest assay to ensure a homogeneous population . We used ImageJ to perform a densitometry analysis of the digested bands to determine the relative proportions of bacteria with flagellar switch in the published/ON ( 312 , 353 bp ) and inverse/OFF ( 418 , 247 bp ) orientations . The pixel intensities of published/ON or inverse/OFF bands were divided by the total pixel intensity for that sample . These values were normalized to a standard curve generated by mixing known quantities of flg ON and OFF plasmid template and subjecting them to the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay , giving the percentage of bacteria in a sample with the switch in a given orientation . To evaluate the effect of surface growth on the flagellar switch , C . difficile R20291 spores were plated on BHIS-TA to induce germination . After 24 hours , individual colonies were suspended and spotted onto four BHIS plates . Every 24 hours for four days , one plate was used for recovery of bacteria from colony for chromosomal DNA extraction . Once chromosomal DNA was collected , the orientation of the flagellar switch was determined using the asymmetric PCR-digestion assay . Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ software as described above . Values for bands corresponding to the published/ON and inverse/OFF orientations were compared to a standard curve . The data were combined from three independent experiments , each with two to four biological replicates . C . difficile R20291 spores were plated on BHIS+TA . After 24 hours , six to ten individual colonies were suspended in BHIS , spotted onto individual BHIS plates , and grown 24–96 hours as indicated . Single colonies were derived from this growth ( 24–96 hours ) by passaging onto BHIS plates and individually screened for the flagellar switch orientation by the asymmetric PCR digestion assay . A higher frequency of colonies with the flagellar switch in the OFF orientation was observed at later time points ( 96 hours ) . For all experiments using enriched flagellar phase variant populations , except the phoZ reporters , mCherry reporters , and cell viability assay , glycerol stocks were not made to ensure robust reproducibility of the phenotypes between independent experiments and reproducibility of the enrichment protocol . At least two to four biological replicates of flg phase ON and OFF populations were used for all experiments . In all reactions , SYBR Green Real-Time qPCR reagents ( Thermo Fisher ) were used , with primers at a final concentration of 500 nM and an annealing temperature of 55°C . Titrated amounts of genomic DNA from recV flg ON* and flg OFF* were used to determine the amount of template necessary for the reactions and the primer efficiency . Primers for detection of the ON orientation ( R2175 and R2177 ) had a PCR efficiency of 88 . 5% for the recV flg ON* DNA , and the primers for detection of the OFF orientation ( R2176 and R2177 ) had a PCR efficiency of 84 . 5% for the recV flg OFF* DNA . To determine the frequency of the flg ON and OFF orientations in populations of enriched C . difficile R20291 flg ON and OFF isolates , three biological replicates of each were grown in BHIS medium to an OD600 of ~1 . 0 , and chromosomal DNA was extracted as previously described [112] . Quantitative PCR was done using 4 ng of DNA from flg ON and OFF isolates . DNA copy number was calculated using the ΔΔCt method , with the rpoC gene as the indicated reference gene for DNA copy number . Isolated C . difficile flg ON and OFF variants were grown overnight in BHIS medium , 1:50 in 3mL of BHIS medium and grown to stationary phase ( OD600 of 1 . 8–2 . 0 ) . RNA was isolated as described previously [59 , 112] . Briefly , cells were collected by centrifugation and lysed by bead beating in cold TriSURE ( Bioline ) . Nucleic acid was extracted with chloroform ( Sigma ) , precipitated from the aqueous phase with isopropanol , washed with ethanol , and suspended in RNase-free water . To remove contaminating genomic DNA , RNA was treated with TURBO DNase ( Thermo Fisher ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Synthesis of cDNA was done using a Tetro cDNA Synthesis kit ( Bioline ) and random hexamers according to the manufacturer’s instructions and including a no-reverse transcriptase control . Real-time PCRs were done using 2 ng of cDNA and SYBR Green Real-Time qPCR reagents ( Thermo Fisher ) . Transcript abundance was calculated using the ΔΔCt method , with rpoC as the control gene and the indicated reference condition/strain [59] . C . difficile R20291 , flg ON and OFF isolates , and recV mutants were assayed for flagellar motility as previously described [59] . An R20291 sigD mutant was included as a non-motile control in all experiments . Details regarding the generation of the sigD mutant are in S1 Methods and S5 Fig . Autoclaved 0 . 5 X BHIS with 0 . 3% agar ( 30 mL ) was poured into 100 mm Petri dishes allowed to solidify overnight . These soft agar plates were kept in the anaerobic chamber for at least 4 hours prior to the experiment . Bacteria were grown in BHIS medium overnight , diluted 1:50 in fresh BHIS broth the next day , and grown to an OD600 of 1 . 0 . Two microliters of flg ON , flg OFF , and sigD were inoculated into the agar , then incubated at 37°C . The diameter of growth was measured after 24 , 48 , and 72 hours; two perpendicular measurements were made for each swim site and averaged for each replicate . Three to four biological replicates were evaluated , each in technical duplicate ( values averaged ) , in two independent experiments . Images were taken using the G:BOX Chemi imaging system with the Upper White Light illuminator . A Student’s t-test was used to determine statistical significance . C . difficile phoZ reporter strains were grown from glycerol stocks on BHIS plates and incubated at 37°C . After 24 hours , 2–3 colonies of each reporter strains were grown overnight in TY medium and diluted 1:50 into BHIS medium . Late exponential phase cells ( OD600 ≈ 1 . 5 , 1 . 5 mL ) were collected by centrifugation , the supernatant was discarded , and pellets were stored at -20°C overnight . Frozen pellets were thawed on ice and the alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) assay was performed as previously described [77] . Bacillus subtilis BS49 phoZ reporter strains were grown from glycerol stocks on BHIS-Erm plates under aerobic conditions , and the assay was done as above . Construction of AP reporters is described in S1 Methods . C . difficile phoZ reporter strains were grown in 4mL of BHIS medium to OD600 1 . 5 . Bacteria were collected by centrifugation , and RNA was extracted as described above with the following exceptions . Four rounds of bead beating were done , and the purified RNA was rigorously treated with DNase I to ensure removal of contaminating DNA . Digoxigenin ( DIG ) -labeled DNA probes for the northern blot were generated by PCR using genomic DNA from R20291 as template for the Cd1 probe and a 5S rRNA ( CDR20291_ r03 ) probe , a DIG High Prime kit was used ( Roche ) ( S1 Table ) . Reagents from the NorthernMax-Gly Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) were used for electrophoresis and hybridization . RNA samples ( 15ug for mRNA probe and 500ng for rRNA probe ) were briefly thawed on ice , mixed 1:1 with Glyoxal Load Dye , incubated at 50°C for 30 minutes , and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel made with 1X Gel Prep/Running Buffer . The agarose gel was imaged using the G:BOX Chemi Imaging system to confirm RNA integrity . The gel was briefly soaked in 20X SSC ( 3M NaCl and 300mM sodium citrate ) , then RNA was transferred via capillary action onto a nylon membrane ( Amersham Hybond-N+ ) overnight in 20X SSC for 16 hours . RNA was crosslinked to the membrane using a UV Stratalinker 1800 ( Stratagene ) . After prehybridization with ULTRAhyb buffer at 42°C for 1 hr , 4 μL of a DIG-labeled DNA probe specific to the Cd1 riboswitch or the 5S rRNA loading control gene was added . After 16 hours , the membrane washed in low and high stringency buffers sequentially ( NorthernMax-Gly Kit ) . To detect the DIG-labeled probes on the membrane , we used the buffers and followed the manufacturer’s instructions in the DIG High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II ( Roche ) and the chemiluminescent substrate CDP-Star ( Roche ) . Membranes were exposed to film , which was then imaged using a developer . C . difficile was grown as patches on BHIS agar for 24 hours . The patches were thoroughly suspended in BHIS , and cell densities were normalized to an OD600 1 . 0–1 . 5 . The cells were again pelleted by centrifugation and then suspended in 1X SDS-PAGE sample buffer [113] and heated at 95°C for 10 minutes . The lysates were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Bio-Rad ) . TcdA was detected using a mouse α-TcdA primary antibody ( Novus Biologicals ) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with IR800 ( Thermo Fisher ) as described previously [44] . Detection was done using a LI-COR Odyssey Imager ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . Three independent experiments were done , each with three to four biological replicates of flg ON and OFF isolates . Vero cells were seeded in 96 well plates at 8 , 000 cells per well in DMEM ( Life Technologies ) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum ( Sigma ) ( DMEM-FBS ) and 1X Penicillin/Streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) for 16 hours . C . difficile R20291 flg ON and OFF isolates , and a sigD mutant control , were grown on BHIS plates for 16–24 hours . Four colonies of each isolate/strain were grown in TY medium overnight , then diluted 1:50 into fresh TY and grown to stationary phase ( OD600 ≈ 2 . 0 ) . Cultures were normalized to the same OD600 . Bacteria were removed by centrifugation , and supernatants were collected , filter sterilized ( 0 . 45 micron ) , and serially diluted in TY medium . For each well with Vero cells , the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh DMEM-FBS . Supernatants were added in the following dilutions with cell culture media: 1:4 , 1:40 , 1:80 , 1:400 , and 1:800 . As a negative control , Vero cells were treated with TY medium at a 1:4 dilution in DMEM-FBS . After 24 hours at 37°C , the medium was carefully removed by aspiration , and 100 μL each of cell culture medium and Promega CellTiter Glo reagent were added to each well . After 10 minutes at room temperature on a shaker , Vero cell lysates were transferred to opaque-walled 96 well plates . Luminescence was measured using a Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader with Gen5 software ( BioTek ) . Data were combined from two independent experiments each with four biological replicates of each isolate/strain . Relevant E . coli strains are listed in S1 Table . Bacteria were passaged onto LB plates with ampicillin 50 μg/mL and kanamycin 50 μg/mL and grown overnight for single colonies . Bacteria were inoculated into LB with the above-mentioned antibiotics to grow overnight at 30°C , diluted 1:50 into fresh medium in duplicates , and grown to an OD600 0 . 4 . Anhydrotetracycline ( ATc ) was added to a biological replicate for each flagellar switch/recombinase pair at a final concentration of 200 ng/mL , grown until OD600 1 . 0 , and plasmids were purified using the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) . Purified plasmids were used as template in an orientation-specific PCR assay to identify the recombinase that catalyzes inversion from ON to OFF and OFF to ON . For transmission electron microscopy , C . difficile flg ON and OFF populations were isolated on BHIS agar plates as described above and briefly washed in Dulbecco’s PBS ( Sigma ) prior to suspension in PBS-4% paraformaldehyde for fixation for 1 hour in the anaerobic chamber . Cell suspensions were adsorbed onto Formvar/copper grids , washed in water , and stained for 30 seconds in two sequential drops of 1 . 5% aqueous uranyl acetate . Cells were observed on a LEO EM 910 Transmission Electron Microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microscopy , LLC , Thornword , NY ) and recorded with a Gatan Orius SC1000 digital camera with Digital Micrograph 3 . 11 . 0 software ( Gatan , Inc . , Pleaston , CA ) . To image bacterial colony morphology , we used a Zeiss Stereo Discovery V8 dissecting microscope with a glass stage for illumination of bacterial colonies with light from the top and bottom . For fluorescence microscopy , C . difficile enriched flg ON and OFF isolates and the sigD mutant bearing mCherryOpt reporter fusions ( S1 Table ) were cultured overnight in BHIS medium , diluted 1:50 in fresh BHIS medium , and grown to an OD600 of ~0 . 5 . For strains with the ATc-inducible mCherryOpt reporter ( pDSW1728 ) , 15 ng/mL of ATc was added to the culture at OD600 ~0 . 3 to induce transcription of the mCherryOpt gene . One milliliter of each culture was briefly pelleted in the anaerobic chamber , washed and suspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , and fixed according to published methods in PBS and paraformaldehyde [73] . After 3 hours in fixative in the dark at 4°C , bacterial pellets were washed three times in PBS and suspended in 0 . 5 mL PBS with 3 μg/mL 4′ , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) to label DNA . After overnight incubation at 4°C in the dark , samples were pelleted and suspended in 1 mL of PBS . Bacteria were immobilized on agar pads as previously described [73] and covered with 1 . 5 thickness glass cover slips ( ThermoFisher ) for fluorescence microscopy . The Olympus BX61 Upright Wide Field Microscope with a 60X/1 . 42 Oil PlanApo N objective lens was used for imaging samples , and Volocity 6 . 3 software was used for image acquisition . Multiple fields were taken for each sample in a coordinated fashion to ensure no repeated sections . Three images were automatically taken for each field in the differential contrast ( DIC ) channel , DAPI channel ( Excitation: 377 nm ( +/- 25 nm ) , Emission: 447 nm ( +/- 30nm ) ) , and Texas Red/RFP channel ( Excitation: 562 nm ( +/- 20 nm ) , Emission: 642 nm ( +/- 20 nm ) ) with consistent settings for side-by-side comparison . Images were processed using the FIJI version of ImageJ [114] , and bacteria were visually enumerated for +/- mCherryOpt fluorescence , with DAPI staining and DIC channels allowing imaging of all bacteria .","Clostridium difficile is a bacterial pathogen that causes antibiotic associated diarrheal disease . Colonization of host tissues is a prerequisite step to disease development during bacterial infection . C . difficile produces flagella , which are proteinaceous structures on the bacterial surface that confer motility and participate in adherence to the host intestine . SigD , a regulator that coordinates flagellar gene expression , also activates expression of the toxin genes in C . difficile . Therefore , mechanisms controlling expression of flagellar genes , including sigD , will likely impact the severity of C . difficile infection given the impact on toxin production . In this body of work , we identified a genetic ON/OFF switch , which we term the “flagellar switch” , encoded upstream of the flagellar genes . The orientation of the flagellar switch determines whether or not C . difficile produce flagella , engage in swimming motility , and secrete toxins . We identified the enzyme that catalyzes inversion of the flagellar switch . Inactivation of the corresponding gene resulted in bacteria with the flagellar switch locked in the either the ON or OFF orientation , with concomitant effects on flagellum and toxin biosynthesis . The flagellar switch may represent a new regulatory strategy to coordinately control virulence determinants independent of previously described regulators .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Materials' 'and'

8,"Endosporulation is an ancient bacterial developmental program that culminates with the differentiation of a highly resistant endospore . In the model organism Bacillus subtilis , gene expression in the forespore and in the mother cell , the two cells that participate in endospore development , is governed by cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma subunits . σF in the forespore , and σE in the mother cell control early stages of development and are replaced , at later stages , by σG and σK , respectively . Starting with σF , the activation of the sigma factors is sequential , requires the preceding factor , and involves cell-cell signaling pathways that operate at key morphological stages . Here , we have studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in the intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile , an obligate anaerobe in which the endospores are central to the infectious cycle . The morphological characterization of mutants for the sporulation sigma factors , in parallel with use of a fluorescence reporter for single cell analysis of gene expression , unraveled important deviations from the B . subtilis paradigm . While the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved , we show that the activity of σE is partially independent of σF , that σG activity is not dependent on σE , and that the activity of σK does not require σG . We also show that σK is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation . In all , our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors , and reduced requirement for the σF-to-σE , σE-to-σG , and σG-to-σK cell-cell signaling pathways . Nevertheless , our results support the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution , with the sigma factors acting as the key regulators of the pathway , established some 2 . 5 billion years ago upon its emergence at the base of the Firmicutes Phylum .
Endosporulation is an ancient bacterial cell differentiation program that culminates with the formation of a highly resistant dormant cell , the endospore . Bacterial endospores ( hereinafter designated spores for simplicity ) , as those formed by species of the well-known Bacillus and Clostridium genera , but also by many other groups within the Firmicutes phylum , resist to extremes of physical and chemical parameters that would rapidly destroy the vegetative cells , and are the most resistant cellular structure known [1] , [2] . Their resilience allows them to accumulate in highly diverse environmental settings , often for extremely long periods of time . The range of environments occupied by sporeformers , include niches within metazoan hosts , in particular the gastro-intestinal tract ( GIT ) ( e . g . [3]–[5] ) . B . subtilis , for example , a non-pathogenic sporeformer , can go through several cycles of growth , sporulation and germination in the GIT [5] . For pathogenic sporeformers , spores are often the infectious vehicle as in the inhalational or gastric forms of anthrax , the potentially lethal disease caused by B . anthracis [6] . Also , it is a protein present at the spore surface that mediates spore internalization by macrophages , and spore dissemination to local lymph nodes , which are central to pathogenesis [6] , [7] . Infection by the intestinal human and animal pathogen C . difficile , an obligate anaerobe , and the subject of the present investigation , often also starts with the ingestion of spores [8] , [9] . C . difficile is the causative agent of an intestinal disease whose symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to severe , potentially lethal inflammatory lesions such as pseudomembraneous colitis , toxic megacolon or bowel perforation [8] , [10] . Ingested spores of this organism germinate in the colon , to establish a population of vegetative cells that will produce two potent cytotoxins and more spores [8] , [10]–[12] . Infection develops because C . difficile can colonize the gut if the normal intestinal microbiota is disturbed [8] [9] . Toxinogenesis is responsible for most of the disease symptoms , whereas the spores , which can remain latent in the gut , are both a persistence and transmission factor [8] , [10]–[13] . While an asporogeneous mutant of C . difficile can cause intestinal disease , it is unable to persist within and transmit between host organism [13] . The spore thus has a central role in persistence of the organism in the environment , infection , recurrence and transmission of the disease . Recent years have seen the emergence of strains , so called hypervirulent , linked to increased incidence of severe disease , higher relapse rates and mortality , and C . difficile is now both a main nosocomial pathogen associated with antibiotic therapy as well as a major concern in the community [8] , [9] , [14] . The basic spore plan is conserved [15]–[17] . The genome is deposited in a central compartment delimited by a lipid bilayer with a layer of peptidoglycan ( PG ) apposed to its external leaflet . This layer of PG , known as the germ cell wall , will serve as the wall of the outgrowing cell that forms when the spore completes germination . The germ cell wall is encased in a thick layer of a modified form of PG , the cortex , essential for the acquisition and maintenance of heat resistance [15] , [16] . The cortex is wrapped by a multiprotein coat , which protects it from the action of PG-breaking enzymes produced by host organisms or predators [15] , [16] . In some species , including the pathogens B . anthracis , B . cereus and C . difficile , the coat is further enclosed within a structure known as the exosporium . The coat and the exosporium , when present , mediate the immediate interactions of the spore with the environment , including the interaction with small molecules that trigger germination [7] , [15] , [18]–[20] . The process of spore differentiation has been extensively studied in the model organism B . subtilis [21] [22] . Rod-shaped vegetative cells , growing by binary fission , will switch to an asymmetric ( polar ) division when facing severe nutritional stress . Polar division yields a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore , the future spore . The mother cell then engulfs the forespore . This process , akin to phagocytosis and a hallmark of endosporulation , isolates the forespore from the surrounding medium , and releases it as a cell , surrounded by a double membrane , within the mother cell cytoplasm [21] , [22] . With the exception of the germ cell wall , which is formed from the forespore , the assembly of the main spore protective structures is mostly a function of the mother cell [15] , [16] . At the end of the process , and following a period of spore maturation , the mother cell undergoes autolysis , to release the finished spore . For the organisms that have been studied to date , mostly by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , this basic sequence of morphological events appears conserved [15] , [21] . The developmental regulatory network of sporulation shows a hierarchical organization and functional logic [17] . A master regulatory protein , Spo0A , activated by phosphorylation , governs entry into sporulation , including the switch to asymmetric division [21] , [23] . Gene expression in the forespore and mother cell is controlled by 4 cell type-specific sigma factors , which are sequentially activated , alternating between the two cells . σF and σE control the early stages of development in the forespore and the mother cell , respectively , and are replaced by σG and σK when engulfment of the forespore is completed [21]–[23] . Activation of the sporulation sigma factors coincides with the completion of key morphological intermediates in the process , at which stages cell-cell signaling events further allow the alignment of the forespore and mother cell programs of gene expression . The result is the coordinated deployment of the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression , in close register with the course of cellular morphogenesis [21]–[23] . Additional regulatory proteins , working with the sigma factors , generate feed forward loops ( FFLs ) that create waves of gene expression , minimizing transcriptional noise and impelling morphogenesis forward [17] . A large number of genes of B . subtilis , distributed in the four cell type-specific regulons , participate in spore morphogenesis [24]–[27] . The key regulatory factors , Spo0A and the sporulation sigma factors , which define the highest level in the functional and evolutionary hierarchy of the sporulation network , are conserved in sporeformers . The FFLs show an intermediary level of conservation , with the “structural” genes , with the lower level of conservation , at the lowest level in the hierarchy [17] , [24]–[27] . The conservation of the sporulation sigma factors has suggested that their role and sequential activation is also maintained across species [17] . However , recent studies have revealed differences in the roles and time of activity of the sigma factors during spore morphogenesis in several Clostridial species [28]–[35] . For instance , σF and σE are active prior to asymmetric division in C . acetobutylicum and C . perfringens [30] , [31] , [33] , [35] . Also , σK , which in B . subtilis controls late stages of morphogenesis in the mother cell , is active in pre-divisional cells of C . perfringens and C . botulinum [29] , [34] . Collectively , and relative to the aerobic Bacilli , the Clostridia represent an older group within the Firmicutes phylum , at the base of which endosporulation has emerged some 2 . 5 billion years ago , before the initial rise in oxygen levels [24]–[28] , [36] . Despite the importance of C . difficile for human health and activities , and the central role of sporulation in the infection cycle , a cytological and molecular description of sporulation has been lacking . Here , we have combined cytological and genetics methodologies to define the sequence of sporulation events in C . difficile and the function of the cell type-specific sigma factors . In addition , by using a fluorescent reporter for studies of gene expression at the single cell level , we were able to correlate the expression and activity of the sporulation-specific sigma factors with the course of morphogenesis . A key observation is that during C . difficile sporulation the forespore and mother cell programs of gene expression are less tightly coupled . Our study also provides a platform for additional studies of the regulatory network and for integrating the expression and function of the effector genes , many of which will be species-specific , and possibly related to host colonization and transmission .
Earlier studies using TEM have suggested that the main stages of sporulation are conserved amongst Bacillus and Clostridial species [37] . Here , we examined sporulation of C . difficile using phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy with the goal of establishing a platform for both the phenotypic analysis of mutants blocked in the process and for the analysis of developmental gene expression in relation to the course of morphogenesis . This approach requires the individual scoring of a relative large number of cells . However , under culturing conditions widely used for C . difficile sporulation , as in BHI medium , supplemented or not with cysteine and yeast extract ( BHIS ) , the process is highly heterogeneous , or asynchronous [11] , [14] , [38] , [39] , reviewed by [40] ) . High titers of spores have been reported following 48 h incubation of liquid cultures in the Sporulation Medium ( or SM ) described by Wilson and co-authors [41] , but how the spore titer developed over time was not reported . More recently , SM was used , with some modifications to the original formulation , for high yield spore production on agar plates [42] . We determined the spore titer during growth of the wild type strain 630Δerm in liquid SM cultures . As shown in Figure 1A , no heat resistant spores could be detected at the time of inoculation , or during the first 10 hours of growth . Heat resistant spores , 3 . 7×102 spores/ml , were first detected at hour 12 , a titer that increased to 2 . 4×105 at hour 24 ( about 14 hours after entry into the stationary phase of growth ) , the later number corresponding to a percentage of sporulation of 0 . 3% ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) . From hour 24 onwards , the spore titer increased slowly , to reach 4 . 7×106 spores/ml 72 hours following inoculation , corresponding to 43 . 8% sporulation ( Figure 1A ) . Importantly , the percentage of sporulation in SM medium was higher than in BHI or BHIS for all the time points tested ( Figure S1 ) . In particular , the titer of spores in SM was two orders of magnitude higher than in BHIS , when measured 24 hours following inoculation ( Figure S1 ) . For our studies of spore morphogenesis and cell type-specific gene expression , SM was adopted . We then wanted to monitor progress through the morphological stages of sporulation by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy . In a first experiment , a sample from cultures of the wild type strain 630Δerm was collected 24 hours after inoculation into SM , for microscopic examination following staining with the lipophilic membrane dye FM4-64 and with the DNA marker DAPI . Cells representative of several distinctive morphological classes are shown on Figure 1B ( top ) . Cells with straight asymmetrically positioned septa ( class a ) and cells with curved spore membranes ( i . e . , at intermediate stages in the engulfment sequence; class b ) , both showing intense staining of the forespore DNA , were readily seen ( Figure 1B ) . Another class comprised cells showing strong uniform FM4-64 staining around the entire contour of the forespore ( Figure 1B ) . The staining pattern suggests that the forespore is entirely surrounded by a double membrane , and therefore that the engulfment sequence was finalized . Those cells in which the forespore shows a continuous , strong FM4-64 signal , but has not yet developed partial or full refractility are considered to have just completed the engulfment process , and define class c . A strong , condensed DAPI signal in the forespore was also seen for this class ( Figure 1B ) . Intense , uniform staining of the forespore by FM4-64 was maintained in cells carrying phase grey ( partially refractile ) or phase bright spores , defining class d ( Figure 1B ) . DAPI staining of the forespore DNA was variable for both cells with phase grey or phase bright spores in this class ( data not shown ) . Free spores , at least some of which could be stained with DAPI , define a last morphological class ( class e ) ( Figure 1B ) . The stages of sporulation discerned conform well to the sequence established for B . subtilis ( Figure 1B , bottom ) [15] , [21] , [37] . Staining of the developing spore by FM4-64 following engulfment completion contrasts with the situation in B . subtilis , in which the lipophilic dye does not label engulfed forespores [43] ( see also Figure S2A ) . However , in other organisms , FM4-64 stains the engulfed forespore [3] ( see also Text S1 ) . Also , FM4-64 does not stain free spores of B . subtilis ( which do not have and exosporium ) or B . cereus ( which are surrounded by an exosporium ) ( Figure S2B ) , but stains C . difficile spores ( which also possess an exosporium ) ( Figure S3 ) . Spore staining by FM4-64 may thus be more related to the composition of the surface layers , rather than to the presence of a specific structure . We note that affinity of FM dyes to the spore coats has been reported [3] ( see also Text S1 ) . Under our culturing conditions , cells belonging to each of the five morphological classes considered ( a to e ) were seen at all the time points examined ( Figure 1C ) . This suggests that sporulation is heterogeneous , or asynchronous , in agreement with other results [43] , with cells entering the sporulation pathway throughout the duration of the experiment . Surprisingly , the representation of cells at intermediate stages in development ( classes a to c ) decreased from hour 36 to hour 48 , without a corresponding rise in later morphological classes ( class d , phase grey/bright spores and class e , free spores ) ( Figure 1C ) . However , Live/Dead staining evidenced cell lysis , including of cells at intermediate stages of sporulation ( classes a to c ) , from hour 36 of growth onwards ( data not shown ) . As assessed by Live/Dead staining and fluorescence microscopy , lysis of sporulating cells was only marginal at hour 24 of growth ( data not shown ) . Therefore , in subsequent experiments , sporulating cells were scored 24 hours following inoculation . At hour 24 , the total number of sporulating cells ( i . e . , the sum of classes a to e in Figure 1C ) represents about 15% of the total cell population . The genes for the four cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors known to control gene expression during spore differentiation in B . subtilis are conserved in sporeformers [24]–[27] . Moreover , their operon structure and genomic context is also maintained ( Figure S4A ) . To investigate whether the function of the σF , σE , σG and σK factors is conserved , each of the corresponding genes was disrupted ( Figure S4 ) . For this purpose , type II introns were targeted to each of the sig genes , using the ClosTron system [44] . As shown in Figure S4A , re-targeting of the intron resulted in insertion after codon 153 of the sigF gene , codon 151 of sigE , codon 182 of sigG , and codon 34 of the 5′-end of the split sigK gene , interrupted by the skinCd element . Correct insertion of the intron was verified , in all cases , by PCR , and Southern blot analysis showed the presence of a single intron insertion in the genome of the different mutants ( Figure S4B through E ) . The sig mutants , along with the parental 630Δerm strain , were induced to sporulate in SM , and the titer of heat resistant spores assessed after 24 , 48 , and 72 hours of growth . For the wild type strain 630Δerm , the titer of spores was of 3×105 spores/ml at hour 24 , 2×106 spores/ml at hour 48 , and of 1×107 spores/ml at hour 72 ( Table 1 ) . In contrast , no heat resistant spores were found , at any time point tested , for the sigF ( AHCD533 ) , sigE ( AHCD532 ) , or sigG ( AHCD534 ) mutants . However , a titer of 103 heat resistant spores/ml of culture was found for the sigK mutant AHCD535 at hour 72 ( Table 1 ) . For complementation studies , we generated multicopy alleles of the sig genes , based on replicative plasmid pMTL84121 [45] , expressed from their native promoters ( the extent of the promoter fragments is shown in Figure S4A ) . Note that for complementation of the sigK mutation the two halves of the gene , together with a short skinCd element composed only of the putative recombinase gene ( spoIVCA , or CD12310 ) was used ( see below for a more detailed description on the complementation of the sigK mutation ) . When measured at hour 72 of growth in SM , the heat resistant spore titer was of 1 . 7×106 spores/ml for the wild type strain 630Δerm carrying the empty vector pMTL84121 . Derivatives of pMTL84121 carrying the sigF , sigE , sigG or sigK genes ( the later plasmid , pFT38 , with the short skinCd allele ) restored spore formation to the sig mutants , as assessed by microscopy ( Figure 2B ) . The same plasmids largely restored heat resistant spore formation to the sig mutants ( 1 . 6×104 , 8 . 3×105 , 3 . 9×105 , 4 . 8×105 spores/ml for the sigF , sigE , sigG , and sigK mutants , respectively , also measured at hour 72 of growth in SM ) . To establish the morphological phenotype of the various mutants we used phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy of samples collected from SM cultures at hour 24 , labeled with DAPI and FM4-64 ( Figure 2 ) . These studies revealed that the sigF and sigE mutants were blocked at the asymmetric division stage ( Figure 2A and C ) . As previously found for B . subtilis [37] , [46] , [47] both mutants formed abortive disporic forms , and occasionally multiple closely located polar septa ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , for the sigF mutant , small round cells were found , probably resulting from detachment of the forespore ( Figure 2A ) . In both mutants , the DNA stained strongly in the forespore ( s ) and gave a diffuse signal throughout the mother cell ( Figure 2A ) . TEM analysis confirmed the block at the asymmetric division stage for the two mutants ( Figure 2D ) . Cells of the sigG mutant completed the engulfment sequence , but did not proceed further in morphogenesis ( Figure 2A and C ) . As for class c in the wild type ( Figure 1B , and text above ) , the forespores in the sigG mutant stained strongly with FM4-64 ( Figure 2A ) . TEM of sporulating cells of the sigG mutant confirmed engulfment completion , but also revealed deposition of electrodense material around the forespore protoplast ( Figure 2D ) . This deposit could represent coat material . By comparison , no accumulation of electrodense coat-like material is seen by TEM around the engulfed forespore of a B . subtilis sigG mutant [48] . In this organism , coat assembly as discernible by TEM , is a late event that requires activation of σK in the mother cell [15] , [16] , [37] . Importantly , activation of σK is triggered by σG , and coincides with engulfment completion [49] , [50] . Therefore , the possible accumulation of coat material in the sigG mutant could imply that in C . difficile , σK is active independently of σG . We therefore wanted to test whether coat material was deposited around the forespore in the C . difficile sigG mutant . In B . subtilis , studies of protein localization have relied mainly on the use of translational fusions to the gfp gene , or its variants ( e . g . , [51] ) . However , an obstacle to the use of gfp or its derivatives in the anaerobe C . difficile , is that formation of the GFP fluorophore involves an oxidation reaction [52] . For this reason , we turned to the SNAP-tag reporter , which reacts with fluorescent derivatives of benzyl purine or pyrimidine substrates , and has been used in anaerobic bacteria [53] , [54] . We designed a variant of the SNAP26b gene , termed SNAPCd , codon-usage optimized for expression in C . difficile ( see Materials and Methods; see also Text S1 ) , and used it to construct C-terminal fusions of the SNAP-tag to spore coat proteins CotE and CotB [55] , [56] in plasmid pFT58 ( Figure S5B and C ) . The fusions were introduced , in a replicative plasmid , in strain 630Δerm and the sigG and sigK mutants , and samples from SM cultures at hour 24 were labeled with the cell-permeable fluorescent substrate TMR-Star ( see Materials and Methods ) . Using fluorescence microscopy and fluorimaging of SDS-PAGE-resolved whole cell extracts , no accumulation of CotE-SNAP was detected in cells of a sigK mutant , suggesting that the cotE gene is under the control of σK ( Figure 2E; see also below ) . CotB-SNAP , however , accumulated in cells of a sigK mutant ( Figure 2E ) , but not in cells of a sigE mutant ( data not shown ) , suggesting that expression of cotB is under the control of σE . Both CotE-SNAP and CotB-SNAP localized around the forespore in both wild type and in sigG cells ( Figure 2E ) . SDS-PAGE and fluorimaging suggested instability of CotB-SNAP for which several possible proteolytic fragments were detected , all of which larger that the SNAP domain ( Figure 2E ) . That no release of a labeled SNAP domain was detected for either protein implies that the localized fluorescence signal is largely due to the fusion proteins . Thus , both early ( CotB ) and late ( CotE ) coat proteins are assembled around the forespore in cells of a sigG mutant . In all , the results suggest that σK is active independently of σG , and thus , that the later regulatory protein is not a strict requirement for deposition of at least some coat in C . difficile . Phase contrast microscopy revealed the presence of some phase bright or partially phase bright spores in SM cultures of the sigK mutant , although free spores were only rarely seen ( Figure 2A ) . The ellipsoidal spores were often positioned slightly tilted relative to the longitudinal axis of the mother cell ( Figure 2 and 3 ) . The appearance of phase bright spores normally correlates with synthesis of the spore cortex PG , and the development of spore heat resistance [37] , [57] , in line with the finding that the sigK mutant formed heat resistant spores ( above ) . TEM revealed the presence of a cortex layer in cells of the sigK mutant , supporting the inferences drawn on the basis of the phase contrast microscopy and heat resistance assays ( Figure 2A to E ) . The number of phase bright or phase grey spores by phase contrast microscopy , was 3 . 2% of the total number of cells scored at hour 24 of growth in liquid SM ( Figure 2C ) . This is higher than the percentage of sporulation , 0 . 03% , measured by heat resistance ( Table 1 ) . Because full heat resistance requires synthesis of most of the cortex structure , this observation suggests that a large number of the spores formed have an incomplete or dysfunctional cortex . However , we cannot discard the possibility that spores of the mutant are deficient in germination . In any event , unlike in B . subtilis , where a sigK mutant is unable to form the spore cortex [37] , [57] , σK is not obligatory for the biogenesis of this structure in C . difficile . In contrast , the TEM analysis did not reveal deposition of coat material around the cortex in cells of the sigK mutant ( Figure 2D ) . Although coat assembly most likely starts early , under the control of σE ( [15] , [16] , [42]; above ) the TEM data , together with the data on assembly of CotE ( Figure 2E ) , suggest that the late stages in the assembly of the coats are under σK control . That free spores were only rarely seen for the sigK mutant , prompted us to test whether σK could have a role in mother cell lysis , using a Live/Dead stain and fluorescence microscopy . In the wild type strain 630Δerm , development of refractility coincided with loss of viability of the mother cell ( strong staining with propidium iodide ) and strong staining of the developing spore with the Syto 9 dye ( Figure 3A ) , [58] . In contrast , the mother cell remained viable in the sigK mutant ( strong staining with Syto 9 ) ( Figure 3A and B ) , and the spores stained only weakly with the Syto 9 dye . Lastly , our complementation analysis of the sigK mutant provided additional functional insight . While wild type levels of sporulation could be restored to a sigK mutant by a copy of the sigK gene bearing a deletion of all the genes within the skinCd element but the recombinase gene ( Figure 3C; see above ) , an uninterrupted copy of the gene , in plasmid pFT42 , did not restore sporulation ( Figure 3C and D ) . An earlier study has suggested that the absence of skinCd correlates with a sporulation defect and that a skinCd- allele of sigK is dominant over the wild type [39] . Our results support the view that generation of an intact sigK gene through SpoIVCA-mediated excision of the skinCd element is essential for sporulation . Moreover , we found that introduction of the multicopy skin-less allele in strain 630Δerm blocked sporulation at an early stage , as no asymmetrically positioned septa could be seen in the transformed strain ( Figure 3E ) . The results suggest that the absence of skinCd allows the production of active σK in pre-divisional cells , and that active σK interferes with the events leading to asymmetric septation in C . difficile . Having established the main features of sporulation under our culturing conditions , as well as the phenotypes associated with disruption of the sig genes , we next wanted to examine cell type-specific gene expression in relation to the course of morphogenesis . As a first step , we examined the expression of the genes coding for σF , σE , σG , and σK using the SNAPCd cassette as a transcriptional reporter . In control experiments , detailed in Text S1 , in which expression of SNAPCd was placed under the control of the anhydrotetracycline-inducible promoter Ptet ( Figure S5A ) [59] , we showed that complete labeling of all the SNAP produced could be achieved; furthermore , no background was detected for non-induced but labeled cells , or for unlabeled cells producing the SNAP reporter , by either fluorescence microscopy or the combination of fluorimaging and immunobloting with an anti-SNAP antibody , of SDS-PAGE resolved whole cell extracts ( Figure S6 ) . The promoter regions of sigF , sigE , sigG , and sigK genes were cloned in the SNAPCd-containing promoter probe vector pFT47 ( Figure S5B ) . The upstream boundaries of the promoter fragments fused to SNAPCd coincide with the 5′-end of the fragments used for the successful complementation of the various sig mutants ( Figure 3C and S4A; see above ) . To monitor the production of SNAP during C . difficile sporulation , samples of cultures expressing each of the promoter fusions were collected at 24 h of growth in SM medium , and the cells doubly labeled with TMR-Star and the membrane dye MTG , to allow identification of the different stages of sporulation . These were defined based on Figure 1B , with the addition of a class of pre-divisional cells ( no signs of asymmetric division ) . Expression of the various Psig-SNAPCd transcriptional fusions could thus be correlated to the stage in spore morphogenesis . Expression of both sigF and sigE was first detected in pre-divisional cells of the wild type strain 630Δerm , but not in cells of a spo0A mutant ( Figure 4 ) , consistent with previous reports [60]–[62] ( Figure S7A and B ) . Both genes continued to be expressed following asymmetric division , in the forespore and the mother cell of both the wild type , and the sigF or sigE mutants ( Figure 4 ) . In these experiments , complete labeling of the SNAP protein was achieved , as revealed by fluorimaging and immunobloting of SDS-PAGE resolved proteins in whole cell extracts ( Figure 5A ) . Quantification of the fluorescence signal shows that while for sigF the average intensity did not differ much between forespores ( 1 . 8±0 . 5 ) , and mother cells ( 1 . 8±0 . 5 ) , it increased in both the forespore and the mother cell relative to pre-divisional cells ( average signal , 1 . 5±0 . 4 ) ( p<0 . 01 ) . Transcription of sigE , in turn , was lower in the forespore ( average signal , 0 . 8±0 . 3 ) as compared to pre-divisional cells ( 1 . 0±0 . 3 ) or the mother cell ( 1 . 0±0 . 3 ) ( p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , transcription of sigE , seems to occur preferentially in the mother cell . Transcription of both sigF and sigE persisted in both the forespore and the mother cell until a late stage of sporulation , when the forespore becomes phase bright ( Figure 4 ) . In contrast to sigF and sigE , transcription of sigG and sigK was confined to the forespore and to the mother cell , respectively ( Figure 4 ) . Transcription of sigG is detected in the forespore just after asymmetric division , consistent with the presence of a σF-type promoter in its regulatory region ( Figure S7C ) . In agreement with this inference , expression of PsigG-SNAPCd was not detected in cells of a sigF mutant ( Figure 4 ) . Transcription of sigG was detected until the development of spore refractility ( Figure 4 ) . Fluorimaging and immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts shows that under the conditions used , all of the SNAP protein detected was labeled ( Figure 5A ) . In B . subtilis , σF initiates transcription of sigG in the forespore [48] , [63] . However , transcription of sigG also depends on σE , by an unknown mechanism [64] . In contrast , forespore-specific expression of PsigG-SNAPCd was detected in most cells ( 82% ) of a sigE mutant ( Figure 4 ) . In B . subtilis , the main period of sigG transcription takes place following engulfment completion , and relies on a positive auto-regulatory loop [65] . We detected transcription of sigG both prior and following engulfment completion in a sigG mutant ( Figure 4 ) . However , the quantitative analysis of the SNAP-TMR signal shows an increase in the average fluorescence intensity following engulfment completion ( classes c+d , 2 . 6±1 . 0 as opposed to 2 . 2±0 . 9 for classes a+b ) ( p<0 . 01 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Moreover , the average fluorescence signal for engulfed forespores of a sigG mutant suffered a higher reduction compared to the wild type ( classes c+d , 1 . 9±0 . 7 for the mutant as compared to 2 . 6±1 . 0 for the wild type; p<0 . 01 ) , than did the signal for pre-engulfment forespores of the mutant ( classes a+b , 1 . 7±0 . 5 as opposed to 2 . 2±0 . 9; p<0 . 05 ) ( Figure 5B ) . While evidencing that σG contributes to transcription of its own gene both prior to and following engulfment completion , these results suggest that the auto-regulatory effect is stronger at the later stage . In C . difficile , transcription of sigK was confined to the mother cell and detected soon after asymmetric division ( Figure 4 ) . Moreover , disruption of sigE resulted in undetected expression of PsigK-SNAPCd ( Figure 4 ) . Together , the results suggest that the initial transcription of sigK is activated by σE in the mother cell , consistent with the presence of a possible σE-recognized promoter in the sigK regulatory region ( Figure S7D ) . Interestingly , transcription of the sigK gene was also detected in a small percentage ( 9% ) of the sporulating cells of a sigF mutant ( Figure 4 ) . This was unexpected because in B . subtilis , activation of σE in the mother cell is dependent on σF [66] , [67] . This observation thus raises the possibility that the activation of σE in C . difficile is at least partially independent of σF ( see also the following section ) . Transcription of sigK was also detected following engulfment completion , in cells carrying phase grey and phase bright spores ( Figure 4 ) . As shown in Figure 5A , all of the SNAP produced from the PsigK-SNAPCd fusion was , under our experimental conditions , labeled . The average intensity of the fluorescence signal from PsigK-SNAPCd in cells prior ( classes a+b , 0 . 6±0 . 1 ) and after engulfment completion ( class c , 0 . 7±0 . 2 ) was very close . However , expression was significantly increased for those cells that carried phase bright spores ( class d , 1 . 4±0 . 8; p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 5B ) . This suggests that the onset of the main period of sigK transcription coincides with the final stages in spore morphogenesis . Lastly , under our experimental conditions , we found no evidence for auto-regulation of sigK transcription , as expression of PsigK-SNAPCd was not curtailed by mutation of sigK at any morphological stage analyzed ( Figure 4 and data not shown ) . To investigate the genetic dependencies for sigma factor activity during sporulation in C . difficile , we used transcriptional SNAPCd fusions to promoters under the control of each cell type-specific sigma factor . These promoters were selected on the basis of qRT-PCR experiments and the presence on their regulatory regions , of sequences conforming well to the consensus for promoter recognition by the sporulation sigma factors of B . subtilis [68] ( Figure S8 ) . The gpr gene of B . subtilis codes for a spore-specific protease required for degradation of the DNA-protecting small acid-soluble spore proteins ( SASP ) during spore germination ( [1]; see also below ) . Even though this gene is under the dual control of σF and σG in B . subtilis , the C . difficille orthologue of gpr ( CD2470 ) was chosen as a reporter for σF activity ( Figure S8A ) . First , qRT-PCR showed that transcription of the C . difficille orthologue ( CD2470 ) was severely reduced in a sigF mutant ( Figure 6A ) . Secondly , expression of a Pgpr-SNAPCd fusion , monitored by fluorescence microscopy , was confined to the forespore and detected soon after asymmetric division in 66% of the cells that were at this stage of sporulation ( Figure 6B ) . Lastly , expression was eliminated by disruption of the sigF gene but detected in 99% of the cells of the sigG mutant ( compared for the wild type at the same stage , i . e . , 95% ) ( Figure 6B ) . This suggests that σG does not contribute significantly to gpr expression . Forespore-specific expression of Pgpr-SNAPCd was also detected following engulfment completion ( Figure 6B ) . Therefore , in spite of expression of the sigF gene in both the forespore and the mother cell , σF is active exclusively in the forespore . In these experiments , all of the SNAP protein produced from Pgpr-SNAPCd was labeled with the TMR-Star substrate ( Figure 7A ) . A quantitative analysis of the fluorescence signal from Pgpr-SNAPCd showed no significant difference between cells before ( average signal for classes a+b , 2 . 0±0 . 5 ) or after engulfment completion ( classes c+d , 1 . 9±0 . 7 ) ( Figure 7B ) . This suggests that σF is active in the forespore throughout development . To monitor the activity of σE , we examined expression of the first gene , spoIIIAA , of the spoIIIA operon . This operon is under the control of σE in B . subtilis [69]–[71] and sequences that conform well to the consensus for promoter recognition by B . subtilis σE are found just upstream of the C . difficile spoIIIAA gene ( or CD1192 ) ( Figure S8B ) . The qRT-PCR experiments showed that expression of spoIIIAA was much more severely affected by a mutation in sigE than by disruption of sigF ( Figure 6A ) . While consistent with a direct control of spoIIIAA by σE , this observation adds to the evidence suggesting that unlike in B . subtilis [21] , [66] , [67] , the activity of σE is at least partially independent on the prior activation of σF ( as also hinted by the observation that transcription of the sigK gene , abolished by mutation of sigE , was still detected in a fraction of cells of a sigF mutant; above ) . If so , then expression of a PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd fusion should be confined to the mother cell , dependent on sigE , but partially independent on sigF . PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd-driven SNAP production was indeed confined to the mother cell , detected just after asymmetric division in 89% of the cells scored at this stage of sporulation , eliminated by mutation of sigE , but still detected ( in the mother cell ) in 21% of sigF cells ( Figure 6B ) . Labeling of the SNAP protein produced from the PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd fusion was quantitative ( Figure 7A ) , and the quantitative analysis of the average fluorescence signal shows no significant difference in expression levels before or after engulfment completion ( Figure 7B ) . PspoIIIAA-SNAPCd expression persisted until late stages in development , and was still detected for cells in which phase bright spores were seen ( Figure 7B ) . The sspA gene of B . subtilis codes for a small acid-soluble spore protein ( SASP ) that , together with other SASP family members , binds to and protects the spore DNA [1] . Expression of sspA in B . subtilis is controlled by σG [68] , [69] , and a σG-type promoter can be recognized upstream of the C . difficile orthologue ( CD2688 ) ( Figure S8C ) . Unexpectedly , a mutation in sigF caused a greater decrease in sspA transcription than disruption of sigE or sigG , in our qRT-PCR analysis ( Figure 6A ) . While not excluding a contribution of σF to the expression of sspA , this result may be affected by the lack of synchronization of sporulation in the liquid SM cultures . Consistent with σG control of sspA in C difficile , PsspA-driven SNAP production was confined to the forespore and eliminated by disruption of sigF or of sigG ( but not of sigE or sigK ) ( Figure 6B ) . This is in agreement with the requirement for σF for the transcription of sigG ( above ) , and seems to exclude a contribution of σF for sspA transcription as suggested by the qRT-PCR analysis . sspA expression was detected in 50% of the cells that had just completed asymmetric division , but also throughout the engulfment sequence ( 72% of the cells ) , following engulfment completion ( 85% of the cells scored ) , and in cells ( 75% ) carrying phase bright spores ( Figure 6B ) . Our analysis of sigG transcription suggested that it increased following engulfment completion , with a stronger auto-regulatory component than in pre-engulfed cells ( above ) . In B . subtilis , continued transcription in the forespore when ( upon engulfment completion ) it becomes isolated from the surrounding medium , requires the activity of σE [72]–[76] . To determine whether the activity of σG increased following engulfment completion in a manner that required σE , we quantified the SNAP-TMR signal in cells expressing PsspA-SNAPCd . Control experiments showed that all the SNAP protein produced from the PsspA-SNAPCd fusion was labeled with the TMR-Star substrate ( Figure 7A ) . The average intensity of the SNAP-TMR signal increased from 1 . 6±0 . 5 before engulfment completion ( classes a+b ) to 2 . 1±04 , following engulfment completion ( classes c+d ) ( p<0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 7B ) . This result is consistent with the analysis of sigG transcription ( above ) and indicates that the activity of σG increases following engulfment completion . Importantly , even though sspA expression was found for 61% of the sigE mutant cells , disruption of sigE reduced the average fluorescence signal in the forespore ( 1 . 6±0 . 7 ) to the level seen before engulfment completion for the wild type ( 1 . 6±0 . 5 ) . We conclude that disruption of sigE does not prevent activity of σG prior to engulfment completion . Finally , to monitor the activity of σK , we examined expression of the cotE gene , coding for an abundant spore coat protein in C . difficile [55] . This gene has no counterpart in B . subtilis , but as shown above , production of a CotE-SNAP translational fusion was dependent on σK ( Figure 2E ) and a sequence that conforms well to the consensus for σK promoters of B . subtilis can be recognized in its promoter region ( Figure S8D ) . qRT-PCR experiments show that disruption of the sigE and sigK genes caused a much stronger reduction in the expression of cotE than mutations in sigF or sigG ( Figure 6A ) . While not excluding a contribution from σE , the qRT-PCR data are in line with the interpretation that the main regulator of cotE expression is σK ( with σE driving production of σK ) . We note that the reduced effect of the sigF mutation on cotE expression is in agreement with the view that σE production is partially independent on σF , as discussed above . We also note that the reduced effect of the sigG mutation on cotE expression is in agreement with the morphological analysis and the data on the assembly of the CotE-SNAP fusion ( Figure 2D and E ) , suggesting σK-dependent deposition of coat material independently of σG . Fluorescence microscopy reveals that expression of PcotE-SNAPCd is confined to the mother cell ( Figure 6B ) . However , expression of PcotE-SNAPCd was found just after asymmetric division in only 2% of the cells , and during engulfment in only 10% of the cells ( Figure 6B ) . Expression increased to 66% of the cells after engulfment completion , and to 88% of the cells that showed phase bright spores ( Figure 6B ) . Expression of PcotE-SNAPCd was eliminated by disruption of sigE , but retained in 3% of the sporulating cells of a sigF mutant ( Figure 6B ) . This is consistent with data presented above , also in line with the inference that the activity of σK is partially independent on sigF ( Figure 6A and B ) . Moreover , 66% of the cells of a sigG mutant that had completed the engulfment process ( as illustrated in Figure 6B ) showed expression of the reporter fusion , again suggesting σK activity independently of σG . Interestingly , disruption of sigK did not abolish expression of the fusion , which was detected in 90% of the sporulating cells , but at low levels ( Figure 6B ) . This raises the possibility that σE is responsible for the few cells that produce the reporter prior to engulfment completion . To test these possibilities quantitatively , we first verified that all the SNAP-tag produced from the PcotE-SNAPCd fusion was labeled , under our experimental conditions ( Figure 7A ) . The average intensity of the SNAP-TMR signal was of 0 . 6±0 . 1 for cells of the wild type strain prior to engulfment completion ( classes a+b ) , of 1 . 2±0 . 8 for those that had just completed engulfment ( class c ) , and of 3 . 3±1 . 1 for cells with phase bright spores ( class d ) ( Figure 7B ) . Inactivation of sigG did not affect the expression level of the fusion prior to engulfment completion ( classes a+b for the sigG mutant , average signal , 0 . 6±0 . 1 ) , nor did it prevent expression following engulfment completion ( class c of the sigG mutant , 1 . 3±0 . 8 ) ( Figure 7B ) . However , the average fluorescence signal for all classes of the sigG mutant ( 1 . 3±0 . 8 ) is significantly lower than the average for all classes of the wild type ( 1 . 9±1 . 3 ) ( p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 7B ) . Finally , the average fluorescence signal for all cells of the sigK mutant was lower ( 0 . 3±0 . 1 ) than for pre-engulfment cells of the wild type ( classes a+b , 0 . 6±0 . 1 ) ( p<0 . 0001 ) , suggesting that both σE and σK contribute to expression of the reporter fusion in these cells . Together , these data suggest that the main period of σK activity is delayed relative to engulfment completion , and coincides with development of spore refractility .
The cytological and TEM analysis shows that the sigF and sigE mutants are arrested just after asymmetric division . It follows that σF and σE control early stages of development in C . difficile , consistent with the function of these sigma factors in B . subtilis . Disruption of sigE also arrested development just after asymmetric division in C . perfringens [29] . In contrast , disruption of either the sigF or sigE genes in C . acetobutylicum blocks sporulation prior to asymmetric division [31] , [33] . In C . difficile , expression of both sigF and sigE commenced in predivisional cells , in line with work showing that expression of the sigF-containing operon ( also coding for two other proteins , SpoIIAA and SpoIIAB , that control σF ) occurs from a σH and Spo0A-controlled promoter , and with the observation that transcription of sigE is activated from a σA-type promoter to which Spo0A also binds [60] , [61] . In B . subtilis , following asymmetric septation , Spo0A becomes a cell-specific transcription factor , active predominantly in the mother cell [77] . This may also be the case in C . difficile , because transcription of sigE increased in the mother cell , relative to the forespore , following asymmetric division ( Figure 7B ) . In B . subtilis , σF is held in an inactive complex by the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB [21] , [23] . The reaction that releases σF takes place specifically in the forespore , soon after septation , and involves the anti-anti sigma factor SpoIIAA and the SpoIIE phosphatase . SpoIIAB , SpoIIAA and SpoIIE are produced in the C . difficile predivisional cell under Spo0A control [24]–[27] , [60] , [61] . Because the activity of σF was confined to the forespore , we presume that the pathway leading to the forespore-specific activation of this sigma factor is also conserved . In C . acetobutylicum , this pathway may lead to σF activation in pre-divisional cells , as disruption of sigF or spoIIE blocks sporulation prior to asymmetric division [33] , [35] . In B . subtilis , σE is also synthesized in the predivisional but as an inactive pro-protein [21] , [23] . Processing of pro-σE in the mother cell requires activation of the SpoIIGA protease by SpoIIR , a σF-controlled signaling protein secreted from the forespore [66] , [67] . Hence , the activity of σE requires the prior activation of σF . In C . difficile , the activity of σE was also restricted to the mother cell ( Figure 7B ) . Because σE of C . difficile bears , like its B . subtilis counterpart , a pro sequence , and because the SpoIIGA protease and SpoIIR are conserved [24]–[27] , the σE activation pathway also seems conserved . Strikingly however , both the qRT-PCR and the SNAP labeling experiments showed that the activity of σE is at least partially independent on σF ( Figure 6 ) . We do not know whether production of SpoIIR is also partially independent on σF . However , in C . acetobutylicum , in which σF is activated ( and required ) prior to asymmetric septation [33] , [35] , production of SpoIIR is , at least in part , independent of σF [33] . The cytological and TEM analysis showed that a sigG mutant completes the engulfment sequence , suggesting that σG is mainly required for late stages in development , consistent with its role in B . subtilis . Disruption of sigG also causes a late morphological block in C . acetobutylicum [78] . In B . subtilis , the forespore-specific transcription of sigG is initiated by σF but is delayed , relative to other σF-dependent genes , towards the engulfment sequence [21] , [64] , [68] , [69] . Moreover , the activity of σE , in the mother cell , is required for transcription of sigG [21] , [64] . In contrast , transcription of sigG in C . difficile , was detected soon after asymmetric septation , and was not dependent on σE ( Figure 4 and 5 ) . Transcription of sigG also appears to be independent of sigE in C . perfringens [29] . The main period of sigG transcription in B . subtilis relies on an auto-regulatory loop activated coincidently with engulfment completion [65] . Therefore , the main period of σG activity coincides with engulfment completion . At least the anti-sigma factor CsfB ( σF-controlled ) appears important for impeding the σG auto-regulatory loop from functioning prior to engulfment completion , the main period of activity of the preceding forespore sigma factor , σF [21] , [23] , [72] , [79] , [80] . CsfB is absent from C . difficile as well as from other Clostridia [24] , [25] , [27] . In C . difficile , not only is transcription of sigG observed soon after asymmetric division , but the activity of σG , is also detected prior to engulfment completion . Nevertheless , our analysis indicates that σG activity increases following engulfment completion . In addition , our results suggest that σG is auto-regulatory both before , and more markedly , following engulfment completion . A universal feature of endosporulation is the isolation of the forespore , surrounded by two membranes , from the external medium at the end of the engulfment sequence . In B . subtilis , the 8 mother cell proteins encoded by the spoIIIA operon , which localize to the forespore outer membrane , and the forespore-specific SpoIIQ protein , which localizes to the forespore inner membrane , are involved in the assembly of a specialized secretion system that links the cytoplasm of the two cells [72]–[76] . Recent work has shown that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ secretion system functions as a feeding tube required for continued macromolecular synthesis in the engulfed forespore [76] . Mutation of sigE reduced the activity of σG but because the mutant is blocked at an early stage , we do not presently know whether σE is required for σG activity in the engulfed forespore . The SpoIIIAH and SpoIIQ proteins also facilitate forespore engulfment in B . subtilis [81] . The spoIIIA operon is conserved in sporeformers [24] , [25] , [27] , and spoIIIA is under σE control in C . difficile ( this work ) . A gene , CD0125 , coding for a LytM-containing protein ( as the B . subtilis SpoIIQ protein ) may represent a non-orthologous gene replacement of spoIIQ [24] . We do not yet know whether spoIIIA and CD0125 are essential for sporulation in C . difficile and if so , whether they are required for engulfment and/or continued gene expression in the engulfed forespore . The TEM analysis shows that the sigK mutant of C . difficile lacks a visible coat ( Figure 2D ) . However , as in B . subtilis [15] , [16] assembly of the coat begins with σE , as suggested by the forespore localization of CotB-SNAP in cells of the sigK mutant , and supported by recent work on the analysis of coat morphogenetic proteins SpoIVA and SipL [42] . Most likely , σK controls the final stages in the assembly of the spore surface structures , including the coat and exosporium . However , σK is not a strict requirement for the formation of heat resistant spores ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ) , and we presume that σE and σG ( see above ) are largely responsible for synthesis of the spore cortex . Final assembly of the coat together with the role of C . difficile σK in mother cell autolysis , are functions shared with its B . subtilis counterpart . Transcription and activity of the C . difficile sigK gene was dependent on sigE , and was detected at low levels prior to engulfment completion . However , both transcription and activity increased , following engulfment completion , coincidently with the appearance of phase grey and phase bright spores . Transcription of the sigK and spoIVCA genes of B . subtilis , the latter coding for the recombinase that excises the skin element , is initiated under the control of σE with the assistance of the regulatory protein SpoIIID , and is delayed relative to a first wave of σE-directed genes [21] , [23] , [69] , [70] . SpoIIID is conserved in C . difficile [27] and it may only accumulate to levels sufficient to enhance sigK and spoIVCA transcription at late stages in morphogenesis . Two observations highlight the importance of the skin element in C . difficile . First , with the exception of an asporogenous strain of C . tetani , the skin element is not present in other Clostridial species [17] , [39] . Second , not only a skin-less allele of sigK fails to complement a sigK mutation but also acts as a dominant negative mutation [39] , blocking entry into sporulation ( Figure 3D and E ) ( while these results seem to imply that σK is auto-regulatory , we did not detect auto-regulation of sigK in our single cell analysis ) . Absence of the skin element may allow the recruitment of σK for other functions . In C . perfringens and in C . botulinum , σK is produced in pre-divisional cells , and is involved in enterotoxin production in the first , and in cold and osmotic stress tolerance in the second [29] , [82] . A key finding of the present study is that contrary to B . subtilis , sigG is not essential for the activity of σK . In B . subtilis a signaling protein , SpoIVB , secreted from the forespore activates the pro-σK processing protease SpoIVFB , which is kept inactive in a complex with BofA and SpoIVFA , embedded in the forespore outer membrane [21] , [22] . SpoIVFB , BofA and possibly also SpoIVFA are absent from C . difficile , suggesting that the σG to σK pathway is absent and consistent with the lack of a pro-sequence [24] , [27] , [36] . However , C . difficile codes for two orthologues of SpoIVB [24] , [25] , [27] . Mutations that bypass the need for sigG or spoIVB in B . subtilis result in coat deposition , but not cortex formation , phenocopying the sigG mutant of C . difficile [50] . In B . subtilis , SpoIVB is also required for the engulfment-regulated proteolysis of SpoIIQ [83] . The C . difficile SpoIVB orthologues may be involved in cortex formation and/or proteolysis of CD0125 ( above ) . While the activity of σK did not require σG , our data shows that mutation of sigG reduced the activity of σK at late stages of spore morphogenesis . Because the sigG mutant fails to form phase grey/bright spores , we do not presently know if a forespore-mother cell signaling operates at this stage , or whether the late stages in spore morphogenesis serve as a cue for enhanced activity of σK . We show that the main periods of activity of the four cell type-specific sigma factors of C . difficile are conserved , relative to the B . subtilis model , with σF and σE controlling early stages of development and σG and σK governing late developmental events ( Figure 8A and B ) . However , the fact that the activity of σE was partially independent of σF , and that σG or σK did not require σE or σG , respectively , seems to imply a weaker connection between the forespore and mother cell lines of gene expression . In spite of the important differences in the roles of the sporulation sigma factors and the regulatory circuits leading to their activation ( Figure 8A and B ) , overall , in what concerns the genetic control of sporulation , C . difficile seems closer to the model organism B . subtilis than the other Clostridial species that have been studied . Differences in the function/period of activity of the sporulation sigma factors in other Clostridial species , may be related to the coordination of solventogenesis , toxin production or other functions with sporulation [28]–[35] . We note however that the relationship between toxinogenesis and spore formation in C . difficile is still unclear [13] , [60] . Together with the accompanying work of Saujet and co-authors [62] , our study provides the first comprehensive description of spore morphogenesis in relation to cell type-specific gene expression in a Clostridial species that is also an important human pathogen . The two studies establish a platform for analyzing the control of toxin production in relation to C . difficile sporulation , and for the functional characterization of genes predicted to be important for spore functions related to host colonization , spore germination , recurrent sporulation in the host , and spore dissemination .
Bacterial strains and their relevant properties are listed in Table S2 . The Escherichia coli strain DH5α ( Bethesda Research laboratories ) was used for molecular cloning . Luria-Bertani medium was routinely used for growth and maintenance of E . coli and B . subtilis . The B . subtilis strains are congenic derivatives of the Spo+ strain MB24 ( trpC2 metC3 ) . Sporulation of B . subtilis was induced by growth and exhaustion in Difco sporulation medium ( DSM ) [84] . When indicated , ampicillin ( 100 µg/ml ) or chloramphenicol ( 15 µg/ml ) was added to the culture medium . The C . difficile strains used in this study are congenic derivatives of the wild type strain 630Δerm [85] and were routinely grown anaerobically ( 5% H2 , 15% CO2 , 80% N2 ) at 37°C in brain heart infusion ( BHI ) medium ( Difco ) , BHIS [BHI medium supplemented with yeast extract ( 5 mg/ml ) and L-cysteine ( 0 . 1% ) , or SM medium ( for 1l: 90 g Bacto-tryptone , 5 g Bacto-peptone , 1 g ( NH4 ) 2SO4 and 1 . 5 g Tris base ) ] [41] . Sporulation assays were performed in SM medium [41] . When necessary , cefoxitin ( 25 µg/ml ) , thiamphenicol ( 15 µg/ml ) , or erythromycin ( 5 µg/ml ) was added to C . difficile cultures . Overnight cultures grown at 37°C in BHI were used to inoculate SM medium ( at a dilution of 1∶200 ) . At specific time points , 1 ml of culture was withdrawn , serially diluted in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS; 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM Phosphate , 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , and plated before and after heat treatment ( 30 min at 60°C ) , to determine the total and heat-resistant colony forming units ( CFU ) . The samples were plated onto BHI plates supplemented with 0 . 1% taurocholate ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , to promote efficient spore germination [41] . The percentage of sporulation was determined as the ratio between the number of spores/ml and the total number of bacteria/ml times 100 . In a preliminary set of experiments , we defined the time for which the difference in expression of a selected σ target gene between the wild type and the corresponding mutant strain was highest . To study σE- or σF-dependent control , we harvested cells from 630Δerm , sigF and sigE mutants after 14 h of growth in SM medium . Strain 630Δerm and the sigG or the sigK mutants were harvested after 19 h ( 630Δerm , sigG mutant ) and 24 h ( 630Δerm , sigK mutant ) of growth in SM medium . Total RNA was extracted from at least two independent cultures . After centrifugation , the culture pellets were resuspended in RNApro solution ( MP Biomedicals ) and RNA extracted using the FastRNA Pro Blue Kit , according to the manufacturer's instructions . The RNA quality was determined using RNA 6000 Nano Reagents ( Agilent ) . For quantitative RT-PCR experiments , 1 µg of total RNA was heated at 70°C for 10 min along with 1 µg of hexamer oligonucleotide primers p ( dN ) 6 ( Roche ) . After slow cooling , cDNAs were synthesized as previously described [61] . The reverse transcriptase was inactivated by incubation at 85°C for 5 min . Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed twice in a 20 µl reaction volume containing 20 ng of cDNAs , 10 µl of FastStart SYBR Green Master mix ( ROX , Roche ) and 200 nM gene-specific primers in a AB7300 real-time PCR instrument ( Applied Biosystems ) . The primers used for each marker are listed in Table S3 . Amplification and detection were performed as previously described [61] . In each sample , the quantity of cDNAs of a gene was normalized to the quantity of cDNAs of the DNApolIII gene . The relative transcript changes were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method as described [61] . The construction of transcriptional fusions of the promoters for the sigF , sigE , sigG and sigK genes , as well as the construction of translational fusions of cotB and cotE to the SNAP-tag [86] is described in detail in Text S1 . In these plasmids , listed in Table S4 , we used a synthetic SNAP cassette , codon usage optimized for C . difficile ( DNA 2 . 0 , Menlo Park , CA ) , which we termed SNAPCd ( the sequence is available for download at www . itqb . unl . pt/~aoh/SNAPCdDNAseq . docx ) . Whole cell extracts were obtained by withdrawing 10 ml samples from C . difficile cultures in brain heart infusion ( BHI ) for the Ptet-SNAP-bearing strains , or in SM medium for the sporulation experiments , at the desired times . The extracts were prepared immediately following labeling with 250 nM of the TMR-Star substrate ( New England Biolabs ) , for 30 min in the dark . Following labeling , the cells were collected by centrifugation ( 4000×g , for 5 min at 4°C ) , the cell sediment was washed with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and resuspended in 1 ml French press buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 10 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 2 mM NaCl , 10% Glycerol , 1 mM PMSF ) . The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell ( 18000 lb/in2 ) . Proteins in the extracts were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE gels . The gels were first scanned in a Fuji TLA-5100 fluorimager , and then subject to immunoblot analysis as described before [65] . The anti-SNAP antibody ( New England Biolabs ) was used at a 1∶1000 dilution , and a rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase ( Sigma ) was used at dilution 1∶10000 . The immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Samples of 1 ml were withdrawn from BHI or SM cultures at the desired times following inoculation , and the cells collected by centrifugation ( 4000×g for 5 min ) . The cells were washed with 1 ml of PBS , and ressuspended in 0 . 1 ml of PBS supplemented with the lipophilic styryl membrane dye N- ( 3-triethylammoniumprpyl ) -4- ( p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl ) pyridinium dibromide ( FM4-64; 10 µg . ml−1 ) [43] , [87] , and the DNA stain DAPI ( 4′ , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 50 µg . ml−1 ) ( both from Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) . For the live/dead assay , samples were collected as described above , ressuspended in 0 . 05 ml of PBS and mixed with an equal volume of 2× LIVE/DEAD BacLight 2× staining reagent mixture ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) containing Propidium iodide ( 30 µM final concentration ) and syto9 ( 6 µM final concentration ) . For SNAP labeling experiments , cells in culture samples were labeled with TMR-Star ( as above ) , collected by centrifugation ( 4000×g , 3 min , at room temperature ) , washed four times with 1 ml of PBS , and finally ressuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing the membrane dye Mitotracker Green ( 0 . 5 µg . ml−1 ) ( Molecular Probes , Invitrogen ) . For phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy , cells were mounted on 1 . 7% agarose coated glass slides and observed on a Leica DM6000B microscope equipped with a phase contrast Uplan F1 100× objective and a CCD Ixon camera ( Andor Technologies ) [65] . Images were acquired and analyzed using the Metamorph software suite version 5 . 8 ( Universal Imaging ) , and adjusted and cropped using ImageJ ( http://rsbweb . nih . gov/ij/ ) . Exposure times were adjusted and defined for each SNAP transcriptional or translational fusion analyzed . For quantification of the SNAPCd signal resulting from transcriptional fusions , 6×6 pixel regions were defined in the desired cell and the average pixel intensity was calculated , and corrected by subtracting the average pixel intensity of the background . Small fluctuations of fluorescence among different fields were corrected by normalizing to the average pixel intensity obtained for the intrinsic autofluorescence of C . difficile cells [88] . Statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism ( Version 6 . 0; GraphPad Software Inc . ) . The non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( KS-test ) was applied to compare distributions obtained from quantifications of the SNAP-TMR signal . The P-value is indicated for all comparisons whose differences were found to be statistically significant . Although the results presented are from a single experiment , all experiments involving quantification of a fluorescence signal were performed independently three times and only results that were considered statistically significant by a KS-test in all three experiments were considered to be statistically relevant . For transmission electron microscopy electron ( TEM ) analysis , cells of the wild type 630Δerm strains and of the various sig mutants were collected at various times following inoculation onto Columbia Horse Blood Agar plates ( BioMérieux ) . The high fraction of sporulating cells under these growth conditions , facilitates the TEM analysis [89] . Samples were processed for TEM as described previously [90] .","Endospores , as those formed by the anaerobic Clostridial species , the aerobic Bacillus and related organisms , are highly resilient dormant cell types . Endospore development has been extensively studied in Bacillus subtilis . The process starts with an asymmetric division that forms a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore . Gene expression in these two cells is primarily governed by four cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors , two active sequentially in the mother cell and two active sequentially in the forespore . The precise timing of sigma factor activation is coordinated between the mother cell and forespore by several mechanisms . By combining studies of gene expression at the single cell level with the phenotypic characterization of mutants for the sigma genes , we describe the regulation of gene expression during endospore development by the intestinal pathogen C . difficile . In this organism , the endospore is the vehicle for transmission and persistence in the host and the environment . The overall picture that emerges is of a developmental program in which the coordination of gene expression between the forespore and mother cell is less tight than in B . subtilis , in what may be a general feature of endospore formation in the more ancient Clostridia group of bacteria .","['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Materials' 'and'

9,"We explore a framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable . This reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models . Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant . The reduction makes this framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications , where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously . As an application we analyze a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast , which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth . We show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch . In particular , this system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size , a mechanism to read the signal , and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred .
Protein phosphorylation is a common form of post-translational modification frequently used in nature to alter protein activity , for instance by changing the electrostatic properties of the protein or its spatial structure . The phosphorylation of the same protein at multiple different aminoacid residues is also very common , and it is found in proteins such as p53 [1] , Sic1 [2] , EGFR [3] , Wee1 [4] , Ste5 [5] and many others [6] . The differences in the function of single-site vs . multisite phosphorylation are not completely understood . Many multisite proteins are involved in regulatory processes that can benefit from the presence of bistability , hysteresis , or limit cycles , which require sufficiently nonlinear interactions in addition to the right type of feedback [7] , [8] . A reasonable hypothesis is that multisite phosphorylation can give rise to ultrasensitive dose responses , in a way that would not be possible in a comparable single-site system [9]–[13] . Many detailed mechanisms have also been proposed to explain the role of multisite systems in the emergence of bistability ( for examples , see [14] , [15] ) . On the other hand , such detailed multisite mechanisms are normally not used as part of actual mathematical models of biochemical interactions . This is because explicitly modeling multiple sites usually involves the introduction of numerous variables , one or more for each phosphorylation state , and realistic models are often too complex already to justify this additional effort . Systems that attempt to model biochemical reactions explicitly often use the assumption that the protein has two states , one active and one inactive , with a simple reaction to transform one into the other , effectively assuming that the protein only has one site . Other models are more phenomenological in nature and include , for example , Hill function terms in the equation that are less clearly tied to the actual biochemical reactions [16] , [17] . In this paper we describe a simple mechanistic approach for modeling multisite allosteric proteins . This approach , named modified fraction ( MF ) modeling , is capable of describing ultrasensitive dynamics without introducing a large number of additional variables . Under this framework one keeps track of the fraction of modified sites in the protein , and the concentration of active protein over time is estimated from this information . The protein is activated in a way that requires the phosphorylation of several but not all of the sites . The approximation becomes increasingly precise as the number of sites increases , with good estimates already for around four or more sites . In a sense , this mechanism can be considered a one-variable , quasi-steady state reduction of a model similar to the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric system [18] , although uses of MF modeling outside of MWC are also possible . The MF framework can also be extended to other types of multisite modification such as ligand binding , multisite transcription factor regulation , multisite methylation or acetylation , ubiquitination , etc [19] , [20] . Perhaps the best way to test the versatility of a modeling tool such as the one proposed is to implement it in an actual biochemical system . In the current work we describe a detailed mechanistic model of a cell size checkpoint . Cell size checkpoints halt the cell cycle at specific points until sufficient cell growth has occurred [21] , [22] . The mechanisms by which cell size checkpoints operate are poorly understood , and it is unclear whether they monitor actual cell size or parameters more closely related to the extent or rate of growth . In budding yeast , growth of a new cell is initiated when a daughter bud is formed on the surface of the cell [23] . The daughter bud initially grows in a polar manner , with all growth directed to the bud tip . Growth of the bud eventually switches to isotropic growth , in which the bud grows over its entire surface ( see Figure 1A ) [24] . The timing of the switch determines the duration of polar growth , which influences cell size and shape . It has been proposed in recent work by one of the authors that a cell size checkpoint controls the timing of this switch [25] . This checkpoint is the subject of our model . The variables are illustrated in Figure 1B and described in more detail below . See Tyson and Novak [26] for an accessible introduction to the systems-wide modeling of cell cycle checkpoints . The MF approximation equation was first developed in [27] , in the context of multisite systems with independent modification sites , with an emphasis on the estimation of the Hill exponents of sequential and nonsequential systems and on the comparison of their qualitative behavior . A major advance of the current paper , beyond the application to the cell cycle checkpoint , is to extend this work to cooperative and allosteric systems . Such systems are by definition non-independent , since the modification of one site accelerates the rate of modification of its neighbors . Cooperative systems are also more common and much better characterized than independent ones . The validation of the approximation in cooperative systems is ultimately based on a computational comparison of the MF reduction with detailed cooperative models having or variables . In the first two Results sections we carry out a description of the modified fraction method to model multisite systems , and we compare simulations of the reduced model with those of a detailed mechanistic model . In the remaining two Results sections we carry out a mathematical analysis of the proposed checkpoint signaling pathway . We hypothesize that this interaction pathway has the capacity to produce a bistable signal responsible for a sudden switch from polar to isotropic growth , once the bud has undergone sufficient polar growth . The model presents several desirable qualities for a checkpoint , in particular a clear downstream signal when a sufficient polar bud growth has occurred .
We start by describing the assumptions on our model in the context of multisite phosphorylation ( although it could also be applied to other irreversible covalent modifications as well as noncovalent ligand binding ) . Suppose that a protein substrate is phosphorylated by a kinase at possible sites and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase . The system is assumed to be nonsequential , so that there are different phosphoforms of , and the number of sites is thought to be relatively large e . g . . The system is cooperative in the sense that site phosphorylation accelerates the phosphorylation of neighboring sites . Since the number of sites is relatively large , the activation is thought to be cumulative and the effect of any individual site is assumed to be small . The sites are assumed to be equivalent to each other , in the sense that the rate of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is similar across all sites and that no site has a stronger effect on substrate activation than other sites . The activation of the substrate may be due to binding to another molecule or body , such as the cell membrane . It could also be due to an internal structural change that allows the substrate to interact differently with other proteins . Thus the active protein concentration can be defined as the concentration of the protein bound to a particular molecule or in a particular molecular state . Suppose that the phosphorylations lead to the concerted , redundant activation of the protein . That is , multiple phosphorylations are necessary for activation ( concerted ) , and not all sites need to be phosphorylated for full activation ( redundant ) . We define the activity function such that the fraction of active protein with phosphorylated sites is given by . There are many systems that likely fall within this general framework . For instance , Ste5 is a scaffold protein in budding yeast with phosphorylation sites , which relays a pheromone response only when it is bound to the membrane [28] , [29] . When phosphorylated by Cdk1 , it tends to unbind from the membrane , shutting down its activity . The sites are predicted to lie on an unstructured region of the protein and appear to act by changing the protein's bulk electrostatic properties . In the paper [29] , it was shown through site-directed mutagenesis that around five or more phosphorylations are necessary and sufficient for deactivation . Another recent example is the multisite phosphorylation of Cdc25 by Cdk1 in fission yeast , which was similarly studied in detail by mutating individual sites [30] . According to the modified fraction framework , we estimate the concentration of a particular protein state from the overall fraction of modified sites . For instance , if the protein has sites and the fraction of phosphorylated sites is , then the fraction of protein with only the first and last sites phosphorylated is roughlyHere is the total protein concentration . This is not an equality since cooperative effects introduce correlations among the sites , i . e . the sites are not independent of each other , but it is an approximation assuming cooperative effects are sufficiently weak . Multiplying on both sides by and adding over all possible phosphoforms with phosphorylations , the concentration of proteins with exactly phosphorylated sites out of a total of sites isOne can estimate the overall concentration of active protein asA key aspect of this formula is that if we denote the right hand side by , it can be shown that converges to as increases [31] . This gives the approximation ( 1 ) which becomes increasingly precise for large . Notice that the different quantities in this formula can potentially be measured in the lab - the active protein concentration via an activity assay , the total protein concentration via Western blot , and the activity function through site-directed mutagenesis . A timescale decomposition argument can be made to use this approximation away from steady state . If is the fraction of active sites over time , and the timescale of protein activation is much faster than the rate at which changes , then one can approximate at any given time using the same formula . This produces a convenient method for modeling multisite systems under the given assumptions by keeping track of the variable , without creating , let alone variables . On the other hand , if , or any other process affecting protein activation , is at least as fast as protein activation itself , then nontrivial dynamics might take place such as limit cycle oscillations , and the approximation can introduce errors . It is necessary to calculate the fraction of phosphorylation itself . Assuming linear rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation for , one obtains the system That is , , where is the fraction of inactive sites . This is the default for the model , although any other rate equation for can be used , including Michaelis-Menten complex formation at the level of the individual sites . As for the activity function , any sigmoidal function can be used , including functions measured directly by experiments . By default we assume the following form , which we will derive in the next section: See also [5] , [9] , [27] for other uses and derivations of this formula in the literature . The function can actually be highly switch-like for large , which illustrates how small increases in the kinase can result in large activity changes in the protein , unlike linear rate models with only one site . Other forms for the activity function have effectively been considered by by Kapuy et al [32] , and also by Wang et al [10] . In Figure 2A we show the relationship between the fraction of phosphorylated sites and the active protein concentration for a particular choice of the MF parameters using the approximation formula ( and chosen to fit the detailed model described in the next section for ) . Notice that the activation is concerted and redundant , in that a minimal threshold of phosphorylation is required for activation , and activation is reached for less than full phosphorylation . A validation of the performance of this model for is now shown in Figure 2 in the context of a system similar to the classical and widely used Monod-Wyman-Changeux model of an allosteric multisite protein [18] . The original MWC model describes the binding of oxygen to the different sites of hemoglobin and the allosteric transitions of this protein between two different states . Rather than modeling oxygen binding , a protein with phosphorylations is assumed to change between an active conformation and an inactive conformation . Each of these forms can also be phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at the rates given in the diagram in Figure 2B . Although the model is interpreted in a different way from MWC , from a mathematical point of view it is almost identical . The coefficient accounts for an assumption that the protein is phosphorylated at a faster rate when it is active than when it is inactive . The coefficients etc represent the fact that this is still a nonsequential model: for instance , can be phosphorylated at different sites , so the phosphorylation rate is multiplied by . See the derivation of this model from more basic principles in Text S1 , and a recent review on multisite systems by one of the authors [28] . Using this multisite model , we now derive parameters for a corresponding MF model . For instance , one can define the ‘average’ phosphorylation rate at a given phosphorylation site , regardless of whether the protein is active or inactive , , and the dephosphorylation rate . By way of derivation of the activity function , suppose that a protein with phosphorylations is switching between active and inactive form , At steady state , we assume that this exchange is balanced and calculate . Then the fraction of active sites with phosphorylations at steady state isIn other words , where and . See Text S1 . 3 for more details . In particular , the ultrasensitive behavior of the function generally increases with the number of sites . At any given time , the active protein concentration of the full model is defined as . In Figure 2C we compare the full 12-variable MWC model for with the corresponding MF approximation . For every value of the input kinase concentration , the resulting concentration of active protein is plotted at steady state . Notice the close similarity between the two graphs , which is even more surprising since MF is essentially a one-variable model . For comparison , we also plot the behavior of an overly simplified but all too commonly used model , in which the substrate is assumed to have a single phosphorylation site instead of sites , and it is modeled according to the reactionusing linear reaction rates . Notice that the behavior of this single-site model in Figure 2C is very different from that of the MWC model , and that any switch-like behavior in the response is lost . This can have important consequences regarding the existence of multiple steady states , hysteresis , oscillations etc in the context of larger systems , which will be illustrated below . It is easy to show that , i . e . it corresponds to when . It should be noted that if the single site system is modeled using Michaelis-Menten reactions rather than linear rates , it could have strongly ultrasensitive behavior in the saturation regime via zero-order ultrasensitivity [33]; see the Discussion section for more details . We carried out a calculation of the distance between and for many different combinations of the number of sites and the allosteric parameter . For every such set of parameters , the two graphs were plotted at steady state as a function of , and the error was calculated in Figure 2D . Notice that the approximation is within 1% precision for arbitrary and . On the other hand , in order to obtain high ultrasensitivity it is required that be relatively large and/or be small ( Figure 2E ) . See also Figure S2 , where additional parameter variations are explored over four orders of magnitude using the same type of graphs , with similar results . It is worth comparing this methodology with the approach known in the literature as rule-based modeling , where a series of chemical reactions is defined using a streamlined algorithm , and high-powered computing is used to handle the resulting large number of variables; see e . g . BioNetGen [34] . The advantage of this method is that a large number of reactions can be defined and handled this way , including complex parameter optimizations . One disadvantage is that the combinatorial explosion resulting from combining reactions can sometimes exceed the computational power . Another is that the large number of equations makes any mathematical analysis difficult , if at all possible . It is interesting that the MWC model can actually be described in terms of rule-based modeling . In Figure S1A we describe a series of chemical reactions , over all possible phosphoform states , and we show in Text S1 that this system is in fact equivalent to the MWC model . Thus MF can also be seen as the 1-variable reduction of a system with variables and a much larger number of reactions . In this section , we will embed the MF system within increasingly complex systems of equations . We consistently use upper case for proteins and lower case for modified fractions of sites . However , we will first provide some technical experimental background regarding this specific pathway . In order to find the steady states of both subsystems together , recall that each one can be reduced to a single equation , so that the steady states correspond to the joint solution of the two equations . For fixed , the solutions of the full model form the intersection of the graphs for the equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) . This is illustrated in Figure 3F , where the graphs in Figure 3C and Figure 3E are superimposed on the same plane . From a control perspective , the upstream and downstream systems have each an input and an ouptut , and they feed back into each other ( see the two dotted boxes in Figure 1B ) . The active Zds1/PP2A dimer also acts as the overall output of the system , since it triggers the downstream response to cell cycle regulatory proteins . Although it is natural that an increase in the Rho1 flow can eventually trigger the activation of the pathway , the main focus here is not in the flow but in the overall Rho1 concentration at the bud tip . Given that Rho1 has a rate of growth proportional to and a linear rate of degradation , at steady state one can show that and are proportional , . This follows from adding the ODE rate equations at steady state , . In this way one can use the total Rho1 concentration as a bifurcation parameter at steady state even though it is simultaneously a variable in the system . Alternatively , since enzymatic reactions and dimer formation are fast processes compared with Rho1 flux and Rho1 degradation , one can let be the slow variable in the system and carry out a timescale decomposition analysis using as a constant [39] . Let's look at how the system has a hysteretic response for increasing values of the flow signal and the corresponding total Rho1 concentration at steady state . An increase in these values has the effect of raising the graph associated with the upstream system , as shown in Figure 4A . For smaller values of , the intersection of both graphs includes three positive steady states ( notice the two graphs don't quite intersect at the origin ) . But when increases over a certain threshold , the intersection of the two graphs contains a single positive steady state , with a large value of . This can cause an abrupt change in the qualitative behavior of the system , triggering a sudden increase in the Zds1/PP2A output . Once this change has taken place , the concentration of the output stays high even if the input decreases . Figure 4B shows a sample timecourse of the system for a time-variable vesicle flow ( dotted line ) . The total Rho1 concentration increases over time with the inflow of vesicles . At a certain timepoint the active Rho1 concentration abruptly increases , due to the switch at the Pkc1/Rho1 upstream level . An increase in Rho1/Pkc1 concentration some time before this can be seen in Figure 4C . At a later time the switch between Zds1 and PP2A is also triggered , leading to a sudden increase in PP2A/Zds1 concentration . Even under variable flow , the total Rho1 concentration roughly corresponds to the membrane accumulated at the bud , except for a certain amount of variability due to Rho1 degradation . Lowering the Rho1 degradation rate can decrease this difference . Notice that the vesicle flow oscillations do not correspond to cell division , but to oscillations in the rate of growth , for instance due to varying food availability . In Figure 4D we plot the output signal PP2A/Zds1 as a function of total Rho1 at steady state and overlay the solution of the timecourse simulation ( red stars ) . This graph also illustrates the hysteretic behavior of the system , in that once a critical threshold of Rho1 concentration is reached , the output signal is dramatically increased . This change would constitute a clear signal that the bud has reached a large enough size for crossing the polar/isotropic growth checkpoint . Since both the downstream ( PP2A , Zds1 ) switch and the upstream ( Rho1 , Pkc1 ) switch are driven by positive feedback loops , it is valid to ask which of the two loops is more relevant for the overall system behavior . We argue that it is the downstream loop that is more essential , using the bifurcation analysis in Figure 3 and Figure 4A . If the upstream system is not bistable but has a single steady state for every input , then the graph in Figure 3E is replaced by a single-valued decreasing function . Nevertheless this ( green ) line can still have one or three intersections with the ( blue ) downstream dose response in Figure 4A , indicating hysteresis for the overall system . On the other hand if the downstream system is not bistable , then the blue curve in Figure 4A is replaced by a single-valued , increasing function , which would be unlikely to have three intersection points with the ( green ) upstream dose response . Thus the downstream switch is essential , while the upstream switch is not . Notice that this system contains the standard elements of a signal transduction pathway , including an initiating signal ( vesicles ) , a sensor ( Rho1 ) , a series of transducers ( Pkc1 , PP2A , etc ) , and an effector ( active Zds1/PP2A ) . Total Rho1 is a proxy for the membrane concentration , even if bud growth slows for a period of time , and the cascade of reactions allows the signal to be transduced from the membrane to Zds1/PP2A and ultimately the cyclin dependent kinase . To ensure the high fidelity of the signal transmission [40] , the downstream signal is sent abruptly after total Rho1 concentration reaches a particular size . Notice that longer periods of inactivity can potentially reduce the Rho1 concentration significantly – one possible prediction is that after such a period the bud grows longer than expected .
In this paper we have introduced a simple and compact framework to describe the dynamics of allosteric multisite phosphorylation systems , and we have applied this tool to a new molecular model of a size checkpoint in budding yeast . Multisite phosphorylation modeling can be problematic because ignoring the multiple sites can have significant effects in the dynamics , while introducing many auxiliary phosphoform variables can be cumbersome in more realistic models . The modified fraction approach is intuitive and flexible ( model the sites instead of the protein ) , and it only introduces one additional variable per protein . The components of the MF model , namely the function and the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of individual sites , can potentially be subject to direct experimental measurement , unlike the use of more abstract Hill function terms . This can allow to carry out ‘raw-data modeling’ e . g . to use an experimentally measured activity function directly in the model rather than using it to derive parameters . This methodology is also useful out of equilibrium when the timescale of phosphorylation is sufficiently fast compared with other timescales in the system . There are several reasons why the MF method might be particularly suitable for modeling many multisite phosphorylation systems . Nonsequential phosphorylation is likely more common in nature than the more often modeled sequential systems , since enforcing sequential phosphorylations would require an additional mechanistic effort . Bioinformatic data suggests that most phosphorylation sites in multisite proteins are located in unstructured and unconserved protein regions [6] , suggesting that often it is the collective effect that matters rather than the individual sites . There is also experimental evidence in yeast signal transduction that certain proteins , such as Ste5 , are activated in a concerted and redundant manner , although this type of information is still unknown for most proteins . Notice that the approximation formula would still hold if the protein activation is not concerted or redundant . In that case the formula will just approximate a dose response that may not be ultrasensitive . One of the best known mechanisms for ultrasensitive dose responses is zero-order ultrasensitivity , as suggested by Goldbeter and Koshland [33] , [41] . Its main assumption is that substrate concentration needs to be in the saturation regime i . e . large compared to the value of the enzymes . The MF method does not pose any constraint on , in fact the linear regime we used can be found when substrate concentrations are small compared to values . Moreover , MF also applies when the enzymatic reactions involve complex formation , by writing a Michaelis-Menten equation for . Therefore zero-order ultrasensitivity can be used in synergy with MF in the saturation regime , and MF can be used regardless of value . A zero-order dose response could likely replicate the behavior of the MWC model as shown in Figure 2C , however it could not be considered a short hand notation for MWC since the two mechanisms are fundamentally different . In the case of the checkpoint pathway , the active proteins Pkc1 and PP2A have been found to have an approximate of 0 . 5 [42] and 1 . 2 [43] , respectively , for specific targets . The overall concentrations of their substrates in the cell are much lower - however these proteins tend to localize at the bud , so that the resulting local concentrations are unknown and it is unclear whether a zero-order approach would apply . A recent paper by Martins and Swain [44] points out that zero-order ultrasensitivity often results from low enzyme to substrate ratios , and localized proteins that act as enzymes and substrates for each other would likely not satisfy such ratios . That paper proposes instead a mechanism involving an allosteric model analogous to MWC , using enzyme sequestration to obtain ultrasensitivity . The paper by Kapuy et al [32] also proposes a mechanism for bistability through ultrasensitive effects , and this mechanism is applied to a detailed model of the budding yeast G1-S transition in Barik et al [45] . Other mechanisms for ultrasensitivity involve competition among substrates for the same enzyme [46] and protein localization [12] , among others [28] , [47] . More generally , in cell regulatory networks there is a need to implement nontrivial dynamics such as bistable switches and hysteresis , which requires some form of nonlinear response in addition to the right feedback interconnections . It has been observed that several regulatory proteins have multiple phosphorylation sites , and there are many open questions regarding their intended function . Together with the onerous nature of modeling several multisite proteins using sequential networks and multiple variables each , it can be seen why a one-variable reduction such as MF can allow for much-needed simplicity . The actual mechanisms regulating the interactions between cell size and cell division remain largely unanswered in many cases . This has left few alternative options apart from somewhat heuristic approaches in otherwise very detailed models , see e . g . [48] . The present model is an attempt , based on recent experiments , to construct a detailed mechanistic model in the context of the polar to isotropic bud transition in yeast . Notice that if the proteins PP2A , Pkc1 , Zds1 had only one site each , then according to the argument in the first Results section , and the downstream and upstream models could never be bistable ( see equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ) . The multiple sites are providing the underlying nonlinearity so that the models can have interesting dynamical behaviors . This is consistent with the work by Yang et al [49] , which reached the same conclusion through randomized parameter searches in multisite cell cycle models . Also , the equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , which represent the steady states of the downstream and upstream systems , have the same qualitative behavior for a wide range of parameters . In this sense one can say that the switch-like nature of the checkpoint is robust to many parameter changes , provided that a few key qualities are satisfied . The bistability in each subsystem is due in part to positive feedback loops in each subsystem , one between Pkc1 and the Rho1/Pkc1 dimer , and another between Zds1 and the PP2A/Zds1 dimer . Notice that while Rho1/Pkc1 activates PP2A , the downstream PP2A/Zds1 inactivates Pkc1 , forming a negative feedback loop . This feedback could serve to reduce the activity of the pathway before a sufficient Rho1 signal has accumulated . Notice that the switch-like activation of Cdk1 is a complex process that may well be regulated by other mechanisms in conjunction with the switch discussed , and that this overall regulation also depends on the organism studied . The MF framework eliminates several parameters such as the number of phosphorylation sites ( as long as it is sufficiently large ) , the transition rates and the cooperativity coefficient . The remaining parameters , such as the shape of the activity function , can potentially be measured in the lab using site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays . However this is still a formidable task and one that is yet to be done for most proteins involved in cell cycle regulation . Since it is assumed in the derivation of the formula ( 1 ) that the sites are roughly independent from each other , one might think that the MF framework doesn't work for allosteric or cooperative systems . However the detailed model in Figure 2 is allosteric , and yet the model closely describes its dynamics . In simulations we find that the accuracy of the representation is increased when is large ( e . g . ) and/or the cooperativity is weak . The use of a MWC-type model for multisite phosphorylation has been pointed out in the past , see for instance [5] and the more recent [44] . Questions for future work include the following: if phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the multisite protein is not faster than other processes in the system , can one still approximate away from equilibrium ? This might be possible by defining a simple differential equation for instead of the algebraic equation ( 1 ) . Also , the linear dynamics used to calculate the fraction can be replaced by more complex models such as a Michaelis-Menten reaction , which may be explored in detail , including the interaction with zero-order mechanisms . This might lead to bistable behavior in the full multisite model , which raises the question of how the corresponding model reduction might be , possibly involving multivalued functions .
Since most quantitative information about the pathway is unknown , we make educated estimates on the order of magnitude of the parameters . Since parameters are clustered in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , dependence on the parameters is more limited . Protein concentrations usually range from 0 . 001 to 10 in the cell . The concentrations of total PP2A ( ) , Zds1 ( ) and Pkc1 ( ) are set between 0 . 01 and 0 . 1 as indicated in Table 1 . Define for all . The dissociation rate has been observed to be quite low in experiments since most Zds1 has been found bound to PP2A . We set it as 0 . 001 , which is in the range of drugs binding to their target proteins . is set higher at 0 . 1 . The unit-less parameters are set to 0 . 1 and 1 respectively , indicating the steady state ratio of inactive to active substrate when the two antagonistic enzymes are in similar concentration . The rates are set to 0 . 01 , indicating that when e . g . there are equal amounts of active and inactive substrate at steady state . is set at 0 . 0002 . Very little is known about the values of the individual rates . Fortunately as it is shown in the analysis in Text S1 , most of the dynamic rate constants appear only in the form , instead of individually . These steady state ratios are generally easier to estimate experimentally than the individual parameters [50] . However the actual rates determine the transient behavior of the system and to some extent determine also its steady state values . Since a majority of the reverse rates share the same units of , we set the values of these parameters and then find the corresponding to fit the given ratio . For simplicity we set [14] , [51] . We set for maximal protein concentration , that is , . The Rho1 degradation rate is set to 0 . 0001 ; it can be further decreased in order to stabilize the Rho1 protein . Regarding the activity functions , we assume that the ultrasensitive behavior of these graphs increases with the number of phosphorylation sites; see the derivation of in the Results and also [5] . Since PP2A , Zds1 , and Pkc1 have been found to have around 3 , 5 , and 8 sites respectively , we implement this with parameters that produce the graph observed in Figure 3A . See Table 1 for a list of parameter values . The initial conditions used in the model correspond to the system in the off state . They are equal to zero for all variables , except and .","A large number of proteins in the cell are modified post-translationally by phosphorylation at multiple specific locations . This can help bring about interesting dynamical behaviors such as bistability or all-or-none responses to stimuli . Such behaviors are in turn important for cellular decision-making , differentiation , or the regulation of cellular processes . In this paper we propose the use of a specific technique for modeling allosteric multisite proteins , which can be thought of as the reduced version of a more detailed set of reactions . After validating this technique computationally by comparison to more detailed systems , we apply it to a new model of a signal transduction pathway with several multisite proteins . The model is concerned with a mechanism in budding yeast that is thought to measure the extent of daughter bud growth and send a signal to initiate mitosis when sufficient growth has occurred . Using the given framework we derive an analytically tractable model that creates the desired all-or-none signal . Overall , we give quantitative support to a newly discovered biochemical pathway , and we show the utility of the new modeling framework in the context of a realistic biological problem .",['Abstract' 'Introduction' 'Results' 'Discussion' 'Methods'],"['nonlinear' 'dynamics' 'systems' 'biology' 'biochemical' 'simulations'
