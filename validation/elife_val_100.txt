The DNA in genes encodes the basic information needed to build an organism or control its day-to-day operations . Most cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , but different types of cell use the information differently . For example , many of the genes that are active in a muscle cell are different from those that are active in a skin cell . These different patterns of gene activation largely determine a cell’s identity and are brought about by DNA-binding proteins or chemical modifications to the DNA ( which are both forms of so-called epigenetic regulation ) . Nevertheless , cells occasionally change their identities – a phenomenon that is referred to as reprograming . This process allows tissues to be regenerated after wounding , but , due to technical difficulties , reprograming has been often studied in isolated cells grown in a dish . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . set out to understand how being surrounded by intact tissue influences reprograming . The experiments made use of C . elegans worms , because disturbing how this worm’s DNA is packaged can trigger its cells to undergo reprograming . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . show that a signaling pathway that is found in many different animals enhances this kind of reprograming in C . elegans . On the one hand , these findings help in understanding how epigenetic regulation can be altered by a specific tissue environment . On the other hand , the findings also suggest that abnormal signaling can result in altered epigenetic control of gene expression and lead to cells changing their identity . Indeed , increased signaling is linked to a major epigenetic mechanism seen in specific blood tumors , suggesting that the regulatory principles uncovered using this simple worm model could eventually provide insights into a human disease . A future challenge will be to determine precisely how the studied signaling pathway interacts with the epigenetic regulator that controls reprograming . Understanding this interaction in molecular detail could help to devise strategies for controlling reprograming . These strategies could in turn lead to treatments for people with conditions that cause specific cells types to be lost , such as Alzheimer’s disease or injuries .
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections – including pneumonia , blood stream infections , and urinary tract infections – in hospitalized patients . These infections can be difficult to treat because some K . pneumoniae are resistant to antibiotics . The bacteria are normally found in the human intestine , and they do not usually cause infections in healthy people . This implies that healthy people’s immune systems are better able to fend off K . pneumoniae infections; learning how could help scientists develop new ways to treat or prevent infections in hospitalized patients . In healthy people , a type of immune cell called neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacterial infections . Several different proteins are needed to activate neutrophils , including a protein called SKAP2 . But the role of this protein in fighting K . pneumoniae infections is not clear . To find out what role SKAP2 plays in the defense against pneumonia caused by K . pneumoniae , Nguyen et al . compared infections in mice with and without the protein . Mice lacking SKAP2 in their white blood cells had more bacteria in their lungs than normal mice . The experiments showed that neutrophils from mice with SKAP2 produce a burst of chemicals called “reactive oxygen species” , which can kill bacteria . But neutrophils without the protein do not . Without SKAP2 , several proteins that help produce reactive oxygen species do not work . Understanding the role of SKAP2 in fighting infections may help scientists better understand the immune system . This could help clinicians to treat conditions that cause it to be hyperactive or ineffective . More studies are needed to determine if SKAP2 works the same way in human neutrophils and if it works against all types of K . pneumoniae . If it does , then scientists might be able use this information to develop therapies that help the immune system fight infections .
Malaria is one of the world's most deadly infections , causing 100s of 1000s of deaths each year despite being both preventable and curable . Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes . When a mosquito bites a human , Plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva . The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver , infects liver cells and multiplies within those cells without causing any noticeable symptoms . After remaining silent in the liver for weeks or months , the now abundant parasite ruptures the host liver cell , re-enters the bloodstream , and begins infecting red blood cells . If another mosquito bites the infected individual and takes a blood meal , the parasite moves into the mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues . There are several species of Plasmodium that are known to cause malaria . The most widely studied species is P . falciparum , which also causes one of the deadliest types of malaria . However , another Plasmodium species called P . vivax is the most widely distributed species and , despite being less virulent than P . falciparum , is particularly dangerous because it causes recurring malaria . In contrast to P . falciparum , P . vivax has the ability to form hypnozoites: a dormant form of the parasite that can remain inside liver cells for long periods of time , sometimes for years . The reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites can regularly populate the bloodstream with the infectious form of the parasite , triggering relapses of malaria . Even if an individual suffering a relapse receives prompt treatment to clear parasites in the blood , more parasites may emerge from the liver and cause new blood-stage infections . White et al . developed a mathematical model to help understand how P . vivax is transmitted . Unlike many of the established models of malaria transmission , the new model accounts for the reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites in the liver , and assumes that hypnozoites in the reservoir either die , or are activated and enter the bloodstream , at a constant rate . This produces patterns that closely match how often relapses occur in patients . White et al . go on to predict that although many infected people have few or no hypnozoites in their liver , some have many hypnozoites , and these people are more likely to suffer from malaria relapses . This suggests that if the initial treatments given to malaria sufferers incorporate additional drugs that kill the hypnozoites in the liver , then it may be possible to substantially reduce the extent of P . vivax transmission .
The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest tropical forest in the world . Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife , rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon , which is a core component of all life on Earth . Certain forms of carbon , such as the gas carbon dioxide , contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests . Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules . The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems . Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest . This “selective logging” results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest , but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow . New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees . However , it is not clear how differences in the forest ( for example , forest maturity ) , environmental factors ( such as climate or soil ) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon . Piponiot et al . used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest . The models show that the forest’s ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions . For example , the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable . The findings of Piponiot et al . highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery . The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest .
Neurons that arise in the adult nervous system originate from neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells . Neural stem cells have long lives , much of which they spend in a quiescent state . Neural stem cells can also give rise to neural progenitor cells , which proliferate rapidly during their short lives and then ‘differentiate’ into neurons or glia . Unlike some other tissues , it has not been possible to identify or purify neural stem cells directly from the tissue . Consequently , neural stem and progenitor cells have usually been studied retrospectively , based on their ability to form colonies in laboratory cell cultures . A region of the brain called the subventricular zone contains both neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells , and is one of only two regions of the brain where neural stem cells are found in adult mammals . When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around ( rather than growing on a surface ) , a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres . Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia , the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells . However , the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain . Now , Mich , Signer et al . have used a technique called flow cytometry to identify and isolate neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells directly from the subventricular zone . The neural stem cells , which Mich , Signer et al . term pre-GEPCOT cells ( based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells ) , were long-lived and quiescent , but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture . The neurosphere-forming cells , named GEPCOT cells , were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain . These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all , and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions . The identification of undifferentiated pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells will make it possible to directly study the properties of these cells inside the mouse brain , and to isolate live cells to test how they function . The results also highlight the need for new tests to study neural stem cell function , given that current tests using neurospheres do not detect stem cells as commonly assumed .
Cells can sense a range of mechanical forces both inside and outside the body , such as the stroke of a fingertip or the filling of a lung . Pores on the surface of the cell called Piezo channels open up in response to this pressure . This allows ions to flood in to the cell and trigger a series of biochemical reactions that alter the cell’s behavior . Piezo channels have a unique bowl-like structure that transforms the shape of the cell surface around them , potentially affecting how nearby proteins behave . Previous research had suggested that these channels might be unevenly distributed across the cell surface , and were predicted to modify each other’s behaviors when tightly packed together . This cooperative response would have a significant impact on how cells sense mechanical force . To investigate if this was the case , Lewis and Grandl studied a mouse cell called Neuro2A which naturally produces Piezo ion channels . In the experiment , pressure was applied to different parts of the cell and the electric current generated by ions moving across the surface was recorded: the higher the electrical activity , the more ion channels present . This showed that Piezo channels are randomly distributed across the cell surface and do not tend to cluster together . The same Neuro2A cells were then engineered to produce up to one hundred times more Piezo proteins . Despite the channels being more densely packed together , how they responded to mechanical force remained the same . These results suggest that Piezo channels act independently and are not influenced by close proximity to one another . Lewis and Grandl propose that this property may ensure that all parts of the cell surface react to mechanical force in the same way . Further work is needed to see if this finding applies to other cell types that produce Piezo proteins .
Many of our decisions are made on the basis of imperfect or ‘noisy’ information . A longstanding goal in neuroscience is to work out how such noise affects three aspects of decision-making: the accuracy ( or appropriateness ) of a choice , the speed at which the choice is made , and the decision-maker’s confidence that they have chosen correctly . One theory of decision-making is that the brain simultaneously accumulates evidence for each of the options it is considering , until one option exceeds a threshold and is declared the ‘winner’ . This theory is known as bounded evidence accumulation . It predicts that increasing the noisiness of the available information decreases the accuracy of decisions made in response . Counterintuitively , it also predicts that such an increase in noise speeds up decision-making and increases confidence levels . Zylberberg et al . have now tested these predictions experimentally by getting human volunteers and monkeys to perform a series of trials where they had to decide whether a set of randomly moving dots moved to the left or to the right overall . Using a newly developed method , the noisiness of the dot motion could be changed between trials . The effectiveness of this technique was confirmed by recording the activity of neurons in the region of the monkey brain that processes visual motion information . After each trial , the humans rated their confidence in their decision . By comparison , the monkeys could indicate that they were not confident in a decision by opting for a guaranteed small reward on certain trials ( instead of the larger reward they received when they correctly indicated the direction of motion of the dots ) . In both humans and monkeys , increasing the noisiness associated with the movement of the dots led to faster and more confident decision-making , just as the bounded evidence accumulation framework predicts . Furthermore , the results presented by Zylberberg et al . suggest that the brain does not always gauge how reliable evidence is in order to fine-tune decisions . Now that the role of noise in decision-making is better understood , future experiments could attempt to reveal how artificial manipulations of the brain contribute both information and noise to a decision . Other experiments might ascertain when the brain can learn that noisy information should invite slower , more cautious decisions .
Although aging might seem to be a passive process—resulting simply from wear and tear over a lifetime—it can actually be accelerated or slowed down by genetic mutations . This phenomenon has been most thoroughly studied in the nematode worm , Caenorhabditis elegans . Normally , this worm lives for just two or three weeks , but genetic mutations that reduce the activity of certain enzymes in a series of biochemical reactions known as the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway can extend its lifespan by up to a factor of ten , and similar effects have been seen in flies and mice . Lifespans can also be increased by blocking other signalling pathways or restricting the intake of calories . This increase in lifespan associated with the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway is known to involve a protein called DAF-16 and two kinases called AKT-1 and AKT-2 . Under normal conditions the AKT kinases add several phosphate groups to the DAF-16 , which prevents it from travelling to the nucleus of the cell . However , when genetic techniques are used to block the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway , the AKT kinases are unable to add the phosphate groups; this leaves the DAF-16 free to enter the nucleus , where it activates a network of genes that promotes longevity . In addition to kinases , the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway also involves enzymes called phosphatases that remove the phosphate groups from other proteins . In particular , a phosphatase called calcineurin is known to be involved in the regulation of lifespan , but the details of this process are not fully understood . Now , Tao et al . have carried out a series of genetic and biochemical experiments to determine how phosphatases exert their influence on aging . The results show that calcineurin targets DAF-16 , the same protein that is targeted by the AKT kinases . Moreover , another kinase also targets DAF-16 when the worm is exposed to heat , starvation or some other form of stress: this kinase , which is not involved in the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway , is called CAMKII . Tao et al . show that these kinases act on DAF-16 in different ways: CAMKII activates it by adding the phosphate group at a specific site known as S286 , whereas the AKT kinases deactivate DAF-16 because they add phosphate groups at different sites , thereby preventing it from entering the nucleus . Calcineurin neutralizes the effect of CAMKII by removing the phosphate group at S286 to deactivate the DAF-16 . In addition to shedding new light on the regulation of lifespan in C . elegans , the new results could improve our understanding of aging in humans , and also the development of diabetes and other age-related diseases , because the equivalent molecules in mammalian cells are regulated in similar ways .
Anyone who has ever lived with a cat is familiar with its grooming behavior . This innate behavior follows a particular sequence as the cat methodically cleans its body parts one-by-one . Many animals also have grooming habits , even insects such as fruit flies . The fact that grooming sequences are seen across such different species suggests that this behavior is important for survival . Nevertheless , how the brain organizes grooming sequences , or other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks , is not well understood . Fruit flies make a good model for studying grooming behavior for a couple of reasons . First , they are fastidious cleaners . When coated with dust they will faithfully carry out a series of cleaning tasks to clean each body part . Second , there are many genetic tools and techniques that researchers can use to manipulate the fruit flies' behaviors . One technique allows specific brain cells to be targeted and activated to trigger particular behaviors . Seeds et al . used these sophisticated techniques , computer modeling , and behavioral observations to uncover how the brains of fruit flies orchestrate a grooming sequence . Dust-covered flies follow a predictable sequence of cleaning tasks: beginning by using their front legs to clean their eyes , they then clean their antennae and head . This likely helps to protect their sensory organs . Next , they move on to the abdomen , possibly to ensure that dust doesn't interfere with their ability to breathe . Wings and thorax follow last . Periodically , the flies stop to rub their legs together to remove any accumulated dust before resuming the cleaning sequence . Seeds et al . activated different sets of brain cells one-by-one to see if they could trigger a particular grooming task and found that individual cleaning tasks could be triggered , in the absence of dust , by stimulating a specific group of brain cells . This suggests each cleaning task is a discrete behavior controlled by a subset of cells . Then Seeds et al . tried to stimulate more than one cleaning behavior at a time; they discovered that wing-cleaning suppressed thorax-cleaning , abdomen-cleaning suppressed both of these , and head-cleaning suppressed all the others . This suggests that a ‘hierarchy’ exists in the brain that exactly matches the sequence that flies normally follow as they clean their body parts . By learning more about how the brain coordinates grooming sequences , the findings of Seeds et al . may also provide insights into other behaviors that involve a sequence of tasks , such as nest building in animals or typing in humans . Following on from this work , one of the next challenges will be to see if such behaviors also use a ‘suppression hierarchy’ to ensure that individual tasks are carried out in the right order .
Human reproductive cells—eggs and sperm—are produced through a process called meiosis . This means a ‘parent’ cell in the ovaries or testes undergoes two stages of cell division: it first divides into two cells , which then divide again to produce four ‘daughter’ cells . A crucial part of meiosis is ensuring that each daughter cell has half the number of chromosomes that the parent cell did . Before the first round of meiosis , the chromosomes in the parent cell are copied to produce enough chromosomes for the four daughter cells . The distribution of these chromosomes between the daughter cells is determined by the opposing forces acting on them . The pairs of identical chromosomes produced during the copying process are held together by a proteinaceous glue , while microtubules attached to a structure called the spindle—which has poles at opposite ends of the cell—try to pull these pairs of chromosomes apart . Rattani et al . now show that a protein called shugoshin-like 2 ( Sgol2 ) , which is involved in holding pairs of identical chromosomes together after the first round of division , has a bigger role than was previously realised . Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by , it is thought , facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process . The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified . Thus , Rattani et al . show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis , Sgol2 appears to have a key , if not unique , role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide .
The nervous system contains billions of cells called neurons that connect to each other to form complex networks via junctions known as synapses . Synapses form between the end of an elongated section ( called the axon ) of one neuron and the tiny projections ( or dendrites ) from the cell body of the next neuron . Throughout the lifespan of an animal , the nervous system responds to experiences and stimuli from the environment by changing the strength of the connections at synapses; this is known as ‘synaptic plasticity’ . In this way , long-term information about learning and memory can be stored and used to direct future responses to similar situations . Many proteins are involved in forming and altering synapses . The genes that code for these proteins are found in the nucleus of the neuron within the cell body . To make new proteins , copies of genes are made using molecules called mRNAs , which then leave the nucleus and are used as templates by the machinery that assemble proteins . Previous studies have shown that mRNA molecules are transported from the cell body to the axon and dendrites , but it is not clear exactly where the proteins are produced . Kim et al . have now studied the movement of mRNAs in neurons from the sea slug Aplysia during synapse formation and synapse plasticity . This showed that mRNAs are delivered equally throughout the neuron , and so it appears that mRNAs are not targeted to a particular synapse . However , the level of protein production using these mRNA molecules is much higher in places where synapses are being formed or altered . A protein called netrin-1 promotes protein production in the dendrites of neurons at these synapses . Kim et al . demonstrate that although mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuron , they are only used to make proteins at specific synapses . This allows the entire neuron to be in a state of readiness to make new synapses or alter existing ones in response to stimuli from the environment . Understanding more about how this local control of protein production works within neurons may provide new insights into diseases that affect synaptic plasticity .
Embryos begin as a collection of similar cells , which progress in stages to form a huge variety of cell types in particular arrangements . These patterns of cells give rise to the different tissues and organs that make up the body . Although we often use ‘model’ organisms such as mice and frogs to study how embryos develop , our species has evolved unique ways to control organ development . Investigating these processes is difficult: we cannot experiment on human embryos , and our development is hard to recreate in test tubes . As a result , we do not fully understand how developing human cells specialize and organize . Libby et al . have now created a new system to study how different genes control cell organization . The system uses human pluripotent stem cells – cells that have the ability to specialize into any type of cell . Some of the stem cells are modified using a technique called inducible CRISPR interference , which makes it possible to reduce the activity of certain genes in these cells . Libby et al . used this technique to investigate how changes to the activity of two genes – called ROCK1 and CDH1 – affect how a mixed group of stem cells organized themselves . Cells that lacked ROCK1 formed bands near the edges of the group . Cells that lacked CDH1 segregated themselves from other cells , forming ‘islands’ inside the main group . The cells retained their ability to specialize into any type of cell after forming these patterns . However , specific groups of cells were more likely to become certain cell types . The method developed by Libby et al . can be used to study a range of complex tissue development and cell organization processes . Future work could create human tissue model systems for research into human disease or drug development .
You can read this sentence from beginning to end without losing track of its meaning thanks to your working memory . This system temporarily stores information relevant to whatever task you are currently performing . However , the more items you try to hold in working memory at once , the poorer the quality of each of the resulting memories . It has long been argued that this phenomenon – known as the set size effect – occurs because the brain devotes a fixed amount of neural resources to working memory . But this theory struggles to account for certain experimental results . It also fails to explain why the brain would not simply recruit more resources whenever it has more items to remember . After all , your heart does something similar by beating faster whenever you increase your physical activity . Van den Berg and Ma break with the idea that working memory resources are fixed . They propose that resource allocation is flexible and driven by two conflicting goals: maximize memory performance , but use as few neural resources as necessary . Indeed , a computer simulation that follows this strategy mimics the set size effects seen in healthy volunteers . In the model , the items most relevant for a task are stored more accurately than less important ones , a phenomenon also observed in participants . Lastly , the simulation predicts that the total amount of resources devoted to working memory will vary with the number of items to be remembered . This too is consistent with the results of previous experiments . Working memory thus appears to be more flexible than previously thought . The amount of resources that the brain allocates to working memory is not fixed but could be the result of balancing resource cost against cognitive performance . If this is confirmed , it may be possible to improve working memory by offering rewards , or by increasing the perceived importance of a task .
Plants and other living organisms can survive stress and starvation by digesting and recycling parts of their own cells . This process is known as autophagy and it involves engulfing cellular material inside spherical structures called autophagosomes , before delivering it to sites in the cell where digestive enzymes can break the material down . A form of autophagy , known as selective autophagy , can specifically degrade toxic substances such as disease-causing microbes . Selective autophagy works through proteins called autophagy cargo receptors that define which molecules are targeted for degradation . However , it was not clear whether autophagy protects plants from infections , or how much disease-causing microbes interfere with this process for their own benefit . The microbe that causes late blight of potatoes ( called Phytophthora infestans ) is infamous for triggering widespread famines in Ireland in the 19th century . This disease-causing microbe continues to pose a serious threat to food security today , and parasitizes plant tissues by releasing proteins called effectors that enter the plant’s cells to subvert the plant’s physiology and counteract its defenses . Dagdas , Belhaj et al . now report that an effector from P . infestans , called PexRD54 , can bind to autophagy-related protein from potato , called ATG8CL , and stimulate the formation of autophagosomes . Further experiments revealed that the PexRD54 effector could outcompete a plant autophagy cargo receptor that would otherwise bind to ATG8CL . This plant cargo receptor contributes to the plant’s defences , and by preventing it from interacting with ATG8CL , PexRD54 makes the plant more susceptible to infection by P . infestans . These findings show that the PexRD54 effector has evolved to interact with an autophagy-related protein to counteract the plant’s defences . Dagdas , Belhaj et al . suggest that PexRD54 might do this by activating autophagy to selectively eliminate some of the molecules that the plant use to defend itself . Furthermore , P . infestans might also benefit from the nutrients that are released when cellular material is broken down via autophagy . Future work could test these two hypotheses and explore whether other effectors from disease-causing microbes work in a similar way .
When the supply of oxygen to the heart is reduced , its cells start to die within hours , the heart muscle becomes less able to contract , and the area becomes inflamed . This inflammation is accompanied by an influx of immune cells . It also activates other cells known as cardiac fibroblasts that help to break down the framework of molecules that supported the damaged heart tissue and replace it with a scar . This response is part of the normal repair process , but it can lead to the formation of scar tissue in non-damaged areas of the heart . Excess scar tissue makes the heart muscle less able to contract and increases the affected individual’s chance of dying . Understanding how this repair process works is an important step in developing strategies to minimise the damage caused by coronary artery disease or heart attacks . However , existing laboratory models are only partly able to recreate the conditions seen in real heart tissue . To properly understand the response at the level of living cells , a more complete model is needed . Ugolini et al . now report improvements to a small device , referred to as a lab-on-chip , that can subject cells to mechanical strain . The improvements mean the device could also recreate other conditions seen early on in damaged heart tissue , specifically the reduced supply of oxygen . Replicating combinations of mechanical changes and oxygen supplies meant that the impact of these conditions on human cardiac fibroblasts could be directly observed in the laboratory for the first time . Ugolini et al . found that a lack of contraction and low oxygen levels triggered the cardiac fibroblasts to produce inflammatory molecules and molecules associated with the formation of scar tissue . This resembles the response seen in living hearts . The next step is to improve the lab-on-chip device further by adding other cell types , including heart muscle cells and immune cells . A more complete model may aid future research into how our hearts operate in both health and disease .
Cells contain a large number of proteins that control the activity of genes in response to various signals and changes in their environment . Often these proteins work together in groups called complexes . In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , one of these complexes is called DOMINO . The DOMINO complex alters gene activity by interacting with other proteins called histones which influence how the genes are packaged and accessed within the cell . DOMINO works in two separate ways . First , it can replace certain histones with other variants that regulate genes differently . Second , it can modify histones by adding a chemical marker to them , which alters how they interact with genes . It was not clear how DOMINO can do both of these things and how that is controlled; but it was known that cells can make two different forms of the central component of the complex , called DOM-A and DOM-B , which are both encoded by the same gene . Scacchetti et al . have now studied fruit flies to understand the activities of these forms . This revealed that they do have different roles and that gene activity in cells changes if either one is lost . The two forms operate as part complexes with different compositions and only DOM-A includes the TIP60 enzyme that is needed to modify histones . As such , it seems that DOM-B primarily replaces histones with variant forms , while DOM-A modifies existing histones . This means that each form has a unique role associated with each of the two known behaviors of this complex . The presence of two different DOMINO complexes is common to flies and , probably , other insects . Yet , in other living things , such as mammals and yeast , their two roles are carried out by protein complexes originating from two distinct genes . This illustrates a concept called convergent evolution , where different organisms find different solutions for the same problem . As such , these findings provide an insight into the challenges encountered through evolution and the diverse solutions that have developed . They will also help us to understand the ways in which protein activities can adapt to different needs over evolutionary time .
Motor nerves are like electrical wires that connect our spinal cord to the muscles in our body . These nerves communicate with muscles across a connection called the neuromuscular junction . To first form a neuromuscular junction , the motor nerves and muscles each produce molecular cues that tell each other to do their part to build a connection . Beta-catenin in the muscle is known to regulate motor nerve development . However , beta-catenin has two different roles: it helps to coordinate whether neighboring cells stick together , and it can regulate which genes are ‘transcribed’ to produce proteins . It was not known which of these roles is necessary for forming neuromuscular junctions . Wu , Barik et al . now investigate this question by creating mice with mutant forms of beta-catenin in their muscles . Some mice had muscle beta-catenin that could not help cells stick together , and others had beta-catenin that could not control gene transcription . Only mutations that affected the ability of beta-catenin to control transcription caused abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction . However , these problems could be fixed by adding either normal beta-catenin or the mutant form that cannot help cells stick together . Wu , Barik et al . then used molecular tools to explore which genes are turned on by beta-catenin . The experiments showed that beta-catenin causes muscle fibers to produce a protein called Slit2—a developmental cue that controls where neurons grow . Furthermore , the neuromuscular junction defects found in mice without beta-catenin in their muscles could be reduced by making the muscle fibers produce more Slit2 . However , not all defects in beta-catenin mutant mice are rescued by Slit2 . Future research is needed to identify other beta-catenin-controlled signals and to determine whether such a pathway is altered in neuromuscular disorders .
The intestines , liver , and skin are all examples of organs that perform specific functions . Organs are comprised of tissues , which are themselves made up of cells . Epithelial tissue is one of the four basic types of tissue found in animals , and it occurs in almost every organ in the body . For example , epithelial tissue makes up the outermost layer of the skin , and the lining of the lungs and the intestines; the cells in epithelial tissues are attached to one another via ‘adhesion molecules’ . Organs and tissues need to be maintained throughout life in order for them to work properly . Epithelial cells in particular are very short-lived and must be constantly replaced . If epithelial tissue is cut or damaged in any way , the surrounding healthy epithelial cells must work together to repair the wound and restore the tissue's integrity . These processes require individual epithelial cells to communicate with one another . While chemical signals provide one means of cell-to-cell communication , cells also sense and respond to the physical presence of surrounding cells . In adults , organs and tissues generally do not change shape or size; as such there is a tightly balanced exchange of mechanical forces between the individual cells . Damage to the tissue causes a detectable change in these mechanical forces , which is sensed by nearby healthy epithelial cells and causes them to work towards healing the wound . While the importance of mechanical forces in maintaining tissue integrity is widely recognized , there were few tools to study these forces; this meant that mechanical communication through cell–cell adhesion sites was not well understood . Now Ng , Besser et al . describe the development and use of a new method for measuring and mapping the exchange of mechanical forces at cell–cell adhesion sites . Changes in the strength of the forces exchanged between cells could be measured across clusters of multiple cells or for specific parts of individual cells . Ng , Besser et al . found that when an epithelial cell in a cluster started to divide to form two new cells , the cell exerted less mechanical force on its neighboring cells . Ng , Besser et al . found that the forces exerted between cells were strongest when there was more of an adhesion molecule called E-cadherin in the cell surface membrane at the cell–cell adhesion sites . The opposite was also true , as these forces were weakest at cell–cell adhesion sites with fewer E-cadherin molecules . The new method and findings will now help to guide future studies into how mechanical forces are transmitted between living cells .
Huntington’s disease is an inherited disorder that occurs in adulthood and sometimes in children . It causes progressive damage to the brain and people with the condition develop memory loss , movement difficulties , confusion , and other symptoms of mental decline . Eventually , the disease leads to death . Mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called huntingtin cause Huntington’s disease . Individuals who inherit just one copy of the mutated gene develop the condition . No treatments currently exist that can slow or stop disease progression . Genetic and molecular studies are beginning to shed light on how mutations in the gene encoding huntingtin cause the disease . Normally , the protein has a section near its tail end made up of the amino acid glutamine repeated around 23 times . Mutations that increase the number of glutamines to more than 38 cause Huntington’s disease . The more extra glutamines there are in this region of the protein , the earlier in life the disease symptoms begin . But it was not clear how these extra glutamines near the tail of huntingtin affect the structure and behavior of a protein that is more than 3 , 000 amino acids long . Now , Vijayvargia et al . have revealed why the tail end of huntingtin is so important . Several biophysical methods were used to determine the three-dimensional structure of the huntingtin protein . These methods revealed that the protein folds up into a hollow sphere and that its tail end is able to interact with the entire length of the protein and physically touches its opposite end . To see this in more detail , Vijayvargia et al . used another experimental technique called crosslinking mass spectrometry to confirm which parts of the huntingtin protein are in close contact with each other . Together with the structural data , these experiments suggest that the stretch of glutamines is in the position to bring about subtle , but widespread , changes throughout the huntingtin protein . That is to say , that having more glutamines slightly changes the curve of the sphere and alters the way different parts of the protein interact . Together the new findings explain why mutations that alter the tail of huntingtin affect the rest of the protein . Further work will now aim to provide a more-detailed structure of the huntingtin protein and to investigate what other roles of huntingtin are affected by the increased number of glutamines in the protein’s tail . These insights may help scientists understand how the mutated protein causes brain decline .
The cells of nearly all organisms need iron as this metal plays an important role in a wide range of biological processes . However , iron can also trigger the formation of harmful molecules that can damage cells . It is therefore crucial that the amount of iron in cells is tightly controlled and that any extra iron is safely stored away . Most of the iron in the body is stored within a protein called ferritin , which is then broken down to release iron as it is needed , in a process known as ferritinophagy . Cells use several systems to break down proteins , one of which , called autophagy , has been linked to ferritinophagy . During autophagy , a bubble-like structure called an autophagosome engulfs proteins that need to be removed and delivers them to a compartment in the cell where they can be broken down . In 2014 , researchers showed that a protein called NCOA4 on the surface of autophagosomes targets ferritin for destruction . When iron levels are high in the cell , the amount of NCOA4 on the autophagosomes is low . This leads to fewer ferritin molecules being broken down . In contrast , low iron levels lead to an increase of NCOA4 on autophagosomes , which promotes ferritinophagy and increases the amount of iron in the cell . Now , Mancias , Vaites et al—including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 work—investigate the role of NCOA4 in ferritinophagy in more detail . Biochemical experiments revealed that a region of NCOA4 directly interacts with a particular subunit of ferritin and this interaction is necessary to deliver ferritin to autophagosomes . Mancias , Vaites et al . then used laboratory grown-cells to investigate why the amount of NCOA4 changes in response to the amount of iron in the cell . The experiments show the amount of NCOA4 varies depending on whether it interacts with another protein called HERC2 , which targets proteins for destruction by a structure called the proteasome . HERC2 only binds to NCOA4 when iron levels are high , which leads to NCOA4 being broken down by the proteasome . When iron levels are low , HERC2 does not interact with NCOA4 . The presence of more NCOA4 then leads to more ferritinophagy , and so increases the amount of iron in the cell . Mancias , Vaites et al . also found that red blood cells , which depend highly on iron , do not develop properly in zebrafish that have lower amounts of the NCOA4 protein . Further work is needed to see whether NCOA4 is also important for the development of other cells and tissues .
Part of the brain called the lateral prefrontal cortex has a critical role in many of the processes seen as hallmarks of human cognition , such as reasoning , planning and problem-solving . Individuals with damage to the lateral prefrontal cortex are disorganized and easily distracted , and may show behaviors that are inappropriate for their context . However , the involvement of the lateral prefrontal cortex in such a wide range of processes makes it difficult to study . This in turn presents a significant roadblock to a full understanding of cognition and human intelligence . Of particular interest is whether the lateral prefrontal cortex has a hierarchical organization wherein a region coordinates the roles of other regions , much like the chief executive of a company . Therefore , Nee and D’Esposito set out to map how the lateral prefrontal cortex is organized , and how its different regions communicate with each other to support complex cognition . Brain imaging revealed that the rear ( posterior ) part of the lateral prefrontal cortex processes an individual’s current situation , while the front ( anterior ) prepares for future situations . Areas in the middle process both types of information . These central areas appear to be highly influential as they have stronger connections to the anterior and posterior regions than vice versa . In cognitively demanding situations , the middle areas receive input from both anterior regions ( potentially about future needs ) and posterior regions ( potentially about current needs ) . By combining the two sets of information , the middle areas can select behaviors that take into account both present circumstances and longer-term goals . With this strategic overview , the middle areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex are well positioned to play the part of the brain’s chief executive . Future experiments should test whether the interactions observed between the different regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex are essential for complex planning and thinking . Additional work in animals would improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these interactions . Finally , studying how these interactions are altered in disorders such as schizophrenia , where the lateral prefrontal cortex shows abnormal activity , might pave the way for more effective treatments .
The outer layer of the mammalian brain the cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory , attention , awareness and thought . While rodents have a smooth cortical surface , the cortex of larger mammals such as primates is organized into folds and furrows . These folds increase the amount of cortex that can fit inside the confines of the skull , and are thought to have allowed the evolution of more advanced thought processes . Mutations in various genes are likely to have contributed to the expansion and folding of the cortex . These mutations may not always have involved changes in the instructions encoded within the genes , but might instead have involved changes in the number of copies of a gene . One plausible candidate gene is TBC1D3 , which is only found in the great apes and is active in the cortex . The chimpanzee genome contains a single copy of TBC1D3 whereas the human genome contains multiple copies . Ju , Hou et al . have now shown that introducing the TBC1D3 gene into mouse embryos triggers changes in the embryonic cortex . Specifically , this gene increases the number of a type of cell called the outer radial glial cell in the cortex . These cells give rise to new neurons , and are usually rare in mice but abundant in the brains of animals with a folded cortex . Additional experiments using samples of human brain tissue confirmed that TBC1D3 is required for the outer radial glial cells to form . The samples were collected from miscarried fetuses with the informed consent of the patients and following approved protocols and ethical guidelines . Finally , introducing the TBC1D3 gene into the mouse genome also gave rise to animals with a folded cortex , rather than their usual smooth brain surface . Further work is now required to identify how TBC1D3 helps to generate outer radial glial cells , and to work out how these cells cause the cortex to expand . Testing the behavior of mice with the TBC1D3 gene could also uncover the links between cortical folding and thought processes .
Plant diseases cause devastating crop losses around the world and threaten the food supply of millions of people . Over time , plants have developed various mechanisms for fighting off infections caused by pests and other pathogens such as viruses and bacteria . When plants become infected they kick their immune system into action by rapidly switching on and off certain genes . They do this by activating the protein NPR1 which regulates the plant’s immune genes . NPR1 is essential for fighting off infections and plants that do not have this protein are highly susceptible to disease . Peculiarly , once the plant has detected an infection it builds resistance by destroying the NPR1 protein . A previous study suggested that plants do this to replace old ‘inactive’ NPR1 with newer versions that can activate the genes needed to stop the disease developing . This process , however , requires a lot of energy that could be re-directed to other aspects of the immune response . Now , Skelly et al . – including one of the researchers involved in the previous study – have explored whether there may be other reasons for why plants destroy the NPR1 protein . Plant cells target NPR1 for destruction by repeatedly tagging it with molecules called ubiquitin to form ubiquitin chains . The length of these chains determines whether a protein is stable and ready for action , or whether it is ready to be destroyed . In experiments with a commonly studied plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana , Skelly et al . found that the length of ubiquitin chains attached to the NPR1 protein could fine-tune its level of activity: short ubiquitin chains activate NPR1 , while longer chains lead to its destruction and shut down the protein . This suggests that the steps leading to the destruction of NPR1 regulate the immune genes needed to fight off disease . This work has uncovered important new components of how plants defend themselves from infection . If these findings translate to crop plants they could inform future agricultural strategies for enhancing the plant’s own defences to increase crop yields , which would provide more food for a rapidly growing population .
Genes contain instructions for processes in cells and therefore their activities must be carefully controlled . The addition of small chemical tags called methyl groups to DNA is one of the many ways by which cells can influence gene activity . These methyl groups can silence genes by altering the DNA so that is more tightly packed within the nucleus of the cell . Virus genes and mobile sections of DNA called transposable elements ( sometimes known as jumping genes ) are also silenced by DNA methylation to keep them from doing harm . In plants , methyl groups can be attached to DNA by proteins that are guided to the DNA by molecules called short interfering ribonucleic acids ( or siRNAs for short ) . Each siRNA is made of a chain of 24 building blocks called nucleotides and is able to bind to matching RNA molecules that are attached to the target DNA . The siRNAs are made from longer RNA molecules in a process that involves trimming by an enzyme called DCL3 . However , it is not clear how long these “precursor” molecules are before DCL3 cuts them down to size . Here , Blevins , Podicheti et al . studied how siRNAs are made in a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana . The experiments show that RNAs containing around 26-45 nucleotides accumulate in cells that lack DCL3 and these cells are unable to make 24 nucleotide long siRNAs . Furthermore , the purified DCL3 enzyme can cut these precursor RNAs to make the siRNAs . Because the precursors are relatively short , the experiments suggest that DCL3 only cuts each precursor RNA once when making siRNAs . Blevins , Podicheti et al . also show that the siRNA precursors are made by a partnership of two RNA synthesizing enzymes . Therefore , a challenge for the future will be to understand exactly how they work together .
It can take several months , or even years , for the brain of a young animal to develop and refine the complex neural networks which underpin cognitive abilities such as memory , planning , and decision making . While the properties that support these functions have been well-documented , less is known about how they emerge during development . Domínguez , Ma , Yu et al . therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice , using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups . The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains . The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth . Just before , however , the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation . After this pause , neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults . By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors , Domínguez , Ma , Yu et al . showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life , suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species . Overall , the relative lull in activity before transition may mark when neural networks gain mature properties; in the future , it could therefore potentially be used to diagnose and monitor individuals with delayed cognitive development .
Malaria is an infectious disease that is estimated to kill more than half a million people every year , mostly young children in Africa . It is spread by mosquitos that are infected with Plasmodium parasites that attack red blood cells in the human body . Plasmodium falciparum , the species that is responsible for most of these deaths , causes malaria by entering red blood cells and releasing antigens that travel to the surface of the cells , where they change the adhesion properties . This causes the infected red blood cells to accumulate in small blood vessels , surface capillaries or the brain , which can have severe consequences for the person infected . P . falciparum is particularly dangerous because of its ability to vary the antigens displayed on the cell surface: this process , known as antigenic variation , helps to maintain infections for extended periods of time by allowing the antigens to stay one step ahead of the immune system ( a process known as immune escape ) . The origins of antigenic variation lie in the fact that each P . falciparum genome has a repertoire of between 50 and 60 var genes that code for the variability of a major antigen that is responsible for immune escape in malaria . Molecular sequencing has shown that local parasite populations contain thousands of different types of var genes: hence , meiotic recombination in the mosquito can create a vast number of combinations of var repertoires . Artzy-Randrup et al . have developed a computational model of this highly diverse and complex system to address the following question: is a local pathogen population composed of largely random and ephemeral repertoires of these genes , or is it structured into independently circulating strains ? Their model goes beyond previous models by including interactions within the local host population that arise as a result of indirect competition between different strains of the pathogen for available hosts: this competition is influenced by the history of infection and , therefore , by the patterns of immunity within the host population . Previous models included within-host processes but not these higher , local population-level interactions . The model simulates the dynamics of all the unique combinations of var genes in a population of hosts , and shows that even with high rates of reproduction , the parasite population self-organizes into a limited number of coexisting strains: the distinct var repertoires of these strains only weakly overlap , suggesting that the immune response of the host population has been partitioned into distinct niches . By investigating genetic variation at both antigenic sites and regions of the genome that do not code for antigens , Artzy-Randrup et al . suggest that immune selection—the selection imposed on var repertoires by the build up of specific immunity at the population level—plays a central role in structuring parasite diversity . The new model should lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology of Plasmodium and other pathogens that work in similar ways , including Trypanosoma brucei ( sleeping sickness ) , Borellia burgdorferi ( Lyme disease ) and Giardia lamblia ( gastroenteritis ) , and help with global efforts to eliminate malaria and other diseases .
Shigella is a highly infectious group of bacteria that attack the human digestive tract , causing severe and often deadly diarrhoea , especially in children . There is currently no vaccine to protect against the disease , and some strains are also now resistant to antibiotics . People get infected by eating or drinking contaminated foods and water . After passing through the stomach , Shigella invades and then multiplies in the lining of the intestine , eventually causing tissue damage and irritation . During this process , Shigella ‘hides’ from its host’s immune system by blocking how intestinal cells respond to infection . Normally , infected cells send out chemical signals that act like a call for help , attracting specialised immune cells to clear the infection . In intestinal cells , two proteins called UBC13 and TRAF6 work together to switch on this response . Specifically , TRAF6 needs to bind to UBC13 for the switch to turn on . Like many proteins , UBC13 is formed of thousands of atoms; some of these are organized in ‘functional groups’ , a collection of atoms joined in a specific manner and with special chemical properties . During Shigella infection , the bacteria produce an enzyme that changes a single functional group ( an amino group ) at a specific location within UBC13 for a different one ( an hydroxyl group ) . Previous research showed that this could stop the immune response in intestinal cells , but the mechanism remained unknown . Mohanty et al . therefore set out to determine exactly how a change of so few atoms could have such a dramatic effect . Biochemical studies using purified proteins revealed that Shigella’s alteration to UBC13 did not change its overall structure . However , the altered protein could no longer bind to its partner TRAF6 . Theoretical analysis and computer simulations revealed that the normal binding process relies on a positively charged amino acid ( one of the protein’s building blocks ) in UBC13 and a negatively charged one in TRAF6 being attracted to each other . Shigella’s substitution , however , introduces a second negatively charged amino acid in UBC13 . This ‘steals’ the positively charged amino acid that would normally interact with TRAF6: the electrical attraction between the two proteins is disrupted , and this stops them from binding . The work by Mohanty et al . reveals the exact mechanism Shigella uses to dampen its host’s immune response during infection . In the future , this knowledge could be used to develop more effective drugs that would help control outbreaks of diarrhoea .
The brain processes information through the activity of many different types of neurons . A common assumption is that we can work out the role of each type of neuron by increasing or decreasing its activity experimentally and observing the consequences . Imagine , for example , that increasing the activity of a group of neurons boosts the formation of memories , whereas decreasing their activity has the opposite effect . Can we conclude that the natural role of those neurons is to support memory formation ? This question has become increasingly pertinent in recent years , as advances in molecular genetic techniques such as optogenetics have made it easier to experimentally manipulate the activity of neurons . However , the ease with which these experiments can be done masks how difficult it can be to interpret the results . To test the assumption that dialing a neuron’s activity up or down provides a straightforward readout of its role in the brain , Phillips and Hasenstaub used optogenetics to inactivate two types of neurons in an area of the mouse brain responsible for processing sound . Inactivating each cell type produced different outcomes . The standard way of interpreting these results is to conclude that the neurons must therefore have different , separable roles . However , using optogenetics to increase the activity of the neurons revealed no such differences in the neurons’ roles . Using a computer model , Phillips and Hasenstaub showed that relatively small changes in factors such as the spontaneous activity of the neurons can affect the outcome of the experiments . Under certain circumstances , the two types of neurons respond in the same way to activation and inactivation; under other circumstances , they respond differently . The results presented by Phillips and Hasenstaub remind us that the conclusions we draw about a neuron’s role can be sensitive to how the cell was manipulated . Future studies should address how other aspects of experimental manipulations , such as their timing or pattern , affect the apparent behavior of neurons .
Like an orchestra that relies on the coordinated efforts of its members , the brain depends on its many regions working together to perform tasks such as memorizing a phone number or the name of someone we recently met . Many areas in the brain that are involved in these processes are located far apart , and so performing these tasks efficiently depends on the regions being able to communicate and coordinate information . Rhythmic waves of electrical activity in the brain are considered to be essential to maintain the flow of information . These brain waves occur when many brain cells repeatedly send signals at the same time , and the precise ‘beat’ of the signals might be especially important when performing more complex tasks . In recent years , cheap and safe electrical stimulation has shown promise in being able to influence brain waves . This technique can be used to investigate the importance of precise timing between brain waves and its impact on performing tasks , as well as changes in brain activity that occur when tasks are more complex . For example , is a person’s behaviour affected if electrical stimulation is used to make their brain waves more or less synchronized ? Violante et al . stimulated distant regions of the brain of volunteers and monitored how they performed in tasks with varying difficulty . When these regions were stimulated with the same ‘beat’ to make the brain waves more synchronized , the person performed better in the more difficult tasks . In these tasks , participants had to monitor number sequences , and spot repeated patterns in the remembered information . To better understand this effect Violante et al . performed brain stimulation while collecting brain scans . The scans showed that stimulation at the same ‘beat’ increases brain activity in the regions involved in task performance and changes the pattern of how regions communicate in the brain . This finding suggests that the ‘beat’ of brain waves is important for task performance , and that stimulating the brain externally can alter how regions in the brain communicate . Future studies could extend these findings to patients , particularly those with the kind of damage to their brain that slows the communication between its distant regions . Stimulating these patients’ brains could help bypass the internal delays , and help them to complete everyday tasks more efficiently .
In warm-blooded animals , including chickens and humans , a single embryo can give rise to several separate individuals ( identical twins ) . Some species of armadillos routinely give birth to quadruplets in this way—and in experiments , up to eight identical chick embryos can be produced by cutting one embryo into smaller pieces ( a type of ‘experimental twinning’ ) . This ability of a developing embryo to subdivide into separate individuals ends when the embryo starts to form its first midline structure , called the ‘primitive streak’ . This is the first line of symmetry and defines where the head–tail axis will later develop . The steps that establish the axes of the embryo in birds and mammals , and the factors that prevent further splitting of the embryo to form twins after this point , are only just beginning to be understood . In chick embryos , the production of a protein called cVg1 is the first known step and precedes the development of a line of symmetry . A similar protein is produced in mammalian embryos and both proteins are members of an important family of signalling proteins . Now , Torlopp , Khan et al . have used a combination of techniques to search for other proteins that that control the production of the cVg1 protein . Genes that are active in the region of the embryo that will express cVg1 later in development were identified , both in normal embryos and during the process of experimental twinning . This search revealed Pitx2 as a protein that acts to switch on the expression of the gene that encodes cVg1 . When the Pitx2 protein is removed , the embryonic axis forms from the opposite side . Next , Torlopp , Khan et al . searched the chicken genome to identify stretches of DNA around the cVg1 gene where proteins that regulate gene expression might bind . Six potential sites were found , including four to which Pitx2 can bind . Further experiments confirmed that two of these regulatory sequences encourage the expression of the cVg1 gene at its correct position in the embryo . Pitx2 and related proteins were known to be involved with the development of left–right symmetry later in development; the findings of Torlopp , Khan et al . reveal , unexpectedly , that these proteins are also involved in first establishing the position at which the midline of the embryo will arise . It remains unclear what prevents most embryos from forming twins . But Torlopp , Khan et al . 's findings could help to explain some strange observations , made long ago , about left–right asymmetry in identical twins . For example , they could help explain why one of the twins in an identical twin pair is more likely to be left-handed than an individual in the general population , and why the direction of whorls of hair on the back of the head is often mirrored between identical twins .
Fruit flies are attracted to the smell of rotting fruit , and use it to guide them to nearby food sources . However , this task is made more challenging by the fact that the distribution of scent or odor molecules in the air is constantly changing . Fruit flies therefore need to cope with , and exploit , this variation if they are to use odors as cues . Odor molecules bind to receptors on the surface of nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons , and trigger nerve impulses that travel along these cells . The olfactory sensory neurons are connected to other cells called projection neurons that in turn relay information to the higher centers of the brain . While many studies have investigated how fruit flies can distinguish between different odors , less is known about how animals can use variation in the strength of an odor to guide them towards its source . Kim et al . have now addressed this question by devising a method for delivering precise quantities of odors in controlled patterns to fruit flies , and then measuring the responses of olfactory sensory neurons and projection neurons . These experiments revealed that olfactory sensory neurons—which are found mainly in the flies' antennae—responded most strongly whenever an odor changed rapidly in strength , and showed relatively little response to constant odors . An independent study by Schulze , Gomez-Marin et al . found that olfactory sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae also respond in a similar way . Kim et al . also found that the response of the projection neurons depended on both the rate of nerve impulses in the olfactory sensory neurons and on how quickly this rate was changing . But , unlike the olfactory sensory neurons , projection neurons showed their strongest responses immediately after an odor first appeared . Thus , in contrast to organisms such as bacteria and worms , which are highly sensitive to the local concentration gradients of odors , fruit flies instead appear to be more responsive to the sudden appearance of an odor in their environment . Kim et al . suggest that this difference may reflect the fact that for ground-based organisms , local gradients are generally reliable predictors of the location of an odor source . However , for flying insects , continually changing air currents mean that predictable local gradients are less common . Therefore , the ability to detect a hint of an odor before the wind changes is a more useful skill .
The seeds of rice , wheat and other flowering plants store a variety of nutrients , largely in the form of sugars , proteins and oils . These stored reserves provide the main source of calories for humans and livestock all over the world , so they are of major social and economic importance . Seed development is an intricate process . It begins after male sperm cells fuse with female gametes inside the flower . This leads to the formation of the embryo , which will develop into a new plant , and a structure called the endosperm , which nourishes the growing embryo . A protective seed coat surrounds the embryo and endosperm , which develops from certain parts of the parent flower . In order for the seed to develop successfully , these three components have to communicate so they can coordinate their growth . Auxin is a key plant hormone that is needed for plants to grow and develop properly and is necessary for the endosperm to form . Previous research has shown that the endosperm is also required to trigger the formation of the seed coat , but the signal that triggers this process has not yet been identified . Figueiredo et al . now address this question in a small flowering plant called Arabidopsis thaliana . The experiments show that the endosperm produces auxin , which acts as a molecular signal for the seed coat to start forming . Exposing unfertilized flowers to auxin caused a seed coat to form even though the endosperm was absent . This suggests that this hormone alone is sufficient to trigger the formation of the seed coat without any other signals . Further analysis revealed that a protein called AGL62 regulates the movement of auxin to the parts of the flower that give rise to the seed coat . In the absence of AGL62 , the hormone remains trapped in the endosperm and the seed coat fails to develop . The next step following on from this work is to understand how auxin moves from the endosperm to the parts of the flower that form the seed coat .
Bacteria can cause diseases , but they also battle their own microscopic enemies: a group of viruses known as bacteriophages . For instance , the T7 bacteriophage preys on various strains of Escherichia coli , a type of bacteria often found in the human gut . While many E . coli strains are inoffensive or even beneficial to human health , some can be deadly . Finding a way to kill harmful strains while sparing the helpful ones would be a helpful addition to the medicine toolkit . Bacteriophages identify and interact with their specific target through a structure known as the receptor binding protein , or RBP . However , it is still unclear exactly how RBP helps the viruses recognize which type of bacteria to infect . Here , Huss et al . set to map out and modify this structure in T7 bacteriophage so the virus is more efficient and specific about which strain of E . coli it kills . First , the role of each building block in the tip of RBP was meticulously dissected; this generated the knowledge required to genetically engineer a large number of different T7 bacteriophages , each with a slightly variation in their RBP . These viruses were then exposed to various strains of bacteria . Monitoring the bacteriophages that survived and multiplied the most after infecting different strains of E . coli revealed which RBP building blocks are important for efficiency and specificity . This was then confirmed by engineering highly active T7 bacteriophage variants against an E . coli strain that causes urinary tract infections . These findings demonstrate that even small changes to the bacteriophages can make a big difference to their ability to infect their preys . The approaches developed by Huss et al . help to understand exactly how the RBP allows a virus to infect a specific type of bacteria; this could one day pave the way for new therapies that harness those viruses to fight increasingly resistant bacterial infections .
Spoken language is colored by fluctuations in pitch and rhythm . Rather than speaking in a flat monotone , we allow our sentences to rise and fall . We vary the length of syllables , drawing out some , and shortening others . These fluctuations , known as prosody , add emotion to speech and denote punctuation . In written language , we use a comma or a period to signal a boundary between phrases . In speech , we use changes in pitch – how deep or sharp a voice sounds – or in the length of syllables . Having more than one type of cue that can signal emotion or transitions between sentences has a number of advantages . It means that people can understand each other even when factors such as background noise obscure one set of cues . It also means that people with impaired sound perception can still understand speech . Those with a condition called congenital amusia , for example , struggle to perceive pitch , but they can compensate for this difficulty by placing greater emphasis on other aspects of speech . Jasmin et al . showed how the brain achieves this by comparing the brain activities of people with and without amusia . Participants were asked to read sentences on a screen where a comma indicated a boundary between two phrases . They then heard two spoken sentences , and had to choose the one that matched the written sentence . The spoken sentences used changes in pitch and/or syllable duration to signal the position of the comma . This provided listeners with the information needed to distinguish between "after John runs the race , . . . " and "after John runs , the race . . . " , for example . When two brain regions communicate , they tend to increase their activity at around the same time . The brain regions are then said to show functional connectivity . Jasmin et al . found that compared to healthy volunteers , people with amusia showed less functional connectivity between left hemisphere brain regions that process language and right hemisphere regions that process pitch . In other words , because pitch is a less reliable source of information for people with amusia , they recruit pitch-related brain regions less when processing speech . These results add to our understanding of how brains compensate for impaired perception . This may be useful for understanding the neural basis of compensation in other clinical conditions . It could also help us design bespoke hearing aids or other communication devices , such as computer programs that convert text into speech . Such programs could tailor the pitch and rhythm characteristics of the speech they produce to suit the perception of individual users .
While cancer cells typically cannot spread between individuals , there are a few examples of contagious tumours . Remarkably , two examples have emerged in a single species , the Tasmanian devil , a marsupial carnivore . These tumours are known as Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( or DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( or DFT2 ) ; both cause tumours round the faces of infected devils . Since it emerged in the 1990s , DFT1 has killed 60–90% of the devil population . Preserving the few remaining healthy devils has been a major challenge for conservationists . This challenge became more urgent in 2014 , when the second contagious cancer , DFT2 , was discovered circulating in the population . Contagious cancers are rare because the immune system usually eliminates cells coming from outside the body . Each healthy cell carries molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) that act as a barcode showing where each cell comes from . The immune system uses these molecules to help it tell the difference between the body’s own cells and those from elsewhere . DFT1 can avoid the immune system and spread to new hosts because it has lost MHC . In 2014 , scientists identified a new Tasmanian devil cancer named DFT2 , but it was unclear how this second cancer evades the immune system as it spreads from host to host . Caldwell et al . have now examined the MHC on cells from DFT2 cancers , including cells grown in the laboratory and cells taken from cancer biopsies . Biochemical tests showed that the DFT2 cells do carry MHCs , but that the MHC barcodes of DFT2 are similar to those of the devils infected with the disease . This finding may explain how the cancer can spread undetected in these animals , because the immune system does not recognize it as coming from outside the body . Further analyses also reveal that the cancer cells are slowly evolving to lose their MHCs . This means DFT2 could , with time , become as contagious as DFT1 . These two contagious cancers threaten the future of the Tasmanian devil . As top predators , devils are key to the ecosystem in Tasmania and their preservation is vital . While DFT2 provides a unique opportunity to study an emerging cancer as it develops , this research will also help to protect the devils and may lead to effective vaccines . These results could also reveal how other cancers avoid the immune system and may help to detect them during treatment . In addition , there are many similarities between contagious cancer cells and organ transplants . Understanding the role of MHC in DFT2 could lead to better ways to prevent rejection following transplants .
Sitting in your car , about to drive home after a long day at work , you realize you have no idea which way to go: you recognize where you are right now , and you remember the name of the street your house is on , but you cannot figure out how to get there . This spatial disorientation happens to people with damage to a brain region called the retrosplenial cortex , whose role and inner workings remain poorly understood . Recent evidence has shown that this area contains ‘low-rheobase’ neurons which are not seen anywhere else in the brain , but what do these neurons do ? Brennan , Jedrasiak-Cape , Kailasa et al . decided to explore the role of these neurons , focusing on the brain regions they are connected to . Experiments were conducted in mice using optogenetics , a technique that activates neurons using pulses of light . This revealed that brain areas involved in processing information about direction and position preferentially communicate with low-rheobase neurons rather than with nearby , more standard neurons in the retrosplenial cortex . The way these spatial signals are sent to the low-rheobase neurons allows these cells to ‘calculate’ how fast a mouse is turning its head using only information about which direction the mouse is facing . Essentially , this neuron can turn directional compass-like signals into a gyroscope signal that can track both direction and speed of head movement . These unique neurons may therefore be ideally suited to combine information about direction and space , suggesting that they may have evolved specifically to support spatial navigation . Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease show exactly the same type of spatial disorientation as individuals with direct damage to the retrosplenial cortex . This region is also one of the first to show altered activity in Alzheimer’s disease . Exploring whether these unique retrosplenial neurons and their communication patterns are altered in Alzheimer’s disease models could help to understand and potentially treat this debilitating condition .
Traumatic brain injury can result from direct head concussions , rapid head movements , or a blast wave generated by an explosion . Traumatic brain injury often causes seizures in the short term and is a risk factor for certain dementias , including Alzheimer’s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in the long term . A protein called Tau undergoes a series of chemical changes in these dementias that makes it accumulate , form toxic filaments and kill neurons . The toxic abnormal Tau proteins are initially found only in certain regions of the brain , but they spread as the disease progresses . Previous studies in Alzheimer’s disease and other diseases where Tau proteins are abnormal suggest that Tau can spread between neighboring neurons and this can be promoted by neuron activity . However , scientists do not know whether similar mechanisms are at work following traumatic brain injury . Given that seizures are very common following traumatic brain injury , could they be partly responsible for promoting dementia ? To investigate this , researchers need animal models in which they can measure neural activity associated with traumatic brain injury and observe the spread of abnormal Tau proteins . Alyenbaawi et al . engineered zebrafish so that their Tau proteins would be fluorescent , making it possible to track the accumulation of aggregated Tau protein in the brain . Next , they invented a simple way to perform traumatic brain injury on zebrafish larvae by using a syringe to produce a pressure wave . After this procedure , many of the fish exhibited features consistent with progression towards dementia , and seizure-like behaviors . The results showed that post-traumatic seizures are linked to the spread of aggregates of abnormal Tau following traumatic brain injury . Alyenbaawi et al . also found that anticonvulsant drugs can lower the levels of abnormal Tau proteins in neurons , preventing cell death , and could potentially ameliorate dementias associated with traumatic brain injury . These drugs are already being used to prevent post-traumatic epilepsy , but more research is needed to confirm whether they reduce the risk or severity of Tau-related neurodegeneration .
People differ a lot from one another in terms of their personality , behaviour and lifestyle . This individuality is attributed to the different regions in the brain , and the strength of communication between them . The connectivity pattern between these areas is thought to be as unique as a fingerprint . If the connections are weak or disrupted it can play a role in conditions such as schizophrenia , depression or Alzheimer’s disease . It is thought that the strength of the connection depends on how strongly the nerve cells in these regions communicate . But are these individual differences solely caused by different strengths of connection , or could other factors contribute to them ? Now , Bijsterbosch et al . found that the size , shape and exact position of the brain regions was also strongly linked to the different behaviours of individuals . The study used brain scans , behavioural tests and questionnaires from a large database about lifestyle choices and demographics , to analyse the relationship between the different brain features of healthy individuals . The results showed that the variations in the brain regions were linked to many behavioural factors including intelligence , life satisfaction , drug use and aggression problems . Moreover , Bijsterbosch et al . showed that the existing methods for estimating the strength of connection between brain regions could reveal more about the spatial layout of these regions than the actual connection strength between them . This suggests that new approaches are needed to properly evaluate the strength of the connections . Some psychiatric and neurological diseases may be associated with changes in size and position of the different regions in the brain . In future , the findings of this study could be applied to individuals affected by such conditions , to see if the location of a region could be used as a diagnostic indicator .
The muscles that allow animal’s to move are built predominantly of cells called myofibers . Like other specialized cell types , these myofibers develop via a regulated set of events called differentiation . In adults , this phenomenon occurs when muscles regenerate after an injury , and new myofibers differentiate from so-called satellite cells that already reside within the muscles . Differentiation is regulated at the genetic level , and the development of myofibers relies on the activation of muscle-specific genes . A gene’s expression is typically controlled via a nearby regulatory region of DNA called a promoter that can be recognized by various molecular machines made from protein complexes . In most adult tissues , such regulatory machineries contain a complex called TFIID . Previously it was reported that the TFIID complex was eliminated from cells during muscle differentiation , and that an alternative protein complex called TBP2/TAF3 recognizes and regulates the promoters of muscle-specific genes . However , Malecova et al . have now discovered that TFIID is actually present , albeit at reduced amounts , in differentiated muscles and that it drives the activation of muscle-specific genes during differentiation . Further experiments also showed that the TBP2 protein is not required for differentiation of muscle cells or for the regeneration of injured muscles , and is actually absent in muscle cells . Further studies are now needed to explore how the TFIID-containing complex works with other regulatory protein complexes that are known to help make muscle-specific genes accessible to TFIID . It will also be important to study the relationship between the down-regulation of TFIID components and the activation of muscle-specific genes that typically occurs in mature myofbers . Together these efforts will allow the various aspects of gene regulation to be integrated , which will help provide a more complete understanding of the process of muscle differentiation .
From riding a bike to reaching for a cup of coffee , all skilled actions rely on precise connections between the sensory and motor areas of the brain . While sensory areas receive and analyse input from the senses , motor areas plan and trigger muscle contractions . Precisely adjusting the connections between these and other areas enables us to learn new skills , and it also helps us to relearn skills lost as a result of brain injury or stroke . About 70 years ago , a psychologist named Donald Hebb came up with an idea for how this process might occur . He proposed that whenever two neurons are active at the same time , the connection between them becomes stronger . This idea , that ‘cells that fire together , wire together’ , became known as Hebb’s rule . Many studies have since shown that Hebb’s rule can explain changes in the strength of connections between pairs of neurons . But can it also explain how connections between entire brain regions become stronger or weaker ? New results show that it can . The data were obtained using a technique called optogenetics , in which viruses are used to introduce genes for light-sensitive proteins into neurons . Shining light onto the brain will then activate any cells within that area that contain the resulting proteins . Yazdan-Shahmorad , Silversmith et al . used this technique to activate small regions of either sensory or motor brain tissue in live macaque monkeys . Doing so strengthened the overall connectivity between the two areas . The effects were more variable at the level of smaller brain regions , with some connections becoming weaker rather than stronger . However , Yazdan-Shahmorad , Silversmith et al . show that Hebb’s rule explains most of the observed changes . Many neurological and psychiatric disorders stem from abnormal brain connectivity . Simple forms of brain stimulation are already used to treat certain neurological disorders , such as Parkinson’s disease . Stimulating the brain to induce specific changes in connectivity may ultimately enable us to leverage the brain’s natural learning mechanisms to cure , instead of just treat , these conditions .
Vision depends on the brain as well as on the eyes . Almost all information from the eyes travels to a brain region called the primary visual cortex . This large expanse of tissue at the back of the brain contains a detailed map of the visual world . Adults who suffer damage to part of the primary visual cortex become blind in the corresponding area of visual space , a phenomenon known as cortical blindness . Yet , adults with cortical blindness can also experience ‘blindsight’: they can still point correctly to bright , moving images , even though they claim they cannot see them . One of the roles of primary visual cortex is to act as a gateway to other , ‘higher’ visual areas of the brain . These regions process the input they receive from the primary visual cortex to generate a rich and coherent visual representation . But how do adults with blindsight , in whom the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual areas has been damaged , still manage to respond to visual stimuli ? By chance , Bridge et al . discovered a monkey whose unusual brain anatomy provides clues as to why this is possible . The monkey behaved much like its peers , leaping between the perches of its enclosure with ease . But when Bridge et al . tried to train the animal on a visual task , it proved unable to learn like the other monkeys . A brain scan revealed that it had almost no primary visual cortex , probably because of an abnormality that arose early in development . Further studies of the monkey’s brain showed that the other structures involved in visual processing were in their usual places and were of normal size . Connections from the eyes to higher visual areas that bypass the primary visual cortex were normal , but were no stronger than in other monkeys . In fact , areas beyond the primary visual cortex showed no fundamental changes in how they processed visual information . The brain of this monkey had thus adapted to early loss of the major gateway from the eyes to higher visual cortex . Visual areas of the brain beyond the primary visual cortex continued to work as normal , helping to minimize vision loss . Because the visual brain differs little between primates , this discovery could also benefit patients with blindsight . It suggests that targeting higher visual areas could further improve vision in patients with damage to the primary visual cortex .
The immune system defends us from attacks by viruses , bacteria and other microbes . One way that the immune system can identify these invaders is by detecting genetic material from the microbes . Like us , many of these microbes have genetic material made of a two-stranded molecule called DNA . A protein called IFI16 is an important sensor in immune cells that can bind to foreign DNA , but not to the DNA of the host . If the ability to discriminate between host and foreign DNA is lost , then immune cells start to attack the body’s own tissues , which can lead to severe “autoimmune” diseases . However , it is not clear how IFI16 and other sensor proteins are able to tell foreign and host DNA apart . DNA in host cells is packaged in particular proteins to form structures called nucleosomes that can make it difficult for other proteins to bind to the DNA . When foreign DNA enters the cell , IFI16 promotes the formation of nucleosomes on these molecules , but the nucleosomes are further apart than those in host DNA , which leaves longer stretches of “exposed” DNA between the nucleosomes . In 2014 , a group of researchers reported that multiple molecules of IFI16 associate with each other and form clusters on exposed foreign DNA . Here , Stratmann , Morrone et al . – including some of the researchers from the earlier work – investigated how IFI16 selectively binds to foreign DNA using a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques . The experiments show that to start with , a few molecules of IFI16 bind to stretches of exposed foreign DNA and then move along the DNA strands . As more molecules of IFI16 bind to this DNA , they bump into each other and start to form clusters that eventually become immobile . Further experiments show that the more tightly packed nucleosomes in host DNA molecules act as a barrier to IFI16 cluster formation because they interfere with the ability of the protein to move along the DNA . Stratmann , Morrone et al . ’s findings show that IFI16 can only trigger immune responses when it binds to stretches of exposed DNA that are long enough to allow the assembly of IFI16 clusters . The next challenge will be to see whether other DNA sensors employ similar strategies to detect foreign DNA .
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease affect millions of people worldwide . In many of these diseases , toxic proteins accumulate in the brain and build up as small ‘plaques’ in the gaps , or synapses , that cells called neurons communicate across . Eventually , the plaques prevent the neurons signaling to each other correctly , leading to problems such as memory loss . Identifying the proteins present in plaques is technically challenging , partly because the plaques are very small . Hadley , Rakhit et al . have now developed a new method called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( or STOMP ) that can collect proteins from small areas of cells . In this method , plaques are identified under a light microscope , and their contents are attached to a molecule called a photo-affinity tag using lasers . The photo-tagged proteins are then pulled out using beads that specifically bind to the photo-affinity tag . The proteins can then be identified using a well-established method called mass spectrometry . Hadley , Rakhit et al . used STOMP to analyze plaques present in the brains of mice that develop similar symptoms to those seen in humans with Alzheimer's disease . This revealed that these plaques contain more than 50 different proteins , some of which had not previously been found in plaques . In particular , several proteins from the ‘presynaptic’ neuron that sends signals across the synapse were found in the plaques . However , no proteins from the receiving ( ‘postsynaptic’ ) neuron on the other side of the synapse were present in the plaque . Fixed human brain tissue is more difficult to analyze than mouse samples because it is modified for storage . In spite of these issues , Hadley , Rakhit et al . successfully also used STOMP to identify the proteins in human plaques . STOMP can be used to identify the proteins present in any area of a cell and thus has the potential to be widely used by scientists , not just those studying plaques .
For the nervous system to become wired up correctly , neurons within the developing embryo must project over long distances to form connections with remote targets . They do this by lengthening their axons—the ‘cables’ along which electrical signals flow—and some axons in adult humans can grow to be more than 1 metre long . This type of long-range pathfinding activity is particularly common for neurons that control movement , as many of these neurons must establish connections with muscles that are some distance away from the brain . For example , motor neurons in the brainstem form connections with muscles in the face to control facial expressions , while motor neurons in parts of the spinal cord project to muscles in the limbs . Multiple signaling pathways tell the developing axons which direction to grow en route to their final targets . Now , Hua et al . have shown that an evolutionarily conserved protein called Frizzled3 is also involved in this process . In mouse embryos that lacked Frizzled3 , the motor nerves that control breathing and limb movements were thinner than those in normal mice . In the mutant animals , many motor axons failed to form connections with their targets . Instead , these axons came to an abrupt halt midway along their intended paths and the neurons from which they originated died soon afterwards . These experiments support the idea that developing neurons are programmed to die unless their axons progress on the appropriate schedule . As well as increasing our knowledge of the networks of connections that form within the developing mammalian nervous system , the work of Hua et al . provides new insights into some of the molecular mechanisms by which these connections are established .
Much of what is known about genetics has come from studying only a tiny fraction of the genome’s sequence , the part that primarily codes for proteins . But the genome has many other features outside these regions , some of which play an important biological role . Transposable elements – repetitive sequences that are present in many species – make up around half of the mouse genome . They are ‘selfish’ elements , in that the spread of them within the genome does not necessarily benefit the host organism . But sometimes transposable elements can be ‘domesticated’ , and used to the host’s advantage . For example , transposable elements can generate new genes . In other cases , their non-coding sequences can regulate the activity of other nearby genes or even those elsewhere in the genome . It remains unclear to what extent transposable elements have shaped genome regulation throughout evolution . One idea is that the spread of transposable elements can help to establish large regulatory networks – whereby many genes are collectively regulated to produce a specific output . But it has not been fully explored how effective transposable elements are at regulating gene expression . Now , Todd et al . investigate whether particular transposable elements , that are suspected to boost the activity of other genes , are essential for normal gene expression in early mouse development . Todd et al . genetically edited stem cells from the inner and outer layer of the early mouse embryo to find transposable elements that promote gene expression . Whilst some transposable elements were found to be important for gene regulation , not all of the candidates tested were needed to maintain expression levels . To widen the search , several transposable elements were turned off simultaneously by compacting specific stretches of DNA so that they could no longer be activated . When 34 transposable elements were inactivated at once , it emerged that only three transposable elements had a significant impact on gene expression . These findings suggest that whether or not a given transposable element regulates gene expression cannot be predicted solely from profiling the structure and sequence of the genome . This highlights why it is important to interrogate the effect transposable elements have ona gene's role within a cell . Transposable elements are largely disregarded in genomics due to technical difficulties in analysing these repetitive stretches of DNA . But characteristic variations within a population may in part be driven by differences in these parts of the genome , which may also be implicated in diseases such as cancer . Identifying which transposable elements are important for driving gene expression , and linking their actions to specific traits could aid the discovery of important genetic variants .
Plants rely on carbon for their growth and survival: in a process called photosynthesis , they use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen gas . The chemical reactions that make up photosynthesis are powered by a chain of enzymes , and plants must ensure that these enzymes—which are in the leaves of the plant—are supplied with enough carbon dioxide and water . Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters plants through pores in their leaves , but water must be carried up the plant from the roots . The type of photosynthesis used by about 90% of flowering plant species—including tomatoes and rice—is called C3 photosynthesis . The first step in this process begins with an enzyme called RuBisCO , which reacts with carbon dioxide and a substance called RuBP to form molecules that contain three carbon atoms ( hence the name C3 photosynthesis ) . In a hot climate , however , a plant can lose a lot of water through the pores in its leaves: closing these pores allows the plant to retain water , but this also reduces the supply of carbon dioxide . Under these circumstances this causes problems because RuBisCO uses oxygen to break down RuBP , instead of creating sugars , when carbon dioxide is not readily available . To prevent this process , which wastes a lot of energy and resources , some plants—including maize , sugar cane and many other agricultural staples—have evolved an alternative process called C4 photosynthesis . Although it is more complex than C3 photosynthesis , and required many changes to be made to the structure of leaves , C4 photosynthesis has evolved on more than 60 different occasions . In C4 plants , the mesophyll—the region that is associated with the capture of carbon dioxide by RuBisCO in C3 plants—contains high levels of an alternative enzyme called PEPC that converts carbon dioxide molecules into an acid that contains four carbon atoms . To avoid carbon dioxide being captured by both enzymes , C4 plants evolved to relocate RuBisCO from the mesophyll to a second set of cells in an airtight structure known as the bundle sheath . The four-carbon acids produced by PEPC diffuse to the cells in the bundle sheath , where they are broken down into carbon dioxide molecules , and photosynthesis then proceeds as normal . This process allows photosynthesis to continue when the level of carbon dioxide in the leave is low because the plant has closed its pores to retain water . Since C4 plants grow faster than C3 plants , and also require less water , plant biologists would like to introduce certain C4 traits into C3 crop plants . To help with this process , Williams , Johnston et al . have used computational methods to explore how C4 photosynthesis evolved from ancestral C3 plants . This involved investigating the prevalence of 16 traits that are common to C4 plants in a total of 73 species that undergo C3 or C4 photosynthesis ( including 37 species that possess characteristics of both C3 and C4 ) . Williams , Johnston et al . then went on to produce a new mathematical model that represents evolutionary processes as pathways across a multi-dimensional “landscape” . The model shows that traits can be acquired in various orders , and that C4 photosynthesis evolved through a number of independent pathways . Some traits that evolved early in the transitions to C4 photosynthesis influenced how evolution proceeded , providing “foundations” upon which further changes evolved . Interestingly , the structure of the leaf itself appeared to change before any of the photosynthetic enzymes changed . This led Williams , Johnston et al . to conclude that climate change—in particular , the declines in carbon dioxide levels that occurred in prehistoric times—was probably not responsible for the original evolution of C4 photosynthesis . Nevertheless , these results could help with efforts to adapt important C3 crop plants to on-going changes in our climate .
Living organisms need energy to stay alive; in cells , this energy is supplied in the form of a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate , or ATP , a nucleotide that stores energy in the bonds between its three phosphate groups . ATP is present in all living cells and is often referred to as the energy currency of the cell , because it can be easily stored and transported to where it is needed . However , it is unknown why cells rely so heavily on ATP when a highly similar nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate , or GTP , could also act as an energy currency . There are several examples of proteins that originally used GTP and have since evolved to use ATP , but it is not clear why this switch occurred . One suggestion is that ATP is the more readily available nucleotide in the cell . To test this hypothesis , Updegrove , Harke et al . studied a protein that helps bacteria transition into spores , which are hardier and can survive in extreme environments until conditions become favorable for bacteria to grow again . In modern bacteria , this protein uses ATP to provide energy , but it evolved from an ancestral protein that used GTP instead . First , Updegrove , Harke et al . engineered the protein so that it became more similar to the ancestral protein and used GTP instead of ATP . When this was done , the protein gained the ability to break down GTP and release energy from it , but it no longer performed its enzymatic function . This suggests that both the energy released and the source of that energy are important for a protein’s activity . Further analysis showed that the modern version of the protein has evolved to briefly hold on to ATP after releasing its energy , which did not happen with GTP in the modified protein . Updegrove , Harke et al . also discovered that the levels of GTP in a bacterial cell fall as it transforms into a spore , while ATP levels remain relatively high . This suggests that ATP may indeed have become the source of energy of choice because it was more available . These findings provide insights into how ATP became the energy currency in cells , and suggest that how ATP is bound by proteins can impact a protein’s activity . Additionally , these experiments could help inform the development of drugs targeting proteins that bind nucleotides: it may be essential to consider the entirety of the binding event , and not just the release of energy .
Leptin is a hormone that keeps us healthy in many ways . It regulates our body weight by reining in our appetite and fine-tuning the energy we burn , and it helps us establish and maintain our fertility . It also participates in brain development . Leptin performs these roles by attaching to specific receptors in nerve cells and relaying relevant information to the brain . Early events can trigger life-long changes in the way our body works , a process called metabolic programming . Leptin is believed to participate in this reprogramming mechanism , but its role remains uncertain . In particular , it is still unclear which leptin-driven changes are permanent , and which ones are reversible . Being able to distinguish between the two types of alterations would help to better grasp the role leptin plays in early development . Here , Ramos-Lobo et al . examined genetically engineered mice born without a working leptin receptor . These animals were impervious to the effects of leptin . Then , once the rodents were adults , they were treated with a drug that restored their leptin receptors , making them sensitive to the hormone again . These experiments revealed that mice without leptin receptors during early life developed obesity , were less able to lose weight and burned less energy . Their reproductive success was also compromised . Finally , the lack of leptin during development caused permanent reduction of the animals’ brains , and changes in the activity of certain genes in the organ . The work by Ramos-Lobo et al . indicates that in mice , lacking leptin sensibility early in life conditions the body to permanently become ‘thrifty’ , burning less energy and making it harder to lose weight . It is rare for humans to be born completely without leptin activity . Yet , having too much or too little food as a baby affects the level of the hormone , or our sensitivity to it: this may permanently change the way our bodies manage energy . Ultimately , learning more about these mechanisms could help us ward off or treat obesity .
Living cells need to be able to detect changes in their environment and respond accordingly . This ability involves signals from outside of the cell triggering changes to the activity inside the cell . Heterotrimeric G proteins are important for this kind of signaling in a wide range of organisms . In animals and fungi , these proteins directly work with a specific class of receptor proteins called G protein-coupled receptors ( or GPCRs for short ) . Plants also have heterotrimeric G proteins , but it remains unclear whether they similiarly work with GPCRs . Plants detect invading microbes by using receptors that are completely different from GPCRs . For example , a receptor called FLS2 from the model plant Arabidopsis senses a telltale protein produced by bacteria , and then passes the signal to another protein called BIK1 to activate the plant’s defenses . Heterotrimeric G proteins are required for this process , but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown . Liang , Ding et al . now show that heterotrimeric G proteins regulate FLS2-controlled defenses by directly interacting with FLS2 and BIK1 . Heterotrimeric G proteins also enhance defenses in at least two different ways . Firstly , in the absence of an infection , heterotrimeric G proteins stabilize the BIK1 protein to ensure that it is ready to respond . Secondly , if FLS2 does detect the telltale bacterial protein , BIK1 marks one of the heterotrimeric G proteins with a phosphate group . This then allows the G protein to boost the activity of another plant enzyme that is vital for defense signaling . In the future , it will be important to work out how activation of FLS2 leads to the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins . Furthermore , heterotrimeric G proteins are likely to regulate additional plant proteins when defenses are activated , and further studies are needed to identify these proteins .
The cycle of day and night sets the pace for the existence of most life on Earth . In response , many organisms have evolved internal biological clocks which are synchronized with the rhythm of light and dark . Thanks to this ‘circadian clock’ , plants and animals can predict the onset of dawn and dusk , and schedule biological processes to specific times of the day . Each cell possesses its own circadian clock , which is formed of a complex network of genes and proteins that get activated along a 24-hour cycle . This raises the question: how do these cells coordinate to create a body clock at the level of the entire organism ? In mammals , this synchronisation happens thanks to a structure in the brain , but much less is known about how this occurs in plants . This is partly because few studies exist that focus on measuring the clocks of individual plant cells . Here , Gould , Domijan et al . monitor the circadian clock of single cells in seedlings of a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana across several days and under constant environmental conditions . To do so , they use time-lapse microscopy and genetic methods to see when and where one of the clock’s core genes is switched on . The results show that , at the level of the plant , Arabidopsis has two waves of clock gene expression , one that goes up and one that goes down the root . In addition , the various parts of the plant have slightly different circadian rhythms – for instance , the tip of the root has a faster clock . Robust clock rhythms are also detected in individual cells across the plant . Clocks in neighbouring cells are found to communicate with each other to keep track of time , which might be contributing to this robustness . Mathematical simulations show that , when the individual clocks interact , they generate patterns of clock activity across the plant , which explains the two waves of gene expression in the root . Plant circadian rhythms control traits that are crucial for agriculture , such as growth , yield , disease resistance and flowering time . Understanding , and ultimately controlling , the intricate cogs of these clocks may one day allow scientists to create better performing crops .
Our ears were not designed for the society our brains created . The World Health Organization estimates that a billion young adults are at risk for hearing problems due to prolonged exposure to high levels of noise . For many people , the first symptoms of hearing loss consist in an inability to follow a single speaker in crowded places such as restaurants . However , when Parthasarathy et al . examined over 100 , 000 records from the Massachusetts Eye and Ear audiology database , they found that around 10% of patients who complained about hearing difficulties were sent home with a clean bill of hearing health . This is because existing tests do not detect common problems related to understanding speech in complex , real-world environments: new tests are needed to spot these hidden hearing disorders . Parthasarathy et al . therefore focused on identifying biological measures that would reflect these issues . Normally , the brain can ‘unmix’ different speakers and focus on one person , but even in the context of normal hearing , some people are better at this than others . Parthasarathy et al pinpointed several behavioral and biological markers which , when combined , could predict most of this variability . This involved , for example , measuring the diameter of the pupil while people are listening to speech in the presence of several distracting voices ( which mirrors how intensively they have to focus on the task ) or measuring the participants’ ability to detect subtle changes in frequency ( which reflects how fast-changing sound elements are encoded early on in the hearing system ) . The findings show that an over-reliance on high-level cognitive processes , such as increased listening effort , coupled with problems in the early processing of certain sound traits , was associated with problems in following a speaker in a busy environment . The biological and behavioral markers highlighted by Parthasarathy et al do not require specialized equipment or marathon sessions to be recorded . In theory , these tests could be implemented into most hospital hearing clinics to give patients and health providers objective data to understand , treat and monitor these hearing difficulties .
The magical twinkling of the night sky is actually the result of imperfections in Earth's atmosphere . Turbulence in the air distorts the light as it passes through , causing it to bend , which blurs the image . To get a clear picture of distant objects , astronomers use a technique called 'adaptive optics' . Deformable mirrors , controlled by computers , bend the light back to correct the distortion . Now , biologists are borrowing the same technique to take a closer look at the blood vessels of the brain . At the moment , functional MRI is one of the most popular imaging techniques for measuring blood flow in the brain . But it can only achieve a resolution of around 1 millimetre , and the tiniest capillaries measure less than a hundredth of a millimetre across . These tiny vessels can be examined surgically , or by injecting dyes into the bloodstream , but these techniques carry a risk . As a result , scientists can only use them in experimental animals . One solution is to look at the vessel network in the back of the eye . The retina is part of the brain and , because the eye is transparent , its blood supply is much easier to see . But imperfections in the eye bend light and blur images of the cells , just like the Earth's atmosphere blurs images of the stars . This is where adaptive optics comes in . Using this technique , it becomes possible to see single red blood cells . Combining adaptive optics with high-speed video could allow us to track cells through the whole network of blood vessels in the eye . At the moment , blood flow measurement techniques either focus on the very big vessels , or the very small ones; they cannot get a complete picture of the whole interconnected system . Now , Joseph et al . have combined adaptive optics , ultrafast imaging , and a new algorithm to view the whole blood vessel network in the eye of a mouse . The new method can automatically measure single blood cells , even when they are moving at their highest possible speed . It can capture the full range of retinal vessels , from the smallest capillaries to the largest arteries and veins . And , by tracking millions of cells at a time , it can reveal how the pressure wave of the blood changes with each beat of the heart . The slightest disruption in blood flow to the brain can cause irreversible damage . So , measuring blood flow is crucial to understanding what happens when things go wrong . This new method is not invasive and uses safe levels of near-infrared light which the retina cannot see , making it safe to use in humans . Joseph et al . have already started their first studies in humans , and the baseline data they have obtained for healthy mice also provides a starting point for comparison with mice with genetic mutations or disease .
Like all plants , crop plants need nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate to grow . Often these essential elements are in short supply , and so millions of tons of fertiliser are applied to agricultural land each year to maintain crop yields . Another way for plants to gain access to scarce nutrients is to form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms that live in the soil . Plants pass on carbon-containing compounds—such as sugars—to the microbes and , in return , certain fungi provide minerals—such as phosphates—to the plants . Some plants called legumes ( such as peas , beans , and clovers ) can also form relationships with bacteria that convert nitrogen from the air into ammonia , which the plants then use to make molecules such as DNA and proteins . To establish these symbiotic relationships with plants , nitrogen-fixing bacteria release chemical signals that are recognized via receptor proteins , called NFR1 and NFR5 , found on the surface of the plant root cells . These signals trigger a cascade of events that ultimately lead to the plant forming an organ called ‘root nodule’ to house and nourish the nitrogen-fixing bacteria . A similar signalling mechanism is thought to take place during the establishment of symbiotic relationships between plants and certain soil fungi . A plant protein called Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( or SYMRK for short ) that is also located on the root cell surface is required for both bacteria–plant and fungi–plant associations to occur . However , the exact role of this protein in these processes was unclear . Ried et al . have now investigated this by taking advantage of a property of cell surface receptor proteins: if some of these proteins are made in excessive amounts they activate their signalling cascades even when the initial signal is not present . Ried et al . engineered plants called Lotus japonicus to produce high levels of SYMRK , NFR1 , or NFR5 . Each of these changes was sufficient to trigger the plants to develop root nodules in the absence of microbes . Genes associated with the activation of the signalling cascade involved the formation of root nodules were also switched on when each of the three proteins was produced in large amounts . In contrast , only an excess of SYMRK could activate genes related to fungi–plant associations . Ried et al . also found that , while SYMRK can function in the absence of the NFRs , NFR1 and NFR5 need each other to function . These data suggest that the receptor proteins play a key role in the decision between the establishment of an association with a bacterium or a fungus . As an excess of symbiotic receptors caused plants to form symbiotic structures , Ried et al . propose that this strategy could be used to persuade plants that usually do not form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to do so . If this is possible , it might lead us to engineer crop plants to form symbiotic interactions with nitrogen-fixing bacteria; this would help increase crop yields and enable crops to be grown in nitrogen-poor environments without the addition of extra fertiliser .
Studying animal behavior can reveal how animals make decisions based on what they sense in their environment , but measuring behavior can be difficult and time-consuming . Computer programs that measure and analyze animal movement have made these studies faster and easier to complete . These tools have also made more advanced behavioral experiments possible , which have yielded new insights about how the brain organizes behavior . Recently , scientists have started using new machine learning tools called deep neural networks to measure animal behavior . These tools learn to measure animal posture – the positions of an animal’s body parts in space – directly from real data , such as images or videos , without being explicitly programmed with instructions to perform the task . This allows deep learning algorithms to automatically track the locations of specific animal body parts in videos faster and more accurately than previous techniques . This ability to learn from images also removes the need to attach physical markers to animals , which may alter their natural behavior . Now , Graving et al . have created a new deep learning toolkit for measuring animal behavior that combines components from previous tools with the latest advances in computer science . Simple modifications to how the algorithms are trained can greatly improve their performance . For example , adding connections between layers , or ‘neurons’ , in the deep neural network and training the algorithm to learn the full geometry of the body – by drawing lines between body parts – both enhance its accuracy . As a result of adding these changes , the new toolkit can measure an animal's pose from previously unseen images with high speed and accuracy , after being trained on just 100 examples . Graving et al . tested their model on videos of fruit flies , zebras and locusts , and found that , after training , it was able to accurately track the animals’ movements . The new toolkit has an easy-to-use software interface and is freely available for other scientists to use and build on . The new toolkit may help scientists in many fields including neuroscience and psychology , as well as other computer scientists . For example , companies like Google and Apple use similar algorithms to recognize gestures , so making those algorithms faster and more efficient may make them more suitable for mobile devices like smartphones or virtual-reality headsets . Other possible applications include diagnosing and tracking injuries , or movement-related diseases in humans and livestock .
Cells of the innate immune system , such as macrophages , are the body’s first line of defense against infection . Macrophages can sense a wide variety of danger signals associated with the presence of infectious microbes , and some of these signals cause macrophages to form protein complexes called inflammasomes inside the cell . Inflammasomes produce molecules that stimulate inflammation and trigger the death of the macrophage . This attracts other immune cells to the infection site to help combat the source of danger . Inflammasome complexes form around an activated receptor molecule called NLRP3 . NLRP3 is activated by a range of danger signals , including those produced by Salmonella bacteria . However , the sequence of events that leads to NLRP3 activation is still not well understood . Sanman et al . have now identified a small molecule that unexpectedly causes the formation of inflammasomes via NLRP3 and so triggers the death of macrophages . Further investigation revealed that this molecule disrupts glycolysis , a process macrophages use to produce energy . The energy imbalance caused by disrupting glycolysis triggers a stress response in macrophages , which ultimately activates the NLRP3 receptor and hence the inflammasome . Sanman et al . then found that Salmonella bacteria also activate the inflammasome by disrupting glycolysis when they invade macrophages . This occurs because the bacteria use up the macrophage’s supply of glycolysis precursor molecules . Replenishing the macrophage with products of glycolysis restored partial energy production and prevented the inflammasome from being activated . Overall , Sanman et al . have identified a previously unknown trigger of inflammation and cell death in macrophages whereby cells can respond to infectious bacteria by sensing a change in energy levels . A next step will be to define the signaling molecules that activate NLRP3 to trigger the construction of the inflammasome . Sanman et al . also hope to uncover other infections and diseases where changes in energy balance might trigger inflammation and cell death .
DNA in a cell is under constant stress from environmental factors , such as ultraviolet light , or from damage caused by the replication process . These sources of stress can cause breaks in the genome , which if left unrepaired can lead to cancer or cell death . One of the most accurate ways to repair a broken fragment of DNA is through recombination – whereby an undamaged copy of the sequence is located in another DNA molecule and used as a template to replace the missing fragment . DNA recombination is regulated by more than a dozen proteins that help recruit the enzyme RAD51 to sites of DNA damage , and trigger its search for complementary sequences of DNA . A molecule known as PALB2 binds to these DNA repair proteins and coordinates their activity . If PALB2 , or these other proteins become mutated , this can increase the risk cancerous growths in various tissues , including the breasts and ovaries . Having a better understanding of how this group of proteins control the repair process could therefore improve prognosis and advance cancer treatments . Now , Deveryshetty et al . have discovered a new and unexpected role for PALB2 within the recombination pathway . As well as binding to other repair proteins , PALB2 interacts directly with DNA , and this interaction was found to be an important part of the repair process . Even in the absence of RAD51 , PALB2 was still able to recombine short fragments of DNA sequence . PALB2 achieves this by initiating recombination using single strands of DNA or a DNA-like molecule known as RNA . This latter property may be particularly important if the molecular machines needed to replicate DNA and synthesize RNA collide on the same DNA molecule . This new role for PALB2 could lead to the discovery of other DNA repair mechanisms , and could be used to predict which PALB2 mutations are more likely to cause cancer . Patients who are at greater risk of cancer could then be treated with more advanced therapies , in order to increase their chances of recovery .
Bacterial cells come in a variety of different shapes , including spheres , rods , spirals , and crescents . Shape is important for bacterial cells because it plays a role in cell division , helps to maximize the uptake of nutrients , and aids cell movement . The shape of a cell is determined mainly by its cytoskeleton , a form of ‘scaffolding’ within the cell that is made of various protein filaments . The bacterial cytoskeleton was discovered over 20 years ago , but it has not been studied as much as the cytoskeletons of yeast , plant , animals , and other eukaryotes . Many of the bacterial proteins and filaments that make up the cytoskeleton are similar to those found in eukaryotes . A protein called MreB , for example , is the bacterial equivalent of actin , which performs a wide range of roles in eukaryotes . However , van den Ent , Izoré et al . have now shown that the detailed structure of MreB filaments is different to that of actin filaments . It has been known for some time that actin filaments are composed of two strands of actin proteins that are twisted and parallel with each other . MreB filaments are also made of two strands of MreB proteins , but van den Ent , Izoré et al . found that these strands are straight , not twisted , and that they are antiparallel rather than parallel . Thus , unlike other filaments of actin-like proteins , where the two ends of the filament are clearly different from each other , the antiparallel strands of MreB form a double filament without a clear direction . van den Ent , Izoré et al . also showed that MreB double filaments can bind to surfaces that mimic a bacterial cell membrane , and that mutant bacterial cells without these double filaments adopt the wrong cell shape . Further experiments exposed potential targets on the MreB filaments for antibiotics that could treat bacterial infections .
Many plants produce flowers that attract insects to land on them . Different insects are attracted to flowers of different shapes and colors . Therefore , it is generally advantageous for plants of the same species to produce flowers that look very similar . For example , a small weed known as Arabidopsis – which is often used in research studies – produces little white flowers that all have four petals . Thus , the number of petals in Arabidopsis flowers is said to be a ‘robust’ trait . However , a closely-related plant called hairy bittercress produces flowers with any number of petals between zero and four . Studying the genetic differences between Arabidopsis and hairy bittercress can help to reveal why the numbers of petals on hairy bittercress flowers vary . A gene called APETALA1 helps to control how petals form . Monniaux , Pieper et al . found that Arabidopsis and hairy bittercress have different versions of this gene that determine whether the number of petals may vary between individual flowers . Inserting the Arabidopsis version of APETALA1 into hairy bittercress plants caused the plants to produce flowers that had more similar numbers of petals to each other , that is , the petal number became more robust . Monniaux , Pieper et al . then used a statistical method called quantitative trait locus analysis to identify the precise location of regions in the hairy bittercress genome that control petal number . This showed that the Arabidopsis version of APETALA1 , but not the hairy bittercress version , conceals the action of these genes that could alter petal number . These findings reveal that evolutionary change in a single gene of hairy bittercress unmasked the action of other genes that caused petal number to vary . A next step will be to identify some of these genes and understand how they control petal number .
Our body fine-tunes the amount of sugar in our blood thanks to specialized ‘beta cells’ in the pancreas , which can release a hormone called insulin . To produce insulin , the beta cells first need to build an early version of the molecule – known as proinsulin – inside a cellular compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum . This process involves the formation of internal staples that keep the molecule of proinsulin folded correctly . Individuals developing type 2 diabetes have spikes of sugar in their blood , and so their bodies often respond by trying to make large amounts of insulin . After a while , the beta cells can fail to keep up , which brings on the full-blown disease . However , scientists have discovered that early in type 2 diabetes , the endoplasmic reticulum of beta cells can already show signs of stress; yet , the exact causes of this early damage are still unknown . To investigate this , Arunagiri et al . looked into whether proinsulin folds correctly during the earliest stages of type 2 diabetes . Biochemical experiments showed that even healthy beta cells contained some misfolded proinsulin molecules , where the molecular staples that should fold proinsulin internally were instead abnormally linking proinsulin molecules together . Further work revealed that the misfolded proinsulin was accumulating inside the endoplasmic reticulum . Finally , obese mice that were in the earliest stages of type 2 diabetes had the highest levels of abnormal proinsulin in their beta cells . Overall , the work by Arunagiri et al . suggests that large amounts of proinsulin molecules stapling themselves to each other in the endoplasmic reticulum of beta cells could be an early hallmark of the disease , and could make it get worse . A separate study by Jang et al . also shows that a protein that limits the misfolding of proinsulin is key to maintain successful insulin production in animals eating a Western-style , high fat diet . Hundreds of millions of people around the world have type 2 diabetes , and this number is rising quickly . Detecting and then fixing early problems associated with the condition may help to stop the disease in its track .
Plants , animals and fungi store much of their DNA tightly packed with proteins in a form named heterochromatin . This arrangement helps to inactivate genes that are not needed in specific cells or at specific times , and provides a way to protect the genetic material from damage . Heterochromatin tends to form when an enzyme called a lysine methyltransferase chemically modifies some of the proteins associated with the DNA , which are known as histones . This enzyme modifies only some of the histones to get the process started , while a second protein then binds to the modified histones and causes more of the DNA to become packaged up as heterochromatin . In 2012 , researchers reported that the version of the lysine methyltransferase enzyme from yeast binds to RNA molecules via a portion known as its chromodomain . Moreover , the enzyme needed to bind to RNA to help heterochromatin to form . A similar mechanism also occurs in fruit flies , another organism that is commonly studied in the laboratory . However , it was not clear if it happened in mammals like mice and humans . Now , Shirai , Kawaguchi et al . – who include many of the researchers involved in the 2012 study – report that the corresponding enzyme from mice can also bind to RNA molecules via its chromodomain . Further experiments showed that this activity was closely linked with the enzyme’s ability to target the correct histones and efficiently form heterochromatin . The first experiments were conducted using purified enzymes in the laboratory , while follow-up experiments looked at the enzyme’s activity within mouse cells . Other studies have previously reported that mutant mice lacking the lysine methyltransferase enzyme have defective heterochromatin , tend to die young and have genetic instabilities that are associated with an increased risk of tumors and male infertility . The new findings of Shirai , Kawaguchi et al . reveal that the mechanism behind the establishment of heterochromatin has mostly likely been conserved over a billion years of evolution , which is when yeast and mammals last shared a common ancestor . By revealing more about how mammalian cells can protect their DNA , these new findings could also mark an important step toward understanding and preventing birth defects that are caused when an embryo’s genetic material becomes damaged .
When driving home from work , we can easily tell where we are along our route . A network of regions deep within the brain acts a little like an inbuilt GPS and tracks our position relative to other objects in the environment . Cells in one of these brain regions , called the entorhinal cortex , construct a map of our surroundings . The map resembles a grid of tessellating triangles , and the cells that produce it are called grid cells . Whenever we move onto a corner of one of the triangles , the corresponding grid cells start to fire . This firing enables the brain to track our movements . But grid cells may do more than support navigation through the physical world . They may also help us navigate through our memories . Evidence suggests that we organize our knowledge and experiences into mental maps . These maps connect related concepts just as physical maps connect nearby locations . In principle , the brain systems that support physical navigation may also enable us to access the information within our mental maps . But for this to be true , cells such as grid cells must respond to movement in mental space as well as in physical space . Wilming et al . have now tested this possibility by training macaque monkeys to detect a color change in a dot moving across a screen . The monkeys had to keep their eyes fixed on the center of the screen throughout the task . This meant they could not move their eyes to track the dot . Instead they had to mentally move the focus of their attention . Wilming et al . monitored the activity of cells in the entorhinal cortex as the monkeys mentally followed the dot . As predicted , some of the cells fired in a triangular grid-like pattern similar to that seen when animals move through their environment . Grid cells can thus fire in the absence of physical movement . These findings bring us closer to understanding how brain circuits that code for spatial locations also support other mental processes . Evidence from many sources suggests that structures within the brain’s medial temporal lobe , including the entorhinal cortex , contribute to memory . The next challenge is to identify how these brain regions encode spatial and other types of information and use them to form memories .
In science , it is of vital importance that multiple studies corroborate the same result . Researchers therefore need to know all the details of previous experiments in order to implement the procedures as exactly as possible . However , this is becoming a major problem in neuroscience , as animal studies of behavior have proven to be hard to reproduce , and most experiments are never replicated by other laboratories . Mice are increasingly being used to study the neural mechanisms of decision making , taking advantage of the genetic , imaging and physiological tools that are available for mouse brains . Yet , the lack of standardized behavioral assays is leading to inconsistent results between laboratories . This makes it challenging to carry out large-scale collaborations which have led to massive breakthroughs in other fields such as physics and genetics . To help make these studies more reproducible , the International Brain Laboratory ( a collaborative research group ) et al . developed a standardized approach for investigating decision making in mice that incorporates every step of the process; from the training protocol to the software used to analyze the data . In the experiment , mice were shown images with different contrast and had to indicate , using a steering wheel , whether it appeared on their right or left . The mice then received a drop of sugar water for every correction decision . When the image contrast was high , mice could rely on their vision . However , when the image contrast was very low or zero , they needed to consider the information of previous trials and choose the side that had recently appeared more frequently . This method was used to train 140 mice in seven laboratories from three different countries . The results showed that learning speed was different across mice and laboratories , but once training was complete the mice behaved consistently , relying on visual stimuli or experiences to guide their choices in a similar way . These results show that complex behaviors in mice can be reproduced across multiple laboratories , providing an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision making . This work could serve as a foundation for other groups , paving the way to a more collaborative approach in the field of neuroscience that could help to tackle complex research challenges .
The human body has a limited ability to regenerate and repair itself after major injuries . By contrast , flatworms – most notably planarians such as Schmidtea mediterranea – have exceptional regenerative abilities and can regrow large parts of their bodies . Regrowing body parts is a complex process involving the coordinated creation of many different types of cells , and thus an important first step in understanding tissue regeneration is to develop a detailed catalog of cell types in that tissue . Laser capture microdissection , or LCM for short , is a technology used to isolate and study subregions or even individual cells from within a tissue . This approach can help to identify different cell types and to examine what makes them unique . LCM can be used to create a detailed catalog of cells , their differences and the roles they perform . Forsthoefel et al . have now used LCM to study cells from the planarian digestive system . This approach found 1 , 800 genes that have high activity in cells from the gut and showed many similarities between planaria and humans . LCM made it possible to study these cells in a new level of detail , revealing several hundred new genes as well as new cell types . The study showed that regeneration and survival of cells known as goblet cells particularly depended on two genes , gli-1 and RREB2 . Irreversible gut damage in humans can result from surgeries and conditions such as acid reflux . Other animals are able to repair and regenerate the gut more successfully . Techniques like LCM can help researchers to understand the differences between humans and other species . In time , these insights may lead to technologies and therapies that can improve our own abilities to heal following injuries .
The mormyrids are a family of fish that can generate and detect weak electric fields that they use to navigate and communicate . Each species in this family produces its own distinct shape of electrical signals . Other fish detect these signals using structures called receptors , which then send information to the brain in the form of an electrical nerve impulse . Previous research showed that different species of fish respond to different aspects of the electric fields they detect , depending on the receptor types that they have evolved . For example , some species have ‘spiking receptors’ that send a spike of activity to the brain at the start or end of a detected electrical pulse . This allows the fish to detect subtle changes to the shape of the detected electric field . Other species have sensors known as oscillatory receptors; these send a continuous wave of nerve activity to the brain even when no electric field is detected . It is not clear exactly how oscillatory receptors work or what the roles of these different receptor types are . Baker et al . have now recorded the activity of the receptors of mormyrid fish as they were exposed to electrical fields that mimic the signals they are normally exposed to in their daily environment . The recordings confirmed previous results that suggest that species with spiking receptors are able to detect variations in the shapes of electrical signals produced by other fish because the receptors produce spikes of activity at the start or end of a detected signal . This response pattern allows their brains to analyze the signal shape . In contrast , Baker et al . found that when oscillatory receptors detect a new electric field , they reset their pattern of nerve activity , causing multiple receptors to briefly synchronize their activity . This enables the fish to detect where a signal has been sent from . However , the oscillatory receptors are unable to detect any variations in the shape of the detected electric signal . The oscillatory receptors are most sensitive to certain electric field patterns that are produced by large groups of a single species of fish . Further experiments showed that the fish also change their behavior when these particular electric field patterns are detected . Why some species of mormyrids have spiking receptors while others have oscillatory receptors is unknown . It is also unknown how the brain processes oscillatory receptor activity . Future studies will investigate whether these two receptor types may be linked to differences in fish's social behavior , and how the neural networks for processing sensory information differ between the two types of fishes .
Whooping cough is a respiratory illness caused by bacteria in the Bordetella genus . Among the general public , Bordetella species have become a hot topic in recent years due to the re-emergence of whooping cough in the United States and elsewhere . Scientists , meanwhile have become interested in a virus called BPP-1 that can kill the Bordetella species . BPP-1 is a double-stranded DNA virus , and such viruses have long been of interest to scientists because they are the most abundant organisms on Earth . These viruses are also noteworthy because their shells ( also known as capsids ) are capable of withstanding the very high pressures ( up to about 40 atmospheres ) that are created by packing so much DNA into the very small volume inside the capsid . BPP-1 is of particular interest because it is capable of making large-scale changes to its own DNA in order to adapt to changes in its hosts and environment . Of all the organism that do not contain nuclei within their cells ( collectively known as prokaryotes ) , BPP-1 is the only one that is capable of making such changes to its DNA . However , efforts to exploit the properties of BPP-1 for bioengineering applications have been hampered because its detailed structure is not known . Now Zhang et al . have used cryo electron microscopy to study the structure of BPP-1 at the atomic level . Most viruses belong to one of three major lineages , with each lineage having a characteristic fold in its capsid proteins . Zhang et al . found that BPP-1 contains two of these folds , which suggests that it is a hybrid of two of these lineages . This is the first time that such a structure has been observed . Moreover , Zhang et al . found that one of the folds has an unusual topology that has not been seen before . The atomic structure reveals how double-stranded DNA viruses use a variety of non-covalent interactions and a type of protein ‘chainmail’ to form a highly stable capsid that is capable of withstanding very high pressures . In addition to enabling applications in bioengineering , the new structure might also provide insights into the evolution of prokaryotes .
Viruses are constantly evolving as a result of mutations in their genetic material and environmental pressures . Viruses switching between insects and mammals face unique evolutionary pressures because they must retain their ability to infect both types of organisms . Yet , the mutations in a virus that may be beneficial in an insect may be different from the ones that may be beneficial in a mammal . Mutations in one host may be even harmful in the other . To learn more about how such viruses thrive as they switch between hosts , Dolan , Taguwa et al . studied the dengue virus , which causes over 390 million infections and over 10 , 000 deaths each year around the globe . They compared the mutations that occurred as the virus multiplied in human and mosquito cells grown in a laboratory . In the experiments , they used a method called ultra-deep RNA sequencing to identify every change that occurred in the genetic material of the virus each time it multiplied . They determined whether the mutations were beneficial or harmful based on whether they became more common – suggesting they helped the virus survive – or whether they did not persist because they were likely harmful or even fatal to the virus . The experiments showed that many harmful mutations constantly occur in the virus , in both human and mosquito cells . Beneficial changes happen rarely , and those that do are usually only helpful in one type of cell . Fatal mutations tended to occur in parts of the genetic material that encodes regions in the viral proteins that must remain the same . These structural elements appear to be essential to the virus’s survival and unable to undergo change , which makes them good targets for antiviral drugs or vaccines . The techniques used in the study may be useful for investigating other viruses and for understanding the evolutionary constraints on viruses more generally . This may help scientists develop antiviral drugs or vaccines that will remain effective even as viruses continue to evolve and mutate .
The Ras family of proteins play an important role in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of the cell . Ras proteins are attached by a fatty tail to the inner surface of the cell membrane . When activated they transmit a burst of signal that controls critical behaviors like growth , survival and movement . It has been suggested that to prevent these signals from being accidently activated , Ras molecules must group together at specialized sites within the membrane before passing on their message . However , visualizing how Ras molecules cluster together at these domains has thus far been challenging . As a result , little is known about where these sites are located and how Ras molecules come to a stop at these domains . Now , Lee et al . have combined two microscopy techniques called ‘single-particle tracking’ and ‘photoactivated localization microscopy' to track how individual molecules of activated Ras move in human cells grown in the lab . This revealed that Ras molecules quickly diffuse along the inside of the membrane until they arrive at certain locations that cause them to halt . However , computer models consisting of just the ‘fast’ and ‘immobile’ state could not correctly re-capture the way Ras molecules moved along the membrane . Lee et al . found that for these models to mimic the movement of Ras , a third ‘intermediate’ state of Ras mobility needed to be included . To investigate this further , Lee et al . created a fluorescent map that overlaid all the individual paths taken by each Ras molecule . The map showed regions in the membrane where the Ras molecules had stopped and possibly clustered together . Each of these ‘immobilization domains’ were then surrounded by an ‘intermediate domain’ where Ras molecules had begun to slow down their movement . Although the intermediate domains did not last long , they seemed to guide Ras molecules into the immobilization domains where they could cluster together with other molecules . From there , the cell constantly removed Ras molecules from these membrane domains and returned them back to their ‘fast’ diffusing state . Mutations in Ras proteins occur in around a third of all cancers , so a better understanding of their dynamics could help with future drug discovery . The methods used here could also be used to investigate the movement of other signaling molecules .
Before an animal is born , a protein called BMP plays a key role in establishing the difference between the front and the back of the animal . Cells nearer the front of the embryo contain higher amounts of the BMP protein , whilst cells nearer the back have progressively lower levels of BMP . This gradient of BMP ‘concentration’ affects the identity of the cells , with the level of BMP in each cell dictating what parts of the body are made where . The prevailing view among scientists is that the BMP gradient is created by an opposing gradient of another protein called Chordin , which is found at high levels at the back of the embryo and lower levels near the front . Chordin inhibits BMP and the interaction between the two proteins establishes the gradients that create order across the embryo . Zinski et al . used computer models to investigate how the BMP gradient is created . Several possibilities were considered , including the effect of Chordin . Comparing the models to precise experimental measurements of BMP activity in zebrafish embryos suggested that a different mechanism known as a source-sink model , rather than the opposing Chordin gradient , may be responsible for the pattern of BMP found in the embryo . In this model , the BMP is produced at the front of the embryo and moves towards the back end by diffusion . At the back of the embryo , BMP is mopped up by Chordin , resulting in a constant gradient of BMP along the embryo . Many other processes that control how animals grow and develop rely on the formation of similar protein gradients , so these findings may also apply to other aspects of animal development . Understanding how animals grow and develop may help researchers to develop strategies to regrow tissues and organs in human patients .
Lysosomes are specialized , enclosed compartments within cells with harsh chemical conditions where enzymes break down large molecules into smaller component parts . The products of these reactions are then transported out of the lysosome by transporter proteins so that they can be used to build new molecules that the cell needs . Despite their importance , only a few lysosomal transporters have been thoroughly studied . A protein called MFSD1 had previously been identified as a potential lysosomal transporter , but its precise role has not been described . Now , Massa López et al . have characterized the role of MFSD1 , by genetically modifying mice so they could no longer make the transporter . These mice developed severe liver damage . In particular , a specific type of cell that is important for lining blood vessels in the liver , seemed to be lost in these mice . Older MFSD1 deficient mice also had more tumors in their livers compared to normal mice . Massa López et al . next examined what happened to other lysosomal proteins in the MFSD1 deficient mice , and found that these mice had strikingly low levels of a protein called GLMP . To better understand the relationship between GLMP and MFSD1 , another strain of genetically modified mice was analyzed , this time missing GLMP . Mice without GLMP were found to have very similar liver problems to those observed in the mice lacking MFSD1 . Moreover , the GLMP deficient mice had low levels of the MFSD1 protein . Further experiments demonstrated that MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact with each other: GLMP seemed to protect MFSD1 from being degraded in the harsh internal environment of the lysosome . Thus both GLMP and MFSD1 were needed to form a stable lysosomal transporter . Characterizing MFSD1 is important for scientists attempting to understand how the lysosomal membrane and transporters work . Moreover , these findings may shed light on how defects in lysosomal transporters contribute to metabolic disease .
The inside of a cell is a dynamic environment . Large molecules such as proteins are commonly transported within a cell by ‘motor proteins’ , which move along a network of filaments called microtubules . One group of motor proteins , the kinesins , typically have one end called a motor domain that attaches itself to a microtubule . The other end links to the cargo being carried , and a flexible ‘neck’ region connects the two ends of the motor protein . Kinesins are bound together in pairs . The flexible neck region allows each motor domain in a pair to move past that of the other , allowing the kinesin to ‘walk’ along a microtubule in a step-like manner . Each step requires one motor domain to alternately tightly associate with , and then release from , a microtubule filament . This alternating cycle is coordinated by kinesin binding to and breaking down a molecule called ATP to form another molecule called ADP , which releases the energy needed for its next step . This repeating cycle is possible because a motor domain changes shape when it binds to a microtubule . This shape change stimulates the release of ADP , freeing up room for a new ATP molecule to bind to the motor domain . Although relatively small , these structural changes produce larger changes in the flexible neck region that enable the individual motor domains within a kinesin pair to co-ordinate their movement and move efficiently . Many previous studies have investigated these shape changes using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy , which rapidly freezes samples and allows their structure to be recorded in high detail . However , the small size of the motor domains and their changes in shape means that this technique was not able to reveal the structures in full detail . Shang et al . now exploit recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy to examine the structural changes of individual kinesin motor domains in greater detail . Images of motor domains bound to microtubules were made while the motor domain was in one of two different states: not bound to ATP or ADP , or bound to a chemically modified form of ATP that cannot be broken down . Shang et al . then used these images to produce models of the motor domains and compared the models with previously published images . This revealed a cleft in the kinesin motor domain that opens when it attaches to a microtubule . This cleft's ‘clamshell-like’ opening allows ADP to be released; it then closes when a molecule of ATP binds to it . The opening and closing of the cleft causes the changes in the ‘neck linker’ of the kinesin that enable the motor protein to transport its cargo , and so links ATP binding to the movement of the motor protein . Shang et al . suggest that similar processes may also occur in other motor proteins that have not been as well studied as the kinesins .
Proteins are molecules that need to fold into the right shape to do their job . If proteins lose that shape , not only do they stop working but they risk clumping together and becoming toxic , potentially leading to disease . Fortunately , the cell has quality control systems that normally detect and remove misfolded proteins before they can cause damage to the cell . First , sets of proteins known as chaperones recognize the misfolded proteins , and then another class of proteins attaches a molecular tag , known as ubiquitin , to the misshapen proteins . When several ubiquitin tags are attached to a protein , forming chains of ubiquitin , it is transported to a large molecular machine within the cell called the proteasome . The proteasome unravels the protein and breaks it down into its constituent building blocks , which can then be used to create new proteins . Proteins are found throughout the different compartments of the cell and quality control processes have been well-studied in some parts of the cell but not others . Metzger et al . have now revealed how the process works on the surface of mitochondria , the compartment that provides the cell with most of its energy . To do this , they used baker’s yeast , a model laboratory organism that shares many fundamental properties with animal cells , but which is easier to manipulate genetically . The quality control process was studied using two mitochondrial proteins that had been mutated to make them sensitive to changes in temperature . This meant that , when the temperature increased from 25°C to 37°C , these proteins would begin to unravel and trigger the clean-up operation . This approach has been used previously to understand the quality control processes in other parts of the cell . By removing different quality control machinery in turn from the yeast cells , Metzger et al . could detect which were necessary for the process on mitochondria . This showed that there were many similarities with how this process happen in other parts of the cell but that the precise combination of chaperones and enzymes involved was distinct . Furthermore , when the proteasome was not working , the misfolded proteins remained on the mitochondria , showing that they are not transported to other parts of the cell to be broken down . In the future , understanding this process could help to find potential drug targets for mitochondrial diseases . The next steps will be to see how well these findings apply to human and other mammalian cells .
Our skin is our largest organ; it provides a barrier that protects the underlying tissues and internal organs from the external environment and acts as one of our first lines of defense against infection . Both of these roles subject the skin to wear and tear and so it must constantly create new skin cells to replace those lost or damaged . However , if this renewal process goes awry it can lead to excessive cell growth or skin cancer . To avoid this , cells tightly regulate the pathways that stimulate skin renewal . Skin renewal involves growth signals activating an enzyme called ERK . When and where the ERK enzyme is activated is normally tightly regulated , and many kinds of cancer have been linked to ERK becoming active at the wrong time or in the wrong place . Despite the importance of ERK in skin cells , a number of technical challenges have made it difficult to study how these signals are passed from cell to cell . Hiratsuka et al . have now examined genetically altered mice that produce a fluorescent sensor molecule that makes it possible to see ERK activity in living skin cells . The skin of anesthetized mice was observed under a microscope , and time-lapse videos revealed occasional ‘firework-like’ bursts of ERK activity . At first the ERK enzyme was active in a small cluster of skin cells , then ERK activity was seen in the surrounding cells—appearing to spread outwards over the course of several minutes—before the activity stopped . Hiratsuka et al . named this pattern of activity a ‘Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution’ , or SPREAD for short . By studying SPREADs in the skin on the ears and the back of these mice , Hiratsuka et al . learned that these bursts of ERK activity coincided with skin cell growth; the bursts happened more frequently in the areas where the skin cells were dividing . Applying a chemical that stimulates cell division to the skin of the mice triggered more bursts of ERK activity; whereas fewer bursts were observed if Hiratsuka et al . used other chemicals to block the activity of some of the signaling proteins that work upstream of ERK . Further experiments suggested that SPREADs encourage cells to progress through the cycle of events that leads a cell to divide; blocking these bursts caused the cell to pause at the stage just before it would normally divide . Hiratsuka et al . also observed similar patterns of ERK activity moving out like waves from the edges of skin wounds . Further research using similar methods will reveal how growth signals are triggered and propagated in healthy and diseased tissues , not only in the skin but also other organs such as the liver , intestine , and muscles .
All life forms on the surface of our planet face an environment that cycles between day and night as the Earth rotates around its axis . To deal with these regular changes , organisms from bacteria to humans have internal rhythms , called circadian clocks , that coordinate different aspects of these organisms’ lives , from growth to the urge to sleep , with the day-night cycle . The simplest of all known circadian clocks is found in bacteria called cyanobacteria , which live in bodies of water all around the world . Like plants , these microorganisms can harness the energy in sunlight to fuel their growth . The internal clock of cyanobacteria is remarkable because it can be rebuilt in the laboratory using just three components , proteins called KaiA , KaiB and KaiC . When mixed together in a test tube , these proteins spontaneously generate a 24-hour cycle in which KaiC gets chemically modified by the addition and removal of a phosphate group . These chemical modifications on KaiC are like the hands of the clock that tell the time of day . Much work on the internal clock of cyanobacteria has focused on how the clock proteins generate rhythms . What has been less clear is how this rhythm works in an environment that changes between day and night and from season to season . For example , away from the equator , the length of the day changes throughout the year . Changes in day length are important for cyanobacteria because they can grow only during the day and must rest at night . Yet , it was not understood how this microorganism's clock adjusts to days of different length . To address this question , Leypunskiy et al . made a device to grow cyanobacteria in many different light-dark cycles while monitoring their circadian rhythm . The experiments revealed a fairly simple result: the internal clock time is always the same at the middle of the day , regardless of how long the day is . Next , Leypunskiy et al . developed a way to study how the clock proteins in the test tube respond to chemical signals mimicking day and night . Unexpectedly , this showed that the Kai proteins themselves have the ability to track the middle of the day . It turns out that these proteins are not only able to generate a 24-hour rhythm , but also to correctly align it to the day-night cycle . Together , these findings will guide other researchers to better understand the molecular origins of how circadian clocks align to the day-night cycle . Moreover , by showing that the effects of a light-dark cycle on a circadian clock can be mimicked in a test tube , these results open the doors to using the tools of biochemistry to understand how circadian clocks work in natural environments .
Nerve cells called sympathetic neurons can control the activity of almost all of our organs without any conscious thought on our part . For example , these nerve cells are responsible for accelerating the heart rate during exercise . In a developing embryo , there are initially more of these neurons than are needed , and only those that develop correctly and form a connection with a target cell will survive . This is because the target cells provide the growing neurons with vital molecules called neurotrophins , which are trafficked back along the nerve fiber and into the main body of the nerve cell to ensure its survival . However , it is largely unknown which proteins or genes are also involved in this developmental process . Now , Bouilloux , Thireau et al . show that if a gene called Meis1 is inactivated in mice , the sympathetic neurons start to develop and grow nerve fibers , but then fail to establish connections with their target cells and finally die . The Meis1 gene encodes a transcription factor , which is a protein that regulates gene activity . Therefore , Bouilloux , Thireau et al . looked for the genes that are regulated by this transcription factor in sympathetic neurons . This search uncovered several genes that are involved in the packaging and trafficking of molecules within cells . Other experiments then revealed that the trafficking of molecules back along the nerve fiber was altered in mutant neurons in which the Meis1 gene had been inactivated . Furthermore , Meis1 mutant mice had problems with their heart rate , especially during exercise , and an increased risk of dying from a sudden cardiac arrest . These findings reveal a transcription factor that helps to establish a connection between a neuron and its target , and that activates a pattern of gene expression that works alongside the neurotrophin-based signals . Since all neurons undergo similar processes during development , future work could ask if comparable patterns of gene expression exist in other types of neurons , and if problems with such processes contribute to some neurodegenerative diseases .
Engineers have long studied how mechanical instabilities cause patterns to form in inanimate materials , and recently more attention has been given to how such forces affect biological systems . For example , stresses can build up within a tissue if one layer grows faster than an adjacent layer . The tissue can release this stress by wrinkling , folding or creasing . Though ancient and single-celled , bacteria can also develop spectacular patterns when they exist in the lifestyle known as a biofilm: a community of cells adhered to a surface . But do mechanical instabilities drive the patterns seen in biofilms ? To investigate , Yan , Fei , Mao et al . grew biofilms of the bacterium called Vibrio cholerae – which causes the disease cholera – on solid , non-growing ‘substrates’ . This work revealed that as the biofilms grow , their expansion is constrained by the substrate , and this situation generates mechanical stresses . To release the stresses , the biofilm initially folds to form wrinkles . Later , as the biofilm expands further , small parts of it detach from the substrate to form blisters . The same forces that keep water droplets spherical ( known as interfacial forces ) dictate how the blisters evolve , interact , and eventually shape the expanding biofilm . Using these principles , Yan et al . could engineer the biofilm into desired shapes . Collectively , the results presented by Yan et al . connect the shape of the biofilm surface with its material properties , in particular its stiffness . Understanding this relationship could help researchers to develop new ways to remove harmful biofilms , such as those that cause disease or that damage underwater structures . The stiffness of biofilms is already known to affect how well bacteria can resist antibiotics . Future studies could look for new genes or compounds that change the material properties of a biofilm , thereby altering the biofilm surface .
Epilepsy is a common brain disease that can cause disabling seizures . During a seizure , brain cells send out abnormal signals , which can mean that people having seizures may be unaware of their surroundings and may fall or otherwise injure themselves . Individuals with epilepsy develop changes in their brain cells and in the circuits that connect these cells together . Some people develop epilepsy because they have mutations in genes . Others develop the condition after an injury or a long seizure , which leads to changes in gene expression and therefore changes to the brain's cells and circuits . In 2011 , researchers found that a protein that normally switches off the expression of certain genes during brain development , but which is almost absent in the adult brain , may run amok after a seizure . The level of this protein—a transcription factor called NRSF—increased in the brains of rats that had been caused to have a seizure . A long provoked seizure caused many of the rats to develop epilepsy . But , if NRSF was blocked after the original seizure , the rats were less likely to have further seizures later on . Now McClelland et al . , including several of the researchers involved in the 2011 work , have examined what normally happens to the expression of genes after a seizure and what happens when the NRSF transcription factor is blocked . McClelland et al . found that only a small subset—about 10%—of the genes that can theoretically be silenced by NRSF are switched off in the brain when this protein's levels increase after a seizure . The increased NRSF levels , unexpectedly , did not affect the genes that bind tightly to this transcription factor . Nor did NRSF affect genes that bind loosely . Instead , the genes that the transcription factor binds to with an intermediate strength were the ones that were switched off . McClelland et al . suggest that this ‘mid-range binding’ to NRSF allows the expression of these genes to be increased or decreased in response to there being more or less NRSF in the cell . Genes that bind tightly to NRSF are likely to already have a lot of NRSF bound and are therefore already switched off; and loosely-binding genes would likely need even more NRSF before they are switched off . The subset of genes that were switched off by the increased levels of NRSF after a seizure code for a number of proteins that brain cells need to be able to effectively send and receive messages . Blocking the ability of NRSF to bind to these genes and switch them off may help to prevent the brain changes that cause epilepsy .
The brain often processes different features of sensory information in separate pathways . For example , when seeing an object , information about colour and movement are processed by separate types of neurons in the eye . These neurons in turn relay information to different sets of brain areas , all of which are active at the same time . Such parallel processing was originally not thought to apply to information about smell . This was because in mammals , the two types of neurons in the brain area that processes smell seemed to play the same role . However , more recent work suggests that there are in fact differences in the responses of these two neuron types ( called mitral cells and tufted cells ) to odors , suggesting that the brain might use parallel processing for information about smells too . Information travels along neurons in the form of electrical signals , and this activity is often seen in the form of a series of “spikes” . In a process called lateral inhibition , the activity of one neuron can feed back and inhibit the activity of its neighbors . This is important for enhancing contrast; in terms of the sense of smell , lateral inhibition is thought to help distinguish between similar odors . A technique called optogenetics allows the activity of particular neurons in an animal’s brain to be controlled by shining light onto them . Geramita et al . have now used this technique in mice to investigate whether there are differences in how lateral inhibition works in mitral cells and tufted cells . This revealed that lateral inhibition affects mitral cells only when they are spiking at intermediate firing rates , whereas tufted cells are only affected by lateral inhibition when spiking at low firing rates . Using computer simulations , Geramita et al . show that these different responses mean that mitral cells are best at distinguishing similar smells when they are present at high concentrations , while tufted cells are best at distinguishing similar smells that are present at low concentrations . These differences also mean that , by working together , mitral and tufted cells can distinguish between smells much better than either type of neuron on its own . These results demonstrate that , as with the other senses , the brain processes information about smell using parallel pathways . Future work is now needed to see what effect switching off the activity of either mitral or tufted cells will have on an animal’s behavior .
Proteins called G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) are found on the surface of cells throughout the body . Hormones or other signal molecules – collectively known as ligands – from outside the cell can bind to the receptors to activate them . This causes a change in the structure of the receptor , which triggers a signal inside the cell to alter the cell’s behavior . GPCRs are known to form clusters of two or more receptor units , but it is not known if these clusters have unique properties or what role they play in cells . Many drugs can bind to GPCRs and most of them block the activity of the receptors by taking the place of the natural ligand . Another way to alter the activity of a GPCR is with so-called 'allosteric' drugs . These bind to different sites on the receptor than the natural ligands do and can inhibit or enhance binding of the ligands by altering the shape of the receptor . Shivnaraine et al . investigated how a type of GPCR called muscarinic cholinergic receptors interact within clusters . This involved developing a method to track the receptor in mammalian cells using a fluorescent sensor that detects changes in the allosteric site . The experiments show that two or more GPCRs need to interact for the receptors to respond to allosteric drugs in a manner that reflects the normal effect of the drugs on the body . This result is unexpected in light of the assumption that individual receptor molecules act independently . Shivnaraine et al . ’s findings indicate that the clusters may play a role in the normal behavior of GPCRs in cells . A future challenge is to understand exactly how the GPCRs interact with each other .
Normal wear and tear , exposure to chemicals , and ultraviolet light can all damage DNA , so cells rely on a range of sensors and mechanisms to detect and repair damaged DNA . Cells also package DNA molecules inside structures called histones to protect them against damage . Double-strand breaks—one of the most serious forms of DNA damage—are detected by an enzyme called ATM , and can be repaired in two ways . Bringing the broken strands back together is an obvious method , but it is also error prone . Using templates to generate new DNA to repair the damage is less prone to error , but it can only happen at certain times of the cell cycle . Some cancers are linked to the faulty repair of double-strand breaks . Moreover , a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal carcinoma is linked to a lack of activity by a protein called p53 , even in individuals who don't have mutations in the gene for this protein . However , many people with this type of cancer have mutations in the gene for a protein called SETD2 . To investigate the links between SETD2 and DNA repair , Carvalho et al . compared cells with and without mutations in the gene for SETD2 . It emerged that SETD2 must be present for DNA repair to take place: the SETD2 modifies the histones so that they can recruit the enzymes that repair the DNA via the template approach ( which is relatively error free ) . SETD2 may be particularly important for repairing damage to genes without introducing errors . Carvalho et al . also show that mutations in SETD2 are sufficient to inactivate p53 . The gene for this protein , which impedes the proliferation of cells with genomic aberrations , such as double-strand breaks , is mutated in most cancers . Overall the results help to illustrate how histone modifications and the DNA damage repair mechanisms and checkpoints work in concert to suppress cancer .
Our DNA contains more than three billion nucleotides . Each of these nucleotides can be an A , C , G or T , and groups of three neighboring nucleotides within our DNA are used to represent the 20 amino acids that are used to make proteins . This means that changing just one nucleotide can cause one amino acid to be replaced by a different amino acid in the protein encoded by that stretch of DNA: AAA and AAG code for the amino acid lysine , for example , but AAC and AAT code for asparagine . Known as missense gene variants , these changes can also increase or decrease the expression of the gene . Every person has thousands of missense gene variants , including about 12 , 000 inherited from their parents . Sometimes these variants have no consequence , but they can be harmful if replacing the correct amino acid with a different amino acid prevents the protein from performing an important task . In particular , missense gene variants in genes that encode immune system proteins are likely to play a role in diseases of the immune system . For example , variants near a gene called Rasgrp1 have been linked to two autoimmune diseases – type 1 diabetes and Graves’ disease—in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own cells and tissues . Now Daley et al . have shed new light on the mechanism by which a missense gene variant in Rasgrp1 can cause autoimmune diseases . Mice with this mutation show signs of autoimmune disease , but their T cells—white blood cells that have a central role in the immune system – develop normally despite this mutation . Instead , Daley et al . found that a specific type of T cell , called T helper cells , accumulated in large numbers in the mutant mice and stimulated cells of a third type—immune cells called B cells—to produce autoantibodies . The production of autoantibodies is a common feature of autoimmune diseases . Daley et al . traced the origins of the T helper cells to excessive activity on a signaling pathway that involves a protein called mTOR , and went on to show that treatment with the drug rapamycin counteracted the accumulation of the T helper cells and reduced the level of autoimmune activity . In addition to exemplifying how changing just one amino acid change can have a profound effect , the work of Daley et al . is an attractive model for exploring how missense gene variants in people can contribute to autoimmune diseases .
The pancreas produces many different hormones , as well as several substances important for digestion . To perform these roles , the pancreas contains different types of cells; for example , acinar cells make digestive enzymes that help to break down food . But , like other cells in the body , pancreatic cells can accumulate mutations in their DNA that cause them to divide , acquire an altered identity and form a cancerous tumor . The DNA of cells is packed into a structure called chromatin . While the DNA sequence is essentially the same across all normal cells of a given individual , chromatin can be more or less compacted in the different cell types that comprise our body tissues . A collection of proteins called the SWI/SNF complex can reorganize the chromatin to change how tightly the DNA is packed . This determines which genes in the DNA are accessible and can be activated , and which ones cannot . Around 25% of pancreatic cancers contain mutations in genes that produce proteins of the SWI/SNF complex . These mutations normally occur with an additional mutation that over-activates the gene that produces a potentially cancer-causing protein called Kras . Livshits et al . have now genetically engineered mice to investigate how one such SWI/SNF complex protein , called Arid1a , affects how pancreatic cancer develops using a genetic approach that made possible to temporarily halt the production of Arid1a in acinar cells by feeding these mice an antibiotic . The gene that produces Kras was also over-activated in the pancreases of the mice , making them more likely to develop cancer . Within just two weeks of stopping the production of Arid1a , the acinar cells stopped producing digestive enzymes and started making other proteins that are typically found in cancerous cells , indicating that Arid1a is involved in maintaining the normal identity and activity of these cells . Restoring the ability of altered acinar cells to produce normal levels of Arid1a ( by removing the mice from the antibiotic diet ) did not reverse these changes . Biochemical experiments showed that acinar cells with reduced levels of Arid1a have altered chromatin . In particular , the genes that produce digestive enzymes , which are normally active in healthy pancreases , were less accessible in mice who had over-active Kras and reduced levels of Arid1a . The results presented by Livshits et al . provide the first evidence of how alterations to Arid1a can lead to irreversible changes in the identity and activity of pancreatic acinar cells . These results will need to be carefully considered by researchers who are developing treatments for cancer patients with mutations in Arid1a and other SWI/SNF proteins . In particular , methods that attempt to restore the functions of absent SWI/SNF proteins to cancer cells are unlikely to treat the cancer successfully .
Many species , including humans , use social interaction to reduce the effects of stress . In fact , the lack of a social network may itself be a source of stress . Recent research suggests that young girls are more sensitive to social stress than boys . This could mean that social networks are more important for females in general , and that young females from different species , such as mice , may be more sensitive to social isolation than males . However , few studies have examined how social isolation affects the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones . As such , it remains unknown whether isolating individuals from their social group impacts on the brain in sex-specific ways . Senst , Baimoukhametova et al . now show that the brains of young male and female mice react differently to social isolation . Less than a day after separation from their littermates , the activity in the brain cells of female mice became markedly different from that of isolated males . In contrast to social isolation , the physical stress of being made to swim produced similar changes in the brains of both male and female mice . Further experiments then showed that the changes in the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones required a signalling chemical called corticosterone , which is produced in response to stressful situations . This suggests that , in repsonse to soical isolation , the females are experiencing more stress than the males . Following on from this work , one future challenge will be to investigate if reuniting a social group erases the effects of social isolation on the brain . Further experiments could also examine the behavioural and physiological effects of social isolation , including how females respond to later stressful events .
In humans and other mammals , a protein in the blood called hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body . This protein contains four subunits that can each bind to one molecule of oxygen , so a single hemoglobin can carry up to four oxygen molecules at the same time . Previous studies have found that , although each subunit can potentially bind oxygen on its own , the subunits actually work together to help each other bind to oxygen in the body . Two biochemical properties of hemoglobin affect how it carries oxygen molecules . First , oxygen-binding affinity , or how tightly the protein can bind to oxygen; and secondly cooperativity , or the degree to which the subunits interact with each other to bind oxygen more tightly . Mammals of different shapes and sizes have different requirements for transporting oxygen from the lungs to organ tissues , which have shaped their hemoglobin proteins over evolutionary timescales . While the contribution of affinity to hemoglobin evolution in animals of different sizes has been addressed in the past , the role of cooperativity in hemoglobin adapting to body size has remained unclear . Here , Rapp and Yifrach used a mathematical approach to analyze existing data from 14 different mammals – including mice , sheep , humans and elephants – on how oxygen binds to hemoglobin . Using this approach , they were able to explain why different mammalian hemoglobins present different oxygen-binding affinity and cooperativity values . Furthermore , they demonstrated that the cooperativity values were very close to the maximum they could be for each version of hemoglobin . These findings suggest that , as mammals evolved , genetic mutations that altered the oxygen-binding affinity or the ability of hemoglobin subunits to cooperate may have allowed hemoglobin proteins to adapt to meet the oxygen needs of mammals of different sizes and shapes . In the future , the approach used by Rapp and Yifrach could be adapted to study how other proteins that bind molecules in a cooperative manner have evolved .
Malaria remains a devastating disease in many parts of the world . Malaria parasites enter the host via the skin , where they are deposited by infected mosquitoes as they look for blood . The parasites must exit the skin to reach the liver , where they multiply and ultimately infect red blood cells , where they cause the symptoms of the disease . In the skin , the parasites must move to find blood vessels that they enter to travel via the blood circulation to the liver . Only about 10–20% of parasites make it out of the skin , making this a bottleneck for the parasite . Scientists have been working to develop vaccines that would protect people against malaria . One way these could work would be to stop malaria parasites from leaving the skin and entering the blood vessels . But to do that , more needs to be learnt about how the parasites move in the skin and enter the blood vessels . Hopp et al . , using a mouse model of malaria , created malaria parasites that produce a fluorescent protein that allows the parasites to be tracked after they have been injected into the skin of a mouse's ear . This revealed that the parasites have two ways of moving . After first being injected , the parasites move quickly and freely . The parasites slow down when they come close to a blood vessel and move on or around the vessel for some time before entering it . During this stage of movement , the parasites tend to move in paths that follow the curvature of the blood vessels , which may improve how well they make contact with the blood vessel surface and may enable them to find the areas of the vessels best suited for entry . Next , Hopp et al . investigated how two parasite mutants move through mouse skin . Both mutants had previously been found to be less likely than wild-type parasites to exit the inoculation site . Hopp et al . found that one of the mutants moves slowly after being injected and so explores a smaller tissue volume than normal and encounters fewer blood vessels . The second mutant parasite spends more time than normal moving on the surface of the blood vessels , but finds it difficult to enter them . Continuing this work will allow us to learn more about the interactions between the parasite and the blood vessels , which in turn could reveal key events that could be targeted by a vaccine . Furthermore , the significant amount of time that the parasites spend moving and looking for blood vessels in the skin could be a good time to target them with antibodies and prevent malaria infection .
Cells use the genetic instructions provided by genes in particular combinations called ‘modules’ to perform particular jobs . Very different organisms can share many of the same modules because certain abilities are fundamental to the survival of all cells and so they have been retained over the course of evolution . That said , these modules may not necessarily involve the same genes because it is often possible to achieve the same result using different components . One way to study how those modules can diversify is to deliberately disrupt one of the genes in a module , and observe how the organism and its descendants respond over many generations . Other genes in these organisms may acquire genetic mutations that enable the genes to take on the role of the missing protein . However , the removal of a single component can be detrimental to the survival of the organisms or may affect many different processes . This can make it difficult to understand what is going on . A gene called BEM1 is crucial for yeast cells to establish polarity , that is , to allow the different sides of a cell to become distinct from one another . This activity is essential for the yeast to replicate itself . Previous studies have shown that the BEM1 gene had a different role in other species of fungi , which suggests that yeast may have other genes that previously assumed the role that BEM1 does now . In this study , Laan et al . removed BEM1 from yeast and allowed the population of mutant cells to evolve for a thousand generations . The approach differs from previous studies because Laan et al . deliberately selected for yeast that had acquired multiple genetic mutations that can together almost fully compensate for the loss of BEM1 . Initially , the mutant cells grew very slowly , were abnormal in shape and likely to burst open . However , by the end of the experiment , the cells were able to grow almost as well as the original yeast cells had before the gene deletion . Genetic analysis revealed that the deletion of BEM1 triggers the inactivation of other genes that are also involved in the regulation of polarity , which largely restored the ability of the disrupted polarity module to work . This restoration follows a ‘reproducible trajectory’ , as the same genes were switched off in the same order in different populations of yeast that were studied at the same time . The work is an example of reproducible evolution , whereby a specific order of changes to gene activity repeatedly enables cells with severe defects in important processes to adapt and restore a gene module , using whatever components they have left . The next challenge will be to understand how the particular roles of important modules affect their adaptability .
Humans , in general , are not particularly good at making economic decisions . People can be influenced by unhelpful biases: such as ‘loss aversion’ where a person views losses as more significant than gains . Sometimes these biases stop us making the decisions that offer the best reward , as such , they raise the question: why do these biases exist at all ? One way to examine this question is by looking at the brain activity of people making economic decisions . Two regions near the front of the brain are known to be involved in human decision-making in response to rewards . However , many researchers disagree as to what these two regions are actually doing when we make economic decisions . Much of the research in this area has asked participants to essentially gamble on a series of independent events , which typically provide a one-off instant reward with no further positive consequences . However , these tasks do not accurately reflect real economic decisions . In real life situations , people tend to take time to make a decision , and weigh up the potential long-term costs and benefits of an investment . Indeed the decision itself may be deferred until enough information is gathered; for example , very few people would choose to buy a house on the spur of the moment . Now Tsetsos et al . have attempted to bridge the gap between previous studies and everyday experiences by designing a task that encompasses many of the factors involved in real life decision-making . In this task , participants were given the option of deciding whether to commit to , or reject , an investment opportunity immediately; or to choose to defer making the decision until later—similar to how a person might wait to view different properties before deciding which house to buy . Using brain imaging , Tsetsos et al . found that one of the two brain regions ( called the dorsal ACC for short ) was involved in weighing up the cost of rejecting an offer , but not accepting it . The other region ( called the rostromedial prefrontal cortex or rmPFC ) was involved in assessing the value of an offer only when the participant decided to defer making a decision , and not when they decided to commit . Furthermore , by using computer simulations , Tsetsos et al . found that , with this more realistic task , biases such as loss aversion were in fact beneficial and helped participants to make decisions that increased their financial payoff . This suggests that the ‘unhelpful biases’ often seen in traditional decision making tasks may be a result of participants’ real life strategies failing to work when applied to an artificial situation . In other words , perhaps humans are not so bad at economic decision-making after all .
Many biological features of animals , including body temperature and hormone levels , follow daily rhythms that repeat every 24 hours . These so-called circadian rhythms are driven by an internal body clock and are essential for the organism to adapt to the daily cycle of light and dark . Circadian rhythms also take place inside individual cells – for example , the amount of a given protein in a cell often rises and falls over each 24-hour period . To generate these daily fluctuations , the processes used to make proteins based on the instructions encoded within a gene must be carefully controlled . Genes are first copied or ‘transcribed' into intermediate molecules called messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) . These mRNA molecules must then travel out of the cell’s nucleus before they can be de-coded to produce proteins . This means that daily fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels could occur because the rate at which the DNA is transcribed fluctuates or because controlling the steps that occur after transcription . However it is not clear how much these post-transcriptional steps contribute to circadian rhythms inside cells . Recently , structures called paraspeckles were seen inside the nucleus . These structures are made from a long RNA molecule that does not code for a protein , and a number of proteins that can bind mRNA molecules . Paraspeckles are thought to prevent certain mRNAs from leaving the nucleus and therefore stop them from being decoded to make proteins . Torres et al . have now investigated whether paraspeckles may play a role in circadian rhythms . Torres et al . looked at the long non-coding RNA and several proteins that are known to be components of paraspeckles in cells taken from the pituitary glands of rats using a variety of techniques . These cells were chosen because they were known to have a working circadian clock . The analysis showed that the levels of these components , as well as the number of paraspeckles within the nucleus , changed over the course of a daily cycle . Torres et al . then confirmed that mRNAs containing a sequence that is known to recruit mRNAs to paraspeckes ( the IRAlu sequence ) could be also retained in the nucleus or released with a circadian rhythm . This pattern was lost when the paraspeckles were disrupted . These findings suggest that daily fluctuations in protein levels can be post-transcriptionally controlled by paraspeckles rhythmically retaining mRNAs in the nucleus . Future studies could explore whether it may be possible to control circadian rhythms by targeting the paraspeckles , which could help to improve conditions where the internal body clock goes wrong .
The electrical signals that neurons use to rapidly transmit information along their length cannot cross the gaps—called synapses—that separate one neuron from the next . Instead , the signals trigger the release of chemicals called neurotransmitters , which then stimulate a corresponding electrical signal in a neighboring neuron . Inside the neuron , the neurotransmitters are packaged into structures called vesicles and are released across the synapse when the vesicle merges with the cell membrane at a location called the active zone . Calcium ions move through proteins known as calcium channels , which are embedded in the neuron's cell membrane in the active zone , and cause the vesicle to merge with the neuron's membrane and release its contents into the synapse . A protein called Munc13 is also important for helping to release neurotransmitters , which it does by binding to various other proteins in the active zone known to be critical for the process of allowing the vesicle and cell membranes to merge . Now , Calloway et al . have found that Munc13 also interacts with the calcium channels . The experiments used genetic tools to eliminate or mutate Munc13 in rat neurons . Electrical impulses were then applied to these neurons and the flow of calcium ions was monitored at the synapses . The results showed that Munc13 controls when the calcium channels open and close in response to nerve impulses . Further experiments revealed the specific region of the Munc13 protein that interacts with the calcium channels . Mutations to this part of Munc13 affected the ability of the calcium channels to open and close . The results indicate that active zone proteins such as Munc13 can potentially play multiple roles in controlling neurotransmitter release . It seems unlikely that Munc13 is the only calcium channel partner that helps sculpt information transfer at synapses . Future studies could investigate how multiple partners work together to determine the behavior of calcium channels in specific locations and at specific times , and how this interplay affects how well synapses work in the brain .
Cells with complex interlocking shapes , similar to pieces of a jigsaw puzzle , cover the surface of many leaves . Why do these curious shapes form , and what benefit do they provide to the plant ? Plant cells are like small balloons surrounded by a strong cell wall . Their internal pressure can be higher than the pressure in a car tire . It is this pressure that gives non-woody plant tissue its shape . Take away the pressure , and the plant wilts . The pressure inside a cell creates a lot of mechanical stress on the epidermal cell walls – those that make up the surface of the plant . The extent of the stress depends on the shape and size of the cells; for example , large cells bulge out and experience more stress than small cells . This could mean that the shape of puzzle cells is an adaptation used by plants to reduce the stress on their surface . To investigate this possibility , Sapala , Runions et al . developed a computer simulation that models how a plant grows and re-creates a variety of realistic puzzle cell shapes . The simulations show that ‘paving’ the leaf surface with puzzle shaped cells instead of more regularly shaped cells reduces the stress in the epidermal cell walls . Counterintuitively , the simulations also show that complex puzzle shapes develop in parts of the plant that grow isotropically ( uniformly in all directions ) , such as leaves . If a plant organ grows mostly in one direction , like in a root or stem , long thin cells are sufficient to reduce the stress on the epidermal cell wall . Sapala , Runions et al . tested this idea by analyzing the shape of organs and cells in many plant species and by genetically modifying growth directions in Arabidopsis thaliana plants . This confirmed that puzzle cell shape is related to both organ shape and how isotropically the plant grows . It had previously been proposed that mobile chemical signals passed between cells coordinate the process by which a lobe in one puzzle cell matches an indentation in its neighbor . However , the model developed by Sapala , Runions et al . does not require such chemical signaling . Instead , mechanical forces and the shape the puzzle cells themselves may transmit this information . Mechanical forces are known to have important effects on the shape and behavior of cells from other species too . For example , animal cells can develop into different cell types depending on the stiffness of the surface they are placed on . Now that Sapala , Runions et al . have highlighted that plant cell shapes also adapt to mechanical forces , further research is needed to uncover how these forces are sensed .
A gene is a segment of DNA that usually carries the information required to build a protein , the molecules responsible for most of life’s processes . This DNA segment is organized in modules , with coding sections separated by portions of non-coding DNA known as introns . When a gene is ‘turned on’ , it gets faithfully copied into a molecule of pre-messenger RNA ( pre-mRNA ) , which contains the alternating coding and non-coding modules . Before it can serve as a template to create a protein , this pre-mRNA must be processed and all the introns removed by a structure called the spliceosome . If this delicate process goes wrong , inaccurate protein templates are produced that may be damaging for the cell . Spliceosomes are precise molecular ‘scissors’ that can recognize where a coding module stops and an intron starts , and then make a snip in the pre-mRNA to remove the non-coding sequence . The spliceosome is a complex molecular machine formed of numerous parts – including one known as U1 snRNP – that must come together . When a pre-mRNA has several introns , a spliceosome assembles anew for each of them . Braun et al . designed a new method that allows them to ‘tag’ spliceosomes extracted from a human cell and follow them as they come together . The experiments show that spliceosomes working on different introns in the same pre-mRNA actually help each other out . As one assembles , this helps the spliceosome that processes the neighboring intron to get built . In particular , the U1 snRNPs processing nearby introns collaborate to promote the assembly and activity of the spliceosomes . This teamwork is likely important to guarantee that multiple introns are cut out quickly and accurately .
Proteins carry out almost every process that happens inside a cell . Like all machines , their ability to work properly depends on their three-dimensional shape and structure . To make proteins , building blocks called amino acids are first assembled into a string that , like wool in a sweater , needs to be knitted into the final three-dimensional structure . How proteins reach their 3D structure is called “folding” , and when protein folding fails , or is not so efficient , it can cause very severe diseases . Protein folding is not as nicely progressive as knitting a sweater: it is more like putting all the wool into a big messy blob that then suddenly turns into a protein with the right three-dimensional structure . Cells have machinery that can detect messy-looking molecules and destroy them . Therefore , new proteins need to be hidden from this machinery until they have finished folding . A human protein called LRP6 is found on the surface of cells and it plays an important role in allowing cells to communicate with each other . Like many other proteins , LRP6 is produced inside the cell in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum and is then exported to the cell surface . In 2008 , a team of researchers found that LRP6 is modified in a particular way known as S-palmitoylation before it leaves the endoplasmic reticulum . This suggested that there is a system that helps this protein to fold correctly . Here Perrody , Abrami et al . – including some of the researchers from the previous work – used biochemical techniques to investigate how LRP6 folds . The experiments show that another type of protein modification that involves attaching a molecule called ubiquitin to LRP6 promotes this protein’s folding . Once the protein is folded , the ubiquitin is removed from LRP6 by an enzyme called USP19 . Further experiments show that this system also helps to ensure that two other important proteins fold correctly . The next steps following on from this work are to identify the other molecules involved in this protein folding system . A future challenge is to find out how this system protects new proteins from being degraded while they are still folding .
When faced with a decision to make , humans and other animals reflect on past experiences of similar situations to choose the best option . However , in an uncertain situation , this decision process requires balancing two competing priorities: exploiting options that are expected to be rewarding ( exploitation ) , and exploring alternatives that could be more valuable ( exploration ) . Decision making and exploration are disrupted in many mental disorders , some of which can differ in either presentation or risk of development across women and men . This raises the question of whether sex differences in exploration and exploitation could contribute to the vulnerability to these conditions . To shed light on this question , Chen et al . studied exploration in male and female mice as they played a video game . The mice had the option to touch one of two locations on a screen for a chance to win a small reward . The likelihood of success was different between the two options , and so the mice were incentivized to determine which was the more rewarding button . While the mice were similarly successful in finding rewards regardless of sex , on average male mice were more likely to keep exploring between the options while female mice more quickly gained confidence in an option . These differences were stronger during uncertain periods of learning and exploration than when making choices in a well-known situation , indicating that periods of uncertainty are when the influence of sex on cognition are most visible . However , not every female or male mouse was the same – there was as much variability within a sex as was seen between sexes . These results indicate that sex mechanisms , along with many other influences cause individual differences in the cognitive processes important for decision making . The approach used by Chen et al . could help to study individual differences in cognition in other species , and shed light on how individual differences in decision-making processes could contribute to risk and resilience to mental disorders .
The inside of a cell contains many different compartments called organelles , which are separated by membranes . Each organelle is composed of a unique set of proteins and performs specific roles in the cell . The endoplasmic reticulum , or ER for short , is an organelle where many proteins are produced . Most of these proteins are then released from the cell or sorted to other organelles . The ER has a strict quality control system that ensures any faulty proteins are quickly marked for the cell to destroy . However , the destruction process itself does not happen in the ER , so faulty proteins first need to leave this organelle . This is achieved by a group of proteins known as endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation machinery ( or ERAD for short ) . To extract a faulty protein from the ER , proteins of the ER and outside the ER cooperate . First , an ERAD protein called Doa10 attaches a small protein tag called ubiquitin to the faulty proteins to mark them for destruction . Then , outside of the ER , a protein called Cdc48 ‘grabs’ the ubiquitin tag and pulls . But that is only part of the story . Many of the proteins made by the ER have tethers that anchor them firmly to the membrane , making them much harder to remove . To get a better idea of how the extraction works , Schmidt et al . rebuilt the ERAD machinery in a test tube . This involved purifying proteins from yeast and inserting them into artificial membranes , allowing closer study of each part of the process . This revealed that attaching ubiquitin tags to faulty proteins is only one part of Doa10's role; it also participates in the extraction itself . Part of Doa10 resides within the membrane , and this ‘membrane-spanning domain’ can interact with faulty proteins , loosening their membrane anchors . At the same time , Cdc48 pulls from the outside . This pulling force causes the faulty proteins to unfold , allowing them to pass through the membrane . Given these findings , the next step is to find out exactly how Doa10 works by looking at its three-dimensional structure . This could have implications not only for the study of ERAD , but of similar quality control processes in other organelles too . A build-up of faulty proteins can cause diseases like neurodegeneration , so understanding how cells remove faulty proteins could help future medical research .
Morphogens play a crucial role in determining how cells are organized in developing organisms . These chemical signals act over a wide area , and the amount of signal each cell receives typically initiates a sequence of events that spatially pattern the multiple cells of an organ or tissue . One of the most well-studied groups of morphogens are the hedgehog proteins , which are involved in the development of many animals , ranging from flies to humans . In fruit flies , hedgehog proteins kickstart a cascade of molecular changes that switch on a set of 'target' genes . They do this by ultimately altering the activity of a protein called cubitus interruptus , which comes in two lengths: a long version called Ci-155 and a short version called Ci-75 . When hedgehog is absent , Ci-155 is kept in an inactive state in the cytoplasm , where it is slowly converted into its shorter form , Ci-75: this repressor protein is then able to access the nucleus , where it switches ‘off’ the target genes . However , when a hedgehog signal is present , the processing of Ci into its shorter form is inhibited . Instead , Ci-155 becomes activated by a separate mechanism that allows the long form protein to enter the nucleus and switch ‘on’ the target genes . But it was unclear whether hedgehog requires both of these mechanisms in order to act as a morphogen and regulate the activity of developmental genes . To answer this question , Little et al . mutated the gene for Ci in the embryo of fruit flies , so that the Ci-155 protein could no longer be processed into Ci-75 . Examining the developing wings of these flies revealed that the genes targeted by hedgehog are still activated in the correct pattern . In some parts of the wing , Ci-75 is required to switch off specific sets of genes . But when Little et al . blocked these genes , by adding a gene that constantly produces the Ci repressor in the presence or absence of hedgehog , the adult flies still developed normally structured wings . This suggests that hedgehog does not need to regulate the processing of Ci-155 into Ci-75 in order to perform its developmental role . Previous work showed that when one of the major mechanisms used by hedgehog to activate Ci-155 is blocked , fruit flies are still able to develop normal wings . Taken together with the findings of Little et al . , this suggests that the two mechanisms induced by hedgehog can compensate for each other , and independently regulate the development of the fruit fly wing . These mechanisms , which are also found in humans , have been linked to birth defects and several common types of cancer , and understanding how they work could help the development of new treatments .
Despite being unpleasant , pain is critical to survival because it acts as a warning for damage or impending harm . Day-to-day pain like a stubbed toe or a pricked finger is called acute pain . It alerts the body to harm but only lasts a short time and usually goes away on its own . Pain that persists more than three months after the damaged tissue has healed is known as chronic pain , and it is a serious problem that is often difficult to treat . Learning more about the causes of chronic pain is necessary to help develop more effective therapies . Nerve pathways in the spinal cord help process pain and other sensory information from the skin and relay it to the brain . These pathways include sensory fibers that carry pain information from the body to the spinal cord , as well as cells that relay this information to the brain . But not much is known about how the nerves and cells in this region prioritize or refine sensory information before sending it to the brain . Now , Smith et al . have used mice to show that nerve cells in the spinal cord that produce the protein calretinin can act as a pain amplifier , causing it to persist . A technique called optogenetics was used to turn on calretinin nerve cells by exposing them to light . This caused the mice to behave like they were in pain even though they had not been harmed , and the behaviour stopped when they were treated with morphine , a powerful painkiller . Further experiments showed that calretinin nerve cells form a highly interconnected network in the spinal cord . These results show that calretinin nerve cells can ‘jump-start’ the pain pathway within the spinal cord , even when there is no painful stimulation of the skin . Turning on these cells even briefly causes behaviours associated with prolonged pain . By revealing that networks of calretinin nerve cells in the spinal cord act like an in-built pain amplifier , the experiments identify these cells as a potential target for new treatments for chronic pain .
In many animals , the skull is made of several separate bones that are loosely joined during childhood and only fuse into one piece when the animal stops growing . A genetic disease called Carpenter syndrome causes the bones of the skull to fuse early in life , stopping it from growing correctly . Carpenter syndrome is often caused by changes to the gene responsible for making a protein called RAB23 . RAB23 helps move other molecules and cell components between different parts of the cell , and is therefore involved in a number of cellular processes . Previous studies suggest that RAB23 has a role in many parts of the body during development . Yet , it is unclear which cells in the skull depend on RAB23 activity and how this protein is controlled . To answer this question , Hasan et al . grew pieces of developing skull bones that had been taken from mice lacking the RAB23 protein in the laboratory . Examining these samples revealed that RAB23 is active in cells called osteoblasts that add new bone to the edge of each piece of the skull as it grows . Hasan et al . also found that RAB23 regulates two cellular signaling pathways – called the hedgehog pathway and the fibroblast growth factor pathway – that interact with one another and co-ordinate skull development . These findings show how RAB23 controls the growth and fusion of skull bones in developing animals . This could improve our understanding of the role RAB23 plays in other processes during development . It also sheds light on the mechanisms of Carpenter syndrome which may inform new approaches for treating patients .
Genetic material is contained within molecules of DNA . In plants and many other organisms , these DNA molecules are packaged around proteins called histones to make a structure known as chromatin . Altering how the DNA is packaged in chromatin can control the activity of genes . For example , a group of proteins called the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) adds methyl tags to histones , which can alter the packaging of chromatin to lower the activity of particular genes . When a cell divides , it is sometimes important that genes in the daughter cells have similar levels of activity as the parent cell . This allows individual cells to ‘remember’ past events , such as exposure to cold temperatures or other environmental conditions . The pattern of methyl tags on histones can be passed onto the daughter cells , but it is not clear if this is actually responsible for providing the memory . One gene that PRC2 regulates is called FLC , which influences when a plant called Arabidopsis produces flowers . If the plants are exposed to cold temperatures , the activity of FLC is repressed . FLC activity remains low after the period of cold has ended to ensure that the plants produce flowers at an appropriate time . If this 'memory of cold' is held locally in the chromatin of the FLC gene , then it should be possible for two copies of the FLC gene in the same cell to show different gene activities . However , if the memory is stored more globally inside each cell by other proteins , then the two copies should have identical gene activities . To distinguish between these two possibilities , Berry et al . added different fluorescent tags to two copies of the FLC gene in Arabidopsis plants , which allowed the activity of each gene copy to be tracked in individual cells under a microscope . The experiments show that one copy of FLC may be switched off , while the other remains switched on inside the same cell . Furthermore , it was found that this pattern of gene activity is passed onto the daughter cells when the original cell divides . Berry et al . 's findings show that the memory of FLC gene activity is stored locally in the chromatin of the FLC gene itself . The alteration of histones by PRC2 is one important aspect of the packaging of chromatin . The next challenge is to identify what other features of chromatin are required for a gene to be able to store this memory locally .
Proteins are composed of long chains of amino acids that fold on themselves to form three-dimensional structures . Many proteins are made in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum and ‘chaperone’ proteins help them fold correctly . Cells carefully regulate the levels of chaperone proteins . If there are too few chaperones in the cell , then newly-made proteins may fold incorrectly and interrupt other processes . On the other hand , if too many chaperones are present they may slow down the protein folding process . If a cell experiences stressful conditions , or if there is a sudden demand for more proteins to be made , protein folding can be disrupted . This leads to an increase in the number of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and so the cell increases the levels of chaperone proteins to cope with this . Hsp70 chaperones are one family of chaperone proteins . These proteins can be present in a cell as single molecules ( monomers ) or as a group of several chaperone molecules ( oligomers ) . Previous research has suggested that the chaperone proteins in oligomers are inactive , but the oligomers may be rapidly broken down into monomers when the cell needs to fold more proteins . A region within the Hsp70 called the ‘interdomain linker’ is important for regulating the chaperone activity , but it is not clear if this is connected to the formation of oligomers . Preissler et al . used biochemical techniques to study how an Hsp70 protein in the endoplasmic reticulum called BiP forms oligomers . The experiments show that oligomers form when the interdomain linker of one BiP molecule is bound to the region of an adjacent BiP molecule that is normally reserved for binding to unfolded proteins . The presence of the interdomain linker makes it more difficult for unfolded proteins to bind . Further experiments challenged cells with chemicals that caused the number of unfolded proteins in the cells to increase . Under these conditions , there was a decrease in the number of BiP molecules associated with oligomers . Preissler et al . propose that BiP oligomers act as reservoirs to store BiP molecules when they aren't needed by the cell . However , when the levels of unfolded proteins rise , cells can rapidly break up these oligomers to make active monomers that help to deal with the excess numbers of unfolded proteins . Further work is needed to understand how changes in the number of unfolded proteins in cells leads to the formation and disassembly of BiP oligomers .
A group of “flexible filamentous” viruses can cause serious diseases in a wide variety of crops and other plants . Each virus particle contains a single molecule called ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , which is protected by hundreds of copies of a coat protein . The RNA and coat proteins are arranged in a helical fashion to make a flexible rod-shaped particle . The flexibility of these viruses makes it difficult to carry out in-depth studies of their three-dimensional structures . As a result , we do not know how the RNA and coat proteins interact to form the structure of each virus particle . Agirrezabala et al . used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy ( or cryoEM for short ) to generate a highly detailed three-dimensional model of a flexible filamentous virus called Pepino Mosaic Virus . Agirezabala et al . ’s findings reveal how the virus particles assemble , and the interactions between the coat protein and the ssRNA . Unexpectedly , the structure of the coat protein from Pepino Mosiac Virus is very similar to the structure of “nucleoproteins” from a group of viruses called the Phleboviruses , which infect animals . This similarity is striking and suggests that the gene that encodes these proteins has been transferred between the two groups of viruses during evolution . A future challenge is to find out whether this similarity extends to other groups of viruses .
Antibodies play a key role in the immune system . These proteins stick to harmful substances , such as bacteria and other disease-causing pathogens , marking them for destruction or blocking their attack . Antibodies are highly selective , and this ability has been used to target particular molecules in research , diagnostics and therapies . Typically , antibodies need to stick to a particular segment , or ‘epitope’ , on the surface of a cell in order to trigger an immune response . Knowing where these regions are can help explain how these immune proteins work and aid the development of more effective drugs and diagnostic tools . One way to identify these sites is to measure the nano-distance between antibodies and other features on the cell surface . To do this , researchers take multiple images of the cell the antibody is attached to using light microscopy . Various statistical methods are then applied to create an ‘average image’ that has a higher resolution and can therefore be used to measure the distance between these two points more accurately . While this approach works on fixed shapes , like a perfect circle , it cannot handle human cells and bacteria which are less uniform and have more complex surfaces . Here , Kumra Ahnlide et al . have developed a new method called SiteLoc which can overcome this barrier . The method involves two fluorescent probes: one attached to a specific site on the cell’s surface , and the other to the antibody or another molecule of interest . These two probes emit different colours when imaged with a fluorescent microscope . To cope with objects that have uneven surfaces , such as cells and bacteria , the two signals are transformed to ‘follow’ the same geometrical shape . The relative distance between them is then measured using statistical methods . Using this approach , Kumra Ahnlide et al . were able to identify epitopes on a bacterium , and measure distances on the surface of human red blood cells . The SiteLoc system could make it easier to develop antibody-based treatments and diagnostic tools . Furthermore , it could also be beneficial to the wider research community who could use it to probe other questions that require measuring nanoscale distances .
