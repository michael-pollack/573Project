         "Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development , yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms . In the C . elegans germline , reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation . Here , we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway . This is surprising , since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors . Through a combination of genetics , tissue-specific transcriptome analysis , and functional studies of candidate genes , we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch . We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes , silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming . These findings have wide implications , ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling .\nCell-fate decisions are controlled , on the one hand , by intercellular signaling and , on the other hand , by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications . The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al . , 1999; Greenwald and Kovall , 2013 ) , which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Notch signaling has also been implicated in cellular reprograming . Upon inhibition of Notch signaling , the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) from mouse and human keratinocytes ( Ichida et al . , 2014 ) . In this setting , Notch inhibits reprograming . Conversely , Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells ( Sawey et al . , 2007 ) , or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) ( Sekiya and Suzuki , 2012 ) . Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development . In C . elegans , signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and , during larval development , signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron ( Jarriault et al . , 2008; Djabrayan et al . , 2012 ) . The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment ( Meshorer and Misteli , 2006; Spivakov and Fisher , 2007; Lessard and Crabtree , 2010; Orkin and Hochedlinger , 2011 ) . Therefore , the epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood . Additionally , the impact of external cues , for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell’s chromatin remains equally unresolved . By contrast , C . elegans has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism ( Horner et al . , 1998; Fukushige et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1998; Fukushige and Krause , 2005; Ciosk et al . , 2006; Jarriault et al . , 2008; Yuzyuk et al . , 2009; Riddle et al . , 2013 ) . In this model , germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 ( Rbbp4/7 ) or components of PRC2 , and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1 , which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion ( GeCo ) ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model . This was unanticipated , since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden , 2007 ) . To understand this novel , reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch , we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling . We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch , including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , and unexpectedly , we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2 . We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target , utx-1 . Importantly , UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al . , 2011; Jin et al . , 2011; Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we propose that the GLP-1Notch–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates .\nGerm cells can be converted into neuronal cells in intact C . elegans upon overexpression of the neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 , simply by depleting the chromatin modifier LIN-53 ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . This GeCo phenotype can be followed in living animals by monitoring a reporter GFP expressed from the gcy-5 promoter , which otherwise is induced in glutamatergic ASE neurons ( Altun-Gultekin et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast to the spontaneous teratomatous differentiation of meiotic germ cells , observed in the absence of specific RNA-binding proteins ( Ciosk et al . , 2006; Biedermann et al . , 2009; Tocchini et al . , 2014 ) , GeCo is preferentially observed in the pre-meiotic , proliferating germ cells ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Consistently , removing the proliferating germ cells , by inhibiting GLP-1Notch signaling , prevents GeCo ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) . However , because the proliferating germ cells were eliminated , these experiments did not address a possible direct effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on GeCo . We began addressing this issue by examining the gonads of animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . These gonads are filled with proliferating germ cells and , upon depleting LIN-53 and overexpressing CHE-1 , we observed that significantly more germ cells converted to ASE neurons ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . We refer to this enhanced GeCo as 'GeCo+' . Detailed quantification revealed that the GeCo+ gonads contained more than twice the number of converted cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . The nuclei of these converted cells were reminiscent of neuronal nuclei and the cells displayed axo-dendritic projection ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) , as previously described ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . To confirm that the GeCo enhancement depends on the canonical Notch signaling pathway , rather than an independent function of the GLP-1Notch receptor , we RNAi-depleted the transcriptional effector of GLP-1Notch signaling , LAG-1 ( Christensen et al . , 1996 ) . We exposed animals only after hatching to lag-1 RNAi in order to avoid sterility , which is caused when animals are subjected to lag-1 RNAi earlier ( Supplemental file 1 ) . RNAi-mediated knock-down of lag-1 strongly inhibited GeCo ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Importantly , under these experimental conditions , we did not observe any obvious reduction of germ cell numbers ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—source data 1 ) , suggesting a proliferation-independent effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on cell-fate conversion . To investigate this further , we tested GeCo efficiency on germ cells proliferating independently of GLP-1Notch signaling . We took advantage of mutants in which , in the absence of two meiosis/differentiation-promoting factors GLD-1 and GLD-2 , germ cells proliferate independently of GLP-1Notch ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998 ) . Specifically , we examined GeCo in the loss-of-function gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutants , which carried either wild-type glp-1 or the loss-of-function glp-1 ( q175 ) allele ( Austin and Kimble , 1987 ) . Both mutant combinations have previously been described to have tumorous germlines and impaired meiotic entry ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast to efficient GeCo observed in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) gonads , GeCo was strongly diminished in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads , despite the ongoing germ cell proliferation ( Figure 1D , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Counting the number of germ cells in these gonads revealed only a slight difference ( a 15% increase in the numbers in the double vs . triple mutant gonads ) , suggesting that the strong enhancement of GeCo by GLP-1Notch signaling cannot be explained by the increased number of germ cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Since it has been proposed that dividing cells have a higher propensity for cellular reprograming ( Egli et al . , 2008; Hanna et al . , 2009 ) , we also tested whether blocking the cell cycle would affect the observed GeCo enhancement in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads . As previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) , we used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment to block the cell cycle in the S phase . Blocking the cell cycle by HU did not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Combined , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch enhances GeCo independently from its role in promoting germ cell proliferation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 003Figure 1 .

Left: Fluorescent ( top ) and combined fluorescent/differential interference contrast ( DIC ) micrographs ( bottom ) of adult animals . All animals ectopically expressed the pro-neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 from a heat-shock promoter . glp-1 ( ar202 ) is a temperature-sensitive gain-of-function allele of the Notch receptor . Animals were subjected to either mock ( control ) or lin-53 RNAi .

( A ) For the quantification of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm only the GeCo category of wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) was used because GeCo+ animals already show an extensive area of the gonad filled with gcy-5::gfp-positive cells with usually >100 cells/gonad making reliable counting impossible . Notably , animals with a seemingly similar extend of GeCo in wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) show a clear increase of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm from approx . 10 in wt to > 30 in glp-1 ( gf ) . n ( wt ) = 75 gonaldal arms , n ( glp-1 ( ar202 ) ) = 221 gonadal arms . The background of the loss of function allele glp-1 ( q175 ) leads to a significant decrease in GeCo as shown previously ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) .

Blocking the cell cycle with hydroxyurea does not inhibit GeCo+ . ( A ) We used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment for 5 hr to chemically block the cell cycle , which makes germ cells arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle . This arrest does not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads upon lin-53 RNAi and che-1 ( oe ) . At least 150 animals were quantified per condition . P-values were calculated using Student's t-test: p1=0 , 1409; p2=0 , 4583 . Error bars represent SEM .

After 12 hr of HU treatment , the gonads contained , as expected , enlargement nuclei ( arrowheads ) ( Gartner et al . , 2004; Fox et al . , 2011 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 007 To understand the effects of GLP-1Notch on GeCo , we set out to identify genes regulated by GLP-1Notch signaling in germ cells . To conduct the analysis in morphologically similar tissue , we again took advantage of the gld-1 gld-2 double mutants that , combined with either loss-of-function or gain-of-function glp-1 alleles , have morphologically similar gonads , filled with proliferating , undifferentiated germ cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . We combined gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutations with either the temperature-sensitive loss-of-function ( lf ) glp-1 allele ( e2144 ) , or the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function ( gf ) glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Priess et al . , 1987; Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . Because GLD-1 and GLD-2 regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level only , we expected that transcriptionally regulated GLP-1Notch targets could be identified in this background . To analyze gene expression , gonads were dissected from animals grown at the restrictive temperature in two independent experiments , and transcripts were analyzed with tiling arrays ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . We identified around 100 transcripts that were differentially expressed between the gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( lf ) ( Notch OFF ) and gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( gf ) ( Notch ON ) gonads ( Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . These changes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR ( RT-qPCR ) on selected transcripts ( Figure 2—figure supplement2A , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Most differentially expressed transcripts were upregulated in the ‘Notch ON’ gonads , indicating a predominantly activating role of GLP-1Notch in germ cells . For simplicity , we will refer to the transcripts upregulated at least two fold in the Notch ON gonads as ‘Notch–activated’ . Some Notch-activated genes , such as sel-8/Mastermind , lst-1 , and epn-1/Epsin , have been implicated in Notch signaling in other cell types ( Doyle et al . , 2000; Yoo , 2004; Tian et al . , 2004; Singh et al . , 2011; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . However , it remains possible that , rather than being direct GLP-1Notch targets , some of the Notch-activated genes were upregulated as an indirect consequence of increased GLP-1Notch signaling . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 008Figure 2 . GLP-1Notch and PRC2 regulate common targets and are functionally connected . ( A ) Notch-activated genes are biased for the sex chromosome linkage . Left: Changes in transcript abundance in the ‘Notch ON’ versus ‘OFF’ dissected gonads ( genotypes explained in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B ) were analyzed by microarrays . Transcripts upregulated at least 2-fold in the ‘Notch ON’ gonads are marked in red , those downregulated at least 2-fold in blue . Selected transcripts verified by RT-qPCR in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A are additionally circled in black . Right: 5426 genes can be considered expressed in the gonad , based on the bimodal distribution of expression values . Only 3% of those expressed genes are X-linked . In contrast , nearly half ( 46% ) of the expressed and Notch-activated transcripts are X-linked ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 2B for numbers ) . ( B ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 interact genetically . Left: DAPI-stained gonads from animals of the indicated genotypes . The mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z- single mutant gonads have wild-type appearance at 20°C . The glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function mutants have an almost wild-type appearance at this temperature , except for an extended proliferative zone in the gonad , referred to as 'distal tumor' . At the same temperature , mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) double mutants developed germline tumors in 32/32 of the examined gonads . The insets show close-ups from the indicated gonadal regions: the distal-most regions contain undifferentiated , proliferative germ cells in all mutants ( a , c , e ) . However , while the single mutants contain oocytes with characteristically condensed chromosomes in the proximal gonads ( b , d ) , the proximal gonads of the double mutants harbor proliferative germ cells ( f ) . Scale bar = 30 μm . Right: quantification of the phenotypes . 'Distal tumor' indicates the presence of an elongated distal proliferative zone ( approximately ½ of the distal gonad arm ) . 'Extended' tumor indicates an extended distal tumor , few oocytes , and frequently also a proximal tumor . 'Fully tumorous' indicates the absence of all differentiated cell types except for sperm produced during larval development . ( C ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 target the same genes on the X chromosomes . The plots correlate changes in gene expression in M+Z- mes-2 mutants with changes in gene expression changes in M+Z- mes-6 mutants . Results are shown separately for X-linked ( left ) and autosomal ( right ) transcripts . Notch-activated genes ( red in Figure 2A ) are marked in red . Lightly shaded areas indicate transcripts that are at least 2-fold upregulated . The overlap between transcripts upregulated by GLP-1Notch and transcripts upregulated by the loss of CePRC2 is highly significant , particularly for the X-linked genes . The significance of the correlation was measured by hypergeometric distribution; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 31e-31; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=7 . 41e-25; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 47e-22; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=1 . 8e-12 .

Examining transcriptional effects of GLP-1Notch signaling . ( A ) GLP-1Notch signaling counteracts the meiosis-promoting activity of several RNA binding proteins , of which GLD-1 and -2 are indicated . ( B ) Mutants that were used in this study: while the loss-of-function ( lf ) alleles of glp-1 cause the loss of germ cells , gain-of-function ( gf ) alleles result in a constitutive proliferation of germ cells . However , in the absence of the meiosis-promoting GLD-1 and GLD-2 proteins , germ cells continue to proliferate in the absence of GLP-1Notch activity .

The central planes of the gonads were imaged . Nuclei were counted from those images using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ .

Nonetheless , the double mutant strain reacts to enhancers , suppressors , and depletion of PRC2 components in a similar manner as the glp-1 ( ar202 ) single mutant strain , with the exception of mbk-1 and B0416 . 5 RNAi . Depletion of mes-2 and mes-3 by RNAi was ineffective , since it did not enhance the tumourous phenotype in either of the two strains .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 013 To demonstrate that Notch-activated genes are functionally relevant for germ cell proliferation , we performed RNAi knockdown of Notch-activated genes ( n = 64 ) on animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele , and screened for enhancement or suppression of the tumorous gonad phenotype ( Supplementary file 1; for detailed experimental procedure see Materials and Methods ) . Knocking down some of the Notch-activated genes suppressed the tumorous phenotype , which agrees with predominantly proliferation-promoting role of GLP-1Notch . Interestingly , knocking down a smaller subset of the Notch-activated genes enhanced the tumor ( Supplementary file 1 ) , suggesting that some of the Notch-activated genes may counteract proliferation . While some of these genes may function autonomously in the germline , others could affect the germline indirectly from the soma . To test this , we RNAi-depleted selected candidates in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) mutant background , which is permissive for RNAi in the germline but deficient in RNAi in many ( but not all ) somatic tissues ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . While depleting most candidates in the rrf-1 background had similar effects on the germline as in the wild type ( suggesting germline-autonomous function ) , in some cases the effects were abolished , suggesting that these genes function in the soma ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Strikingly , we noticed that Notch-activated genes were enriched on the X-chromosome , the C . elegans sex chromosome . 45% of the Notch-activated genes were X-linked , which is four-fold more than expected by chance ( p=2 . 99e-14; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . When analyzing only genes with higher than baseline germline expression values , the disproportional X-linkage of Notch-activated genes was even more striking ( fifteen times more than expected by chance ( p=2 , 19e-38; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . In the C . elegans germline , X-linked genes are largely silenced by the C . elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 . The C . elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2 , -3 , and -6 ( Bender et al . , 2004 ) and levels of the corresponding transcripts were essentially not altered by GLP-1Notch signaling ( mes-2: absolute fold change ( fc ) -1 . 3747; mes-3: fc 1 . 003; mes-6: fc 1 . 037 ) . To test for a functional relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we examined genetic interactions between GLP-1 and PRC2 mutants . At 20°C , both the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) and the homozygous loss-of-function mes-2 ( bn11 ) mutants , derived from heterozygous mothers providing maternal MES-2 ( mes-2 M+Z- mutants ) , were viable and produced gonads with nearly wild-type appearance . The double mes-2 M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , however , displayed distal and proximal tumors at the same temperature ( Figure 2B; 32/32 examined gonads ) . PRC2 and GLP-1Notch thus interact functionally , and they appear to do so in a germ cell autonomous manner ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome , and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1Notch , we speculated that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 act on similar genes . To determine whether Notch-activated genes are also PRC2-repressed , we first determined putative PRC2 targets by expression analyses on isolated wild-type , M+Z- mes-2 or mes-6 mutant gonads ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex , a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—source data 1; henceforth ‘PRC2 repressed’ genes; also see ( Gaydos et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes , particularly those linked to the X chromosome . Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 ( Figure 2C ) . This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1Notch signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes . This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 ( H3K27me3 ) , since , upon examining gonads of different GLP-1Notch mutants , we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . Germ cell conversion to neurons can be triggered not only by LIN-53 depletion but also by the depletion of PRC2 ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Potentially , the depletion of LIN-53 could facilitate reprograming by inhibiting PRC2 , since the depletion of LIN-53 results in a global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation , we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling . Indeed , GeCo was strongly enhanced in PRC2-depleted ( mes-2 , mes-3 or mes-6 RNAi ) animals , when they also carried the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele ( Figure 3A , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Moreover , similar to the LIN-53–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 1D ) , the loss of GLP-1 effectively prevented GeCo in PRC2–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 3B , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Together , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch stimulates GeCo in PRC2-compromised gonads . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 014Figure 3 . GLP-1Notch enhances reprograming upon the depletion of PRC2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 015 To determine how GLP-1Notch might counteract PRC2 , we depleted candidate Notch-activated genes ( Supplementary file 1 ) , and examined GeCo efficiency ( Figure 4A , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The strongest suppression of the GeCo+ and GeCo phenotype was observed upon the depletion of utx-1 , which also suppressed mes-3 RNAi-mediated GeCo+ in glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Depletion of two other candidates , the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the aldolase ortholog aldo-1 , also suppressed GeCo+ , albeit less efficiently ( Figure 4A ) . Because UTX-1 was suggested to effect gonadal development by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) , we re-examined GeCo efficiency upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) background . Importantly , in rrf-1 mutants , RNAi is impaired in the somatic gonad , including the distal tip cell ( DTC ) , which constitutes the germline stem cell niche ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . Because the suppression of GeCo+ upon utx-1 RNAi was observed also in the rrf-1 background , UTX-1 does not seem to enhance GeCo by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . Furthermore , different genetic backgrounds and RNAi agains utx-1 do not affect the expression levels of CHE-1 in the germline ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 016Figure 4 . The H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 is required for GeCo enhancement . ( A ) UTX-1 is critical for GeCo enhancement . Candidate Notch-activated genes , selected from Supplementary file 2 with available RNAi clones , were assayed for a role in GeCo in glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals , expressing CHE-1–induced nGFP and treated with lin-53 RNAi . While the additional depletion of utx-1 had the strongest impact on GeCo+ and GeCo , the depletion of C07G1 . 6 and aldo-1 had a weaker effect .

UTX-1 is required for the GeCo+ enhancement upon the depletion of PRC2 . ( A ) Adult glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals treated with lin-53 or mes-3 RNAi were additionally subjected to either control or utx-1 RNAi . Depletion of utx-1 strongly suppressed the GeCo+ phenotype .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 018 Importantly , utx-1 encodes a conserved H3K27me3 demethylase , an enzyme erasing the repressive mark deposited by PRC2 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Jin et al . , 2011; Maures et al . , 2011 ) , potentially explaining how its depletion impairs GeCo efficiency . However , a number of other H3K27me3 demethylases exist in C . elegans , which prompted us to test whether depletion of these demethylases might have an effect on GeCo in the glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads . We RNAi-depleted jmjd-1 . 2 , encoding a H3K9/27me2 demethylase ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , jmjd-3 . 1 , jmjd-3 . 2 , and jmjd-3 . 3 , which were reported to demethylate H3K27me2/3 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010; Zuryn et al . , 2014 ) , and , as a control , jmjd-2 , encoding a H3K9/36 demethylase ( Whetstine et al . , 2006; Greer et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . Only the depletion of JMJD-1 . 2 suppressed GeCo+ significantly , though to a lesser degree than the depletion of UTX-1 ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The suppression of GeCo by the depletion of UTX-1 or JMJD-1 . 2 stresses the importance of counteracting PRC2 in reprograming . However , only the expression of utx-1 is activated by the GLP-1Notch signaling , suggesting that it is the activity of UTX-1 which is key for the reprograming dependent on GLP-1Notch signaling . The inhibition of GeCo enhancement upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 background suggested that UTX-1 functions in the germline . To test the potential expression of utx-1 in the germline , we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated , FLAG and GFP-tagged , functional UTX-1 ( expressed from the endogenous utx-1 promoter under the control of endogenous utx-1 3'UTR ) . We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . To examine the potential transcriptional regulation of utx-1 expression by GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we also created a strain expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1 reporter ) , under the control of an unregulated ( tbb-2 ) 3’UTR . This construct was also single-copy integrated into a defined genomic location . With both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter , we expected expression patterns similar to that of other reported GLP-1Notch target genes ( Lamont et al . , 2004; Lee et al . , 2006; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Among these , lst-1 and sygl-1 account for the role of GLP-1Notch in stem cell maintenance , and both genes are expressed in the distal-most stem cells/progenitors ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . By contrast , both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most , proliferative part of the germline ( Figure 5A–C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Concomitantly with progression through meiosis , their expression increased toward the proximal end of the gonad ( Figure 5A–C ) . When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of Notch-activated and PRC2-repressed genes ( 33 genes ) , we noticed that half of these ( 18 , all X-linked ) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal , but not the distal-most , gonads ( Supplementary file 2 ) , arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1Notch in the wild type . Nevertheless , in agreement with the expression analyses , we observed increased expression of the putx-1 reporter in PRC2-depleted gonads; this increase occurred throughout the gonad , including the distal-most region ( Figure 5A ) . In situ hybridization for the endogenous utx-1 transcript also showed increased expression throughout the gonad in the absence of PRC2 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , expression of the putx-1 reporter was higher upon increased GLP-1Notch activity in glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , including the distal-most region where , in the wild type , utx-1 is little or not expressed ( Figure 5B ) . Importantly , we found that the activation of the utx-1 promoter by Notch signaling was depended on the putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites within the promoter ( Yoo et al . , 2004 ) , as deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately one-fourth ( Figure 5C ) . The interaction between LAG-1 and utx-1 was also tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) , performed on a strain expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 in either wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background ( Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) ; the previously identified GLP-1Notch targets , lst-1 and sygl-1 ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) , served as positive controls for the ChIP . Expectedly , we observed the enhanced binding of LAG-1 to the utx-1 promoter , indicating that utx-1 is a transcriptional target of GLP-1Notch signaling . Summarizing , based on the observations in mutant backgrounds , PRC2 and GLP-1Notch signaling have antagonistic effects on utx-1 transcription . However , in wild type , the endogenous levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression of utx-1 in the distal-most part of the gonad . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 019Figure 5 .

Top: dissected gonads expressing a GFP reporter , driven from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1::GFP , fused to histone 2B for nuclear localization to facilitate quantification ) , subjected to the indicated RNAi ( A ) , crossed into the indicated genetic background ( B ) or carrying the indicated mutations in the reporter gene ( C ) . a , b , and c indicate gonadal regions containing germ cells in mitosis ( a ) , and leptotene/zygotene ( b ) or pachytene ( c ) stages of meiosis . Below: the corresponding GFP quantifications . The diagrams show GFP intensities relative to the control ( indicated by green arrows ) in regions a-c . Results are represented as average changes in the GFP intensity ( relative to mock RNAi-ed or untreated animals ) . The error bars represent SEM . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for the LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . ( A ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is repressed by PRC2 . In all mes-depleted gonads , the reporter was de-repressed in proliferating cells ( a ) as well as in more proximal gonadal regions ( b-c ) . ( B ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is upregulated by GLP-1Notch . In the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutant , the reporter was strongly derepressed in the proliferating cells in the distal-most gonad ( a ) . Its expression was also increased in the more proximal regions ( b-c ) , which , in this mutant background , contain proliferating cells instead of meiotic cells . ( C ) putx-1::GFP expression depends on the predicted LAG-1/CSL binding sites in the promoter . Upon deletion of putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites , the reporter expression was abolished . The changes in GFP intensities were highly significant ( p-values were measured by independent t-tests ) p1=4 . 85–13 , p2=1 . 38–20 , p3=1 . 18–7 . ( D ) LAG-1 binds the utx-1 promoter . Lysates of animals expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 ( strain wgIs591; lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ) , either in wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background , were subjected to ChIP-qPCR analysis of the indicated genes . Negative controls and additional tested genes are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 . The qPCR amplicons were tested in at least three independent experiments . The results are shown as fold enrichment in anti-FLAG IP compared to IP with unspecific antibody . The 3’UTR of lst-1 serves as a negative control . Interestingly , LAG-1 binding in the glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function background is stronger to the utx-1 promoter than to the reported GLP-1Notch targets lst-1 and sygl-1 .

Worm lysates ( corresponding to 4 mg protein ) of animals , with or without lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ( wgIs591 ) transgene , were used for ChIP . Samples were incubated with 50 µl of FLAG ( ‘specific’ FLAG antibody ) or HA antibodies ( ‘unspecific’ HA antibody ) coupled to µMACS microbeads ( Milteny ) . As negative control , lysate N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) worm lysates , which do not express the recombinant target protein , were used . Both negative control lysates did not show any differences during the ChIP experiment when tested with either specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to µMACS beads ) or unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to µMACS beads ) . Lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein in N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background were incubated with specific ( anti-FLAG ) and unspecific ( anti-HA ) antibodies coupled to µMACS beads . The qPCR amplicons were tested in a minimum of three independent ChIP-qPCR experiments . Quantification results are shown as fold enrichment of anti-FLAG µMACS™ beads using wgIs591 lysate over anti-FLAG µMACS beads using lysate without wgIs591 ( no lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ) . Primer for qPCRs ( sequence details above ) were designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) . The FLAG-beads using lysates with lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG show specific enrichment for tested target genes thereby validating the specificity of the ChIP .

Here , we report an unexpected role of GLP-1Notch signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming . To understand this phenomenon , we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . While the identified genes include the physiological GLP-1Notch targets , sygl-1 and lst-1 , many other genes , including utx-1 , appear to be only weakly or not expressed in the distal-most region of the wild-type gonad , where both sygl-1 and lst-1 are induced by GLP-1Notch ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , the wild-type levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes ( see below ) , or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms , perhaps similarly to lip-1 mRNA , which , while induced by GLP-1Notch , is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad ( Hajnal and Berset , 2002; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to its major proliferation-promoting function , GLP-1Notch has been suggested to have a lesser role in promoting germ cell differentiation ( Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . Some of the identified Notch-activated genes appear to promote germ cell differentiation , potentially explaining the proposed differentiation-promoting function of GLP-1Notch . However , whether these genes are activated by GLP-1Notch and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined . Many of the Notch-activated genes are repressed by PRC2 , suggesting that the expression of these genes is determined by the crosstalk between the extrinsic intercellular signaling pathway , Notch , and the intrinsic chromatin modifier PRC2 . Indeed , at least in the case of utx-1 , PRC2 appears to prevent its inappropriate expression in the distal-most gonad , which , nevertheless , can be overcome upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . Our findings suggest that GLP-1Notch antagonizes PRC2 , at least in part , by stimulating expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 , which is essential for the enhancement of cellular reprograming . Previously , it was suggested that UTX-1 influences the germline by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . However , by using the rrf-1 background , which displays defective RNAi in the somatic gonad , including the DTC ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , we found that the reprograming-promoting role of UTX-1 is unlikely to depend on its function in the somatic gonad . Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue ( such as the intestine , in which RNAi remains functional in the rrf-1 mutant; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function . Consistent with this hypothesis , manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1Notch affected the germline expression of utx-1 . Although additional factors , such as the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the ortholog of the human aldolase A ( Kuwabara and O'Neil , 2001; Shaye and Greenwald , 2011 ) might contribute to reprograming , they appear to be less critical . In addition to UTX-1 , another H3K27/H3K9-demethylating enzyme , JMJD-1 . 2 ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , is required for enhanced reprograming . Similar to UTX-1 , JMJD-1 . 2 is likely to be directly involved in regulating chromatin accessibility , since its depletion results in increased levels of the repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 modifications ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) . The reprograming-promoting role of JMJD-1 . 2 might indicate that , besides further demethylation of H3K27me2 , perhaps also the removal of H3K9me2 facilitates GeCo . Future studies will shed light on this interesting question . UTX-1 orthologs in other species contribute to tissue-specific chromatin signatures , for example during myogenesis or in cardiac development ( Seenundun et al . , 2010; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , and have been implicated in germ-cell and somatic reprograming ( Mansour et al . , 2012 ) . Together with our data , these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming . Here , we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation . Interestingly , an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also been observed in T-cell leukemia ( Ntziachristos et al . , 2012 ) . A fascinating possibility is that a regulatory principle described here could help explain the etiology of this and perhaps other human diseases linked to a pathological increase in Notch signaling .\nStandard procedures were used to maintain animals . Worms ( RRID:WB_DL226 ) were grown at 25°C unless stated otherwise . All heat-shock and temperature-sensitive strains were kept at 15°C . The C . elegans lines used in this study are listed and described in detail in the Supplementary file 3A . The enhancer-suppressor screen on Notch targets was performed by feeding the animals with bacteria containing RNAi clones from the Ahringer and Vidal RNAi libraries . The clones not present in either of these libraries were cloned using primers as described in detail in the Supplementary file 3B . Experiments were performed at 15°C , 20°C or 25°C using bleached embryos or overnight-synchronized L1 animals as stated in Supplementary file 1 . The percentage of adult animals with the germline tumor phenotype was scored . To test germ-cell autonomy , RNAi clones that induced significant suppression or enhancement in either setting were re-tested in a strain carrying the glp-1 ( ar202 ) ( RRID:WB_GC833 ) allele and , additionally the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) ( RRID:WB_NL2098 ) mutation , which impairs RNAi primarily in the soma ( Sijen et al . , 2001 ) . For this test , gravid adults were picked to RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs overnight at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C . Progeny was scored for enhancement or suppression of the germline tumorous phenotype at the young adult stage by DAPI staining of dissected gonads and scoring gonads as either wild-type , as containing a proximal or distal tumor but still some eggs , or as completely tumorous . Reprograming experiments were carried out as F1-RNAi . Worms were put on RNAi plates and the following F1 generation was screened for phenotypes . Used RNAi clones are described in the Supplementary file 3B . The genotype of the worms used for germ cell reprograming assays is BAT28 ( otIs305 ntIs1 , RRID:WB_OH9846 , details in Supplemental Materials and methods ) . Animals were synchronized by bleaching and eggs were put on NGM-agar containing E . coli OP50 ( RRID:WB_OP50 ) as a food source to grow at 15°C until worms reached the L4-stage . At this stage 15–20 worms were put per well of a 6-well plate , containing bacteria expressing dsRNA or carrying an empty RNAi vector , and grown at 15°C until most of the F1 progeny reached the L3/L4 stage . The plates were heat-shocked at 37°C for 30 min followed by an overnight incubation at 25°C . Next day ( ~16 hrs post heat-shock ) the plates were screened for progeny showing ectopic GFP induction in the germline . To induce the Glp phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) , the animals were shifted to room temperature 9 hrs before the heat-shock . For double RNAi , bacteria were grown as saturated culture . The OD600 was measured to ensure that the bacteria were mixed in an appropriate 1:1 ratio and subsequently seeded on RNAi 6-well plates . The RNAi screen was performed as described above . The p-values were calculated using Student's t-test . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment was carried out as previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . HU was added to seeded RNAi-plates at a final concentration of 250 µM . L4 worms ( strain BAT32 , details in Supplementary file 3A ) grown on RNAi-plates were transferred to HU plates and incubated at room temperature for 5 hrs prior to heat-shock in order to induce CHE-1 expression . To test HU efficiency , control animals were treated with HU for 12 hrs with subsequent staining for DAPI and H3Ser10ph ( pH3 ) antibody ( Abcam #ab5176 ) . After overnight incubation , the worms were assessed for GFP induction in the germline as described above . To assess the efficiency of the HU treatment , the E . coli strain MG1693 ( E . coli stock center ) , with incorporated 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) , was used to feed L3/L4 worms . EdU in combination with DAPI staining was performed similar to the procedure described previously ( Ito and McGhee , 1987 ) and according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Invitrogen , Europe ) of the EdU labeling kit . The Click-iT EdU reaction buffer ( Invitrogen , Europe ) was mixed with Alexa Fluor azide ( ‘click’ reaction ) dye to detect cells that were replicating DNA . Staining was performed by freeze cracking worms after fixation with 2% formaldehyde . Parental animals were raised at 15°C and shifted to 25°C for egg laying . Offspring was dissected after the L4-adult transition . Fifty gonads per analyzed genotype in triplicates were dissected in M9 containing levamisole . RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Total RNA ( 200 ng for the Notch ON/OFF experiments or 100 ng for the mes/wild-type experiments ) was amplified using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Amplified Double Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Affymetrix GeneChip WT Double-Stranded cDNA Terminal Labeling Kit was used for the fragmentation and labeling of 7 . 5 μg cDNA . The labeled material was loaded onto Affymetrix GeneChip C . elegans Tiling 1 . 0R Arrays and hybridized at 65ºC for 16 hrs . The arrays were washed in an Affymetrix Fluidics station with the protocol FS450_0001 and scanned in an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 with autoloader using Affymetrix GCC Scan Control v . 3 . 0 . 0 . 1214 software . All tiling arrays were processed in R ( 32 , 33 ) using Bioconductor ( 34 ) and the packages tilingArray and preprocessCore . The arrays were RMA background corrected and log2 transformed on the oligo level using the following command: expr <- log2 ( rma . background . correct ( exprs ( readCel2eSet ( filenames , rotated = TRUE ) ) ) ) . We mapped the oligos from the tiling array ( bpmap file from www . affymetrix . com ) to the C . elegans genome assembly ce6 ( www . genome . ucsc . edu ) using bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) , allowing no error and unique mapping position . Expressions for individual transcripts were calculated by intersecting the genomic positions of the oligos with transcript annotation ( WormBase WS190 ) and averaging the intensity of the respective oligos . For the mes-4/wt experiment , no quantile normalization was performed as the distributions for the mes-4 mutant and the wt differed substantially . In the case of the Notch ON/OFF dataset quantile normalization was performed on the level of transcripts . The p-values were calculated in R with the hypergeometric distribution function 'phyper' . RNA was isolated as described above . cDNA was synthesized with oligo dT primer using the ImProm II Reverse Transcription System from Promega according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was used for qPCR with the Absolute QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix ( AbGene ) on an ABI PRISM 7700 system ( Applied Biosystems ) . qPCR reactions were performed as described previously ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . At least one primer in each pair is specific for an exon-exon junction . Sequences of the used primers are described in detail in the Supplementary file 3C . Mouse RNA was added before RNA isolation and reverse transcription , allowing for normalization to cyt-c and thereby correcting for variations in RNA isolation and reverse transcription . Standard curves for quantification were generated from a serial dilution of input cDNA for each primer pair . The amount of target present in each replicate was derived from the standard curve; an average was calculated for each of the triplicates . To compare total mRNA levels , the qPCR results were normalized to mouse cyt-c and to the C . elegans tubulin gene tbb-2 , and fold enrichments were calculated . RNA in situ hybridization was performed and analyzed as previously described ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . Description of the primer pairs to generate probes from cDNA can be found in the Supplementary file 3C . Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope , equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera . Images were taken in linear mode of the Axiovision software ( Zeiss ) and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . ChIP was performed as described ( Askjaer et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , worms ( strains OP591 , RRID:WB_OP591 , and BAT890 ) were washed with M9 buffer and frozen as ‘worm popcorn’ in liquid nitrogen prior to pulverization with a mortar and pestle . The powder was dissolved in 10 volumes of 1 , 1% formaldehyde in PBS + 1 mM PMSF and incubated 10 mins with gentle rocking at room temperature with subsequent quenching for 5 mins at room temperature by adding 2 , 5 molar glycine ( final concentration 125 mM ) . After centrifugation with 4 . 000 g at 4°C the pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS+1 mM PMSF and resuspended in 50 mM FA buffer ( 50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7 , 5; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton-X 100; 0 , 1% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl ) + 1% sarkosyl + protease-inhibitors . Samples were sonicated twice using the Biorupter ( 15 times 30 s ON , 30 s OFF ) on high settings at 4°C followed by spinning at 13 . 000 g , 15 min , 4°C . The supernatant corresponding to 4 mg of protein measured by Bradford assay was used for ChIPs . Samples were incubated with 50 µl of FLAG or HA antibodies coupled to µMACS microbeads ( Milteny ) ( all blocked with 5% milk in FA-buffer ) . After incubating 1 hr at 4°C , the beads where washed in µMACS matrix columns in a magnetic rack with FA buffer containing 1 M and 0 . 5 M NaCl and subsequent wash with TE and TEL buffer ( 0 , 25 M LiCl; 1% Sodium deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM Tris pH 8 , 0 ) . Bound material was eluted with 65°C pre-warmed 125 µl ChIP elution buffer ( 1% SDS , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA ) and fixation was reversed using 2 µl of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K at at 50°C for 1 hr followed by 65°C incubation overnight . DNA was purified using the Quiaquick PCR purification kit in a final volume of 40 µl and 1 µl was used for qPCR . Negative controls were used to assess the quality of the ChIP and fold enrichment of the target genes: lysates ( N2 worms ) which do not express the recombinant target protein with specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to µMACS beads ) and lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein with unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to µMACS beads ) controls , respectively . Primer for qPCRs was designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) with the following settings: amplified region min . 100 bp – max . 200 bp; GC content: 50–60%; min . primer length: 18 nt – max . length 24 nt; melting temperature: min . 58°C – max . 63°C; max . ; 3' self complementary allowance set to 1; max . allowed length of a mononucleotide repeat ( max . poly-x ) : 3 . Sequences of the used primers are listed in in the Supplementary file 3C . The qPCRs were run on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System from BioRad using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix ( 2X ) . The data analysis was performed by calculating the ΔΔCt-values . Differences were assessed using Student's t-test . Worms were transferred to a slide and fixed by adding 10–20 µl 95% ethanol and letting evaporate the ethanol . The ethanol fixation was repeated 2 more times before adding the DAPI solution in microscopy mounting media ( vectashield from Vector or similar ) . The samples were sealed with a coverslip and nail polish before microscopy . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and the SensicamII camera ( PCO ) and the micromanager software was used to capture Z-stack images with 0 . 5 µm slice steps . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times . Counting of germ cells within the range from the DTC to the turn of gonadal arms of glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; hsp::che-1; gcy-5::gfp animals treated with either mock or lin-53 RNAi was performed using the Z-stacks . Micromanager was used to control the Z-stack levels and the ImageJ plugin for cell counting for scoring the number of germ cells . Germ cell counts in gonads of Notch ON: gld-2 ( q497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) and Notch OFF: gld-2 ( a497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( e2144 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) and germline tumor phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) and glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) were scored after dissection , formaldehyde fixation and DAPI staining . For Notch ON and Notch OFF mutants , the central plane of the gonads was imaged and germ cells in the entire dissected gonad were counted using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ . For each of the two strains , germ cells in the entire gonad of 15 dissected gonads were counted . Antibody stainings of intact worms were performed using a freeze-crack procedure as described ( Duerr , 2006 ) . In brief , after washing , worms were resuspended in 0 . 025% glutaraldehyde , and frozen between two frost-resistant glass slides on dry ice . Separating the glass slides while frozen creates additional cracks in the cuticle . Acetone/methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer for 1 hr on ice fixation was used . Worms were washed off the slides in PBS , blocked with 0 . 2% gelatin + 0 . 25% Triton in PBS , and stained . Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0 . 1% gelatin and 0 . 25% Triton and fixed worms were incubated 4 hrs - overnight at 4°C . After PBS washes secondary antibody was applied for 3 hrs . After PBS washes worms were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium ( Dianova , #CR-38448 ) on glass slides . The primary antibodies used were anti-H3K27me3 ( 1:400; gift from Dr . Hiroshi Kimura ) ; anti-HA ( 1:100 , Roche #12CA5; acetone fixation ) ; anti-H3Ser10ph ( 1:400 , Abcam , #ab14955; acetone fixation ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor dyes applied at 1:1000 dilution . Stainings for H3K27me3 on dissected gonads were performed using anti-H3K27me3 from Millipore ( catalogue number 07–449 , Lot 1959680; courtesy of Jan Padeken , Gasser laboratory ) on dissected gonads . The adult animals were dissected in M9 containing levamisole , fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS on poly-lysine coated slides , snap-frozen on dry ice , freeze-cracked , incubated for 5 mins in ice-cold DMF at −20° , washed for 5 mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature , blocked for 20 mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 + 5% BSA and incubated with the primary antibody over night at 4°C . Secondary antibodies ( Alexa 488 , goat anti rabbit , 1:500 ) were applied for 2 hrs at room temperature . Slides were then washed three times for 5 mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI . The transcriptional reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 ) was constructed from the 1302 bp putative promoter region of the gene utx-1 ( human UTX ( Ubiquitously transcribed TPR on X ) homolog - 1 ) fused to sequences encoding for GFP-H2B and the ubiquitously expressed tbb-2 3’UTR using the Gateway Reporter Cloning System ( Merritt et al . , 2008 ) . The reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 and rrrSi281 ) was constructed with the following primers: putx-attB4: GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGGGATTTTATCTTCATCGGACCTG putx-attB1 : GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGGCGGTGTGAGAAGCGATAC The full-length functional transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-utx-1::utx-1 3’UTR ( rrrSi189 ) was constructed with the following primers: utx-1+3UTR+attB2 L ggggacagctttcttgtacaaagtggACGACGAATCAGAACCTCTGCCGGAGGAGCGTCATgtaag utx-1+3UTR+attB3 R ggggacaactttgtataataaagttgaatgcggatactgccttctc The functional UTX-1 transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-tev::utx-1::utx-1 3’utr ( rrrSi189 ) contains the same promoter as the transcriptional reporter , the full-length utx-1 genomic sequence as well as the endogenous 3’UTR , and was equipped with N-terminal GFP , FLAG , and TEV tags . Transgenic animals were produced as single-copy integrants using the MosSCI direct insertion protocol ( Frøkjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . The rrrSi189 transgene is functional , as it rescues the utx-1 mutant ( ok3553 allele ) . For GFP quantification , gonads were dissected from live animals in M9 buffer containing levamisole and mounted to glass microscopy slides ( Frøkjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and a Zeiss Axioncam MRm REV 2 CCD camera was used to capture images . Fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ . GFP intensities were normalized to the picture background and corrected with the average autofluorescences measured in wild type ( N2 ) gonads at the corresponding temperatures . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times and were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( gf ts ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . Alleles used were glp-1 ( ar202 ) and mes-2 ( bn11 ) . Worms were grown at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C and gonads were dissected and DAPI-stained shortly after the L4-young adult transition . The experiment was performed twice . In a first round , a low number of gonads were examined to identify whether the double mutant had a phenotype and to define phenotypic categories to score . Based on the observation of a clear and penetrant phenotype , gonads were scored in a second round according to the categories defined in the first round .",
         "The DNA in genes encodes the basic information needed to build an organism or control its day-to-day operations . Most cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , but different types of cell use the information differently . For example , many of the genes that are active in a muscle cell are different from those that are active in a skin cell . These different patterns of gene activation largely determine a cell’s identity and are brought about by DNA-binding proteins or chemical modifications to the DNA ( which are both forms of so-called epigenetic regulation ) . Nevertheless , cells occasionally change their identities – a phenomenon that is referred to as reprograming . This process allows tissues to be regenerated after wounding , but , due to technical difficulties , reprograming has been often studied in isolated cells grown in a dish . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . set out to understand how being surrounded by intact tissue influences reprograming . The experiments made use of C . elegans worms , because disturbing how this worm’s DNA is packaged can trigger its cells to undergo reprograming . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . show that a signaling pathway that is found in many different animals enhances this kind of reprograming in C . elegans . On the one hand , these findings help in understanding how epigenetic regulation can be altered by a specific tissue environment . On the other hand , the findings also suggest that abnormal signaling can result in altered epigenetic control of gene expression and lead to cells changing their identity . Indeed , increased signaling is linked to a major epigenetic mechanism seen in specific blood tumors , suggesting that the regulatory principles uncovered using this simple worm model could eventually provide insights into a human disease . A future challenge will be to determine precisely how the studied signaling pathway interacts with the epigenetic regulator that controls reprograming . Understanding this interaction in molecular detail could help to devise strategies for controlling reprograming . These strategies could in turn lead to treatments for people with conditions that cause specific cells types to be lost , such as Alzheimer’s disease or injuries .",

         "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a respiratory , blood , liver , and bladder pathogen of significant clinical concern . We show that the adaptor protein , SKAP2 , is required for protection against K . pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections . Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells . Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs , and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K . pneumoniae infection in mice; however , K . pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in vitro was abolished . K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC . The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K . pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways . In conclusion , SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection .\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that can cause a wide range of life-threatening infections , including pneumonia , sepsis and urinary tract infections ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . K . pneumoniae is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections with one recent study reporting that K . pneumoniae contributes to 7 . 7% of cases from over 4500 hospitals ( Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . The increasing number of severe , and sometimes systemic , K . pneumoniae infections are largely attributed to a rise in antibiotic-resistant strains ( Falagas et al . , 2014; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) and hypervirulent strains that generate thicker capsules ( Zhang et al . , 2016; Harada et al . , 2019; Lam et al . , 2018 ) . Highlighting the importance of the innate immune response , neutropenic patients are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and bloodstream infections , including those caused by K . pneumoniae ( Zhu et al . , 2018; Micozzi et al . , 2017 ) . K . pneumoniae lung pathogenesis has been extensively investigated in a mouse model using the rodent-adapted ATCC 43816 ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Bachman et al . , 2015; Vornhagen et al . , 2019; Batra et al . , 2012 ) . In murine models of infection , the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain robustly infects lungs eliciting a strong innate immune response through rapid and concurrent recruitment of neutrophils and iMOs to the infected lungs ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Cai et al . , 2010; Batra et al . , 2012; Sharma et al . , 2014; Ye et al . , 2001 ) . Work using this strain has revealed several genes that protect K . pneumoniae against the host neutrophil response ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Neutrophils are the first responder cell type for fighting against invading pathogens , however , their activation is tightly regulated to prevent severe tissue damage that have been correlated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases ( Mócsai , 2013 ) . At the site of infection , neutrophils can bind to pathogens leading to the activation of various killing mechanisms , including phagocytosis , generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , degranulation , and release of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) ( Futosi et al . , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017; Mócsai , 2013 ) . Although the K . pneumoniae capsule decreases bacterial binding and internalization ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , ROS , degranulation , NETs , and cytokine production have all been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Chen et al . , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Ivin et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . The importance of ROS in host protection is highlighted in the setting of Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) , a disease characterized by genetic mutations in the NADPH oxidase , where patients are unable to make ROS and are susceptible to Klebsiella infections ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Bortoletto et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , mice with defective ROS production ( Cybb-/- ) have a higher bacterial burden than wild-type mice during K . pneumoniae lung infection ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . Receptor-mediated ROS production in neutrophils is driven by signal-transduction pathways that activate components of the NADPH oxidase complex ( Nguyen et al . , 2017; Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . These signaling pathways are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activation and subsequent tissue damage ( Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . Work in mice suggests that signaling through integrin , mincle receptors , G-protein couple receptors ( GPCRs ) and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are critical for protection against K . pneumoniae infection ( Teng et al . , 2016; Sharma et al . , 2014; Sharma et al . , 2017; Regueiro et al . , 2006; Galvão et al . , 2018; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . In fact , multiple receptors may sense and/or bind to K . pneumoniae triggering ROS production . Prior studies have indicated a critical role for Src Kinase Associated Phosphoprotein-2 , SKAP2 ( SKAP-Hom and SKAP-55R ) downstream of integrin , and GPCRs in neutrophils and macrophages ( Boras et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Mócsai et al . , 2002; Togni et al . , 2005 ) . SKAP2 , a cytosolic adaptor protein , is required for integrin-mediated ROS production , adhesion , and migration to sterile inflammatory sites through its interaction with mediators of actin rearrangement ( Alenghat et al . , 2012; Boras et al . , 2017; Shimamura et al . , 2013; Tanaka et al . , 2016 ) . SKAP2 is also a target for inactivation by bacterial virulence factors , suggesting that it plays a key role in host defenses against infections ( Black et al . , 2000; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) . In humans , the Skap2 gene has been identified as a risk locus for Type 1 Diabetes , and Crohn’s disease ( Jostins et al . , 2012; Barrett et al . , 2009 ) . In resting cells , SKAP2 is thought to exist in an autoinhibitory conformation as a homodimer that is constitutively bound to PRAM-1 in neutrophils ( Moog-Lutz et al . , 2001; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) , or its homolog , ADAP , in other immune cells ( Liu et al . , 1998; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Black et al . , 2000; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Upon receptor activation , SKAP2 changes to an active conformation that is localized to the plasma membrane , which allows it to interact other effector proteins including Src Family Kinases ( SFKs ) ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Liu et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , activated SKAP proteins can relay information from receptors to focal adhesion kinases ( FAK1/Pyk2 ) to other cytoskeletal mediators ( Ménasché et al . , 2007; Boras et al . , 2017; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Raab et al . , 2017; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Using a murine model of K . pneumoniae 43816 infection , we characterized the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense against K . pneumoniae in this study . We demonstrate that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contributed to the pulmonary containment of K . pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes . Using murine neutrophils , we show that K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production requires SKAP2 , SFKs , Syk , PLCγ , Btk , and PKC , and that SKAP2 is required for maximal K . pneumoniae-activated phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 .\nTo examine the role of SKAP2 in the pathogenesis of pneumonic K . pneumoniae infection , we intranasally infected wild-type ( WT ) BALB/c or BALB/c Skap2-/- mice with a streptomycin-resistant derivative of K . pneumoniae 43816 , a hyper-capsule producer that belongs to one of the most common hypervirulent serotype , K2 ( Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Previous studies using K . pneumoniae 43816 or a derivative of this strain have reported a 50% lethal dose at 48 hr after infection with 3−5 × 103 colony forming units ( cfu ) in BALB/c mice , and a robust infection with high bacterial burden and cellular infiltration in the lungs by 24 hr with mice developing disseminated infection by 48 hr in C57BL/6J ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Ye et al . , 2001; Feldman et al . , 2019 ) . WT and Skap2-/- mice were infected with 5 × 103 cfu and were monitored for weight loss , bacterial colonization , and innate cell recruitment at 8 , 16 , and 24 hr post infection ( hpi ) ( Figure 1A–C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , E–J ) . Consistent with prior studies , by 24 hr , infected WT mice lost 2% of their body weight , and K . pneumoniae reached on average 106 cfu with a 5-fold increase in neutrophil presence in the infected lungs ( Figure 1A–C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . However , Skap2-/- mice lost significantly more body weight than the WT cohort at 24 hpi ( Figure 1A ) and had significantly higher bacterial loads in their lungs at 16 and 24 hpi ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that Skap2-/- mice are less competent at controlling K . pneumoniae infection . The increase in bacterial burden did not appear to be due to differences in the numbers of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6Ghi ) because neutrophils were detected at comparable levels in WT and Skap2-/- lungs , bone marrow as well as bronchoalveolar lavage of infected mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D ) . In addition , there was no difference in alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) , or dendritic cells ( CD11bhi CD11chi ) in the lungs of K . pneumoniae-infected WT and Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–J ) . Histological examination showed extensive leukocyte infiltration in both the WT and Skap2-/- infected lungs supporting the flow cytometry data ( Figure 1D–L , black arrows ) . This interstitial infiltration inflammatory cells can be seen in the early stages of infection prior to bronchopneumonia ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , some infected Skap2-/- lungs ( 2/5 lungs ) had lesions with cellular destruction and uncontrolled bacterial growth surrounded by sparse leukocyte infiltration ( Figure 1K–L , blue arrows ) . To evaluate whether SKAP2-dependent control of K . pneumoniae colonization was required in a different mouse background , C57BL/6J , C57BL/6J Skap2-/- , or heterozygous littermates were inoculated retropharyngeally with K . pneumoniae ( Figure 1M–N; Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–N ) . At 24 hpi , C57BL/6 Skap2-/- mice had a significant increase in bacterial burden compared to C57BL/6 and heterozygous littermates ( Figure 1M ) . In general , comparable numbers of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were detected in all three strains ( Figure 1N; Figure 1—figure supplement 1L–N ) although the percent of neutrophils recovered in C57Bl/6 Skap2-/- mice was higher ( Figure 1N ) In summary , although leukocytes are present in the Skap2-/- lungs at comparable or slightly higher level to wild-type lungs , Skap2-/- mice were more susceptible to K . pneumoniae infection suggesting that their antimicrobial functions are compromised . To investigate whether Skap2 expression in bone marrow-derived leukocytes was required for controlling the antibacterial response to K . pneumoniae infection , we generated bone marrow ( BM ) chimeric mice by transplanting WT or Skap2-/- BM cells into either WT or Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 2A ) . Transplantation efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . WT recipient mice reconstituted with Skap2-/- BM had significantly more K . pneumoniae in contrast to WT mice transplanted with WT BM ( Figure 2B ) . Conversely , Skap2-/- recipients with WT BM cells had significantly decreased K . pneumoniae in their lungs as compared to Skap2-/- hosts that received Skap2-/- BM cells ( Figure 2B ) . The differences in bacterial burdens were not due to differences in numbers of neutrophils as equivalent numbers were recovered among all four groups of mice ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E ) . While fewer inflammatory monocytes ( iMOs ) were detected in Skap2-/- recipients regardless of BM cell donor , the difference did not correlate with bacterial load ( Figure 2B , D; Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–H ) . Combined , these data indicate Skap2 expression in BM-derived immune cells is required to contain K . pneumoniae growth during lung infection , and that Skap2 expression in cells that are not derived from the marrow do not contribute to this phenotype . The contribution of neutrophils and iMOs to host defense against K . pneumoniae infection is dependent on the bacterial strain used with K . pneumoniae ATCC 43816 being more susceptible to neutrophils ( Xiong et al . , 2015; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . To determine the role of neutrophils and iMOs in the increased susceptibility of Skap2-/- mice to K . pneumoniae , WT and Skap2-/- mice were treated with the α-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) to deplete neutrophils , or the MC-21 antibody , which targets CCR2+ cells to deplete iMOs ( Figure 2E ) . Depletion efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–F ) . While the K . pneumoniae burden in iMOs-depleted WT mice was similar to vehicle-treated mice , significantly more bacteria were recovered from the lungs of neutrophil-depleted WT mice ( Figure 2E ) confirming the importance of neutrophils in host defense ( Ye et al . , 2001; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . The neutrophil-depleted WT mice had similarly high bacterial burdens as Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 2E ) , and the depletion of Skap2-/- mice of neutrophils or iMOs did not increase their bacterial burden suggesting that protection against K . pneumoniae infection is SKAP2-dependent ( Figure 2E ) . To assess the contribution of Skap2 expression in BM-derived iMOs and neutrophils in limiting K . pneumoniae infection , iMOs and neutrophils were depleted from irradiated Skap2-/- mice that had been reconstituted with WT BM cells ( Figure 2F ) . Depletion efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2G–J ) . As expected , reconstitution of Skap2-/- mice with WT BM resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial burden compared to Skap2-/- mice that received Skap2-/- BM cells ( Figure 2F ) . Skap2-/- mice that received WT BM and were then depleted of neutrophils with α-Ly6G showed an increase in bacterial load and that burden was similar to those in Skap2-/- mice that received Skap2-/- neutrophils ( Figure 2F ) . By contrast , α-CCR2-treated mice had a similar bacterial burden as PBS-treated mice ( Figure 2F ) . Together , these data indicate that neutrophils cannot control K . pneumoniae 43816 infection in the absence of SKAP2 in the hematopoietic compartment . As Skap2-/- neutrophils are present in infected tissues ( Figure 1D , J , N; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D ) , the uncontrolled K . pneumoniae growth may occur because of defects in the antimicrobial functions of Skap2-/- neutrophils at the site of infection . Neutrophils have multiple antimicrobial mechanisms to limit bacterial growth during infection ( Futosi et al . , 2013; Mócsai , 2013 ) . To investigate which antimicrobial functions are controlled by SKAP2 , the ER-Hoxb8 conditionally-immortalized stem cell system was adopted as a tool to produce a supply of neutrophils ( Wang et al . , 2006; Chu et al . , 2019 ) . Mouse BM-derived stem cells from WT and Skap2-/- mice were retrovirally transduced with Hoxb8 regulated by estrogen ( ER-Hoxb8 ) , and maintained in media containing estrogen ( E2 ) and stem cell factor ( SCF ) to expand granulocyte-monocyte progenitors ( GMP ) in vitro ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–I and see Materials and Methods ) . Removal of E2 inactivates Hoxb8 expression and the addition of interleukin-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor led to terminal neutrophil differentiation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–I ) . Neutrophil maturation from WT and Skap2-/- ER-HoxB8-immortalized GMP cells ( Hoxb8 GMP ) was evaluated by nuclear morphology ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) and cell surface expression of cKit , CD11b and Ly6G ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D , G–I ) . Hoxb8 GMP cells were mononuclear and cKit+ CD11b- Ly6G- ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D , G–I ) . Cells from both mouse lines differentiated by day 4 and were comparably viable ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F ) . Fully differentiated cells are referred to as differentiated in vitro ( DIV ) neutrophils . Like BM-derived neutrophils , DIV neutrophils expressed polymorphonuclear morphology and are cKit- CD11b+ Ly6G+ ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D , G–I ) . To confirm the functionality of DIV neutrophils in comparison to BM neutrophils , their ability to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) following integrin and Fcγ receptor stimulation was assessed ( Chu et al . , 2019 ) . When plated onto surfaces coated with poly-RGD , an engineered polypeptide containing multiple copies of the integrin binding motif , WT BM and DIV neutrophils released superoxide , while Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils did not ( Figure 3A–C ) . This is consistent with previously published data in C57BL/6J and Skap2-/- BM neutrophils ( Boras et al . , 2017 ) . The loss in integrin-mediated ROS production was not due to defects in the NADPH oxidase itself , as Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils robustly released ROS when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , which bypasses receptor-mediated signaling pathways and activates NADPH oxidase via protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Dang et al . , 2001; Figure 3C ) . By contrast , after stimulation of Fcγ receptors by IgG immune complexes ( IC ) , WT and Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils robustly produced ROS ( Figure 3D–F ) . Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils consistently released 60–80% as much ROS as compared to levels seen in comparable WT neutrophils . This indicates IC-stimulated ROS is partially dependent on SKAP2 . Differences in ROS production were not due to differences in surface marker expression levels as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils expressed similar levels of integrin and Fcγ receptors as measured by CD11b and CD16 expression , respectively , by flow cytometry ( Figure 3G–J ) . Combined , these results indicate WT and Skap2-/- DIVs phenocopy primary BM neutrophils both morphologically and functionally and are a useful tool to investigate how SKAP2 modulates K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil responses . Furthermore , these data suggest that a functional NADPH complex can assemble in Skap2-/- neutrophils and that SKAP2 is required for receptor-activated signaling pathways downstream of integrin receptors , but not Fcγ receptors . Multiple neutrophil antimicrobial mechanisms , including degranulation , phagocytosis , and NETs , have been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae infection ( Chen et al . , 2016; Ivin et al . , 2017; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) . To examine whether Skap2-/- neutrophils degranulated as efficiently as WT neutrophils during K . pneumoniae infection , we measured levels of released MMP-9 and neutrophil elastase ( ELA2 ) , proteins found in tertiary and primary granules , respectively ( Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Sheshachalam et al . , 2014 ) . Supernatants from WT and Skap2-/- K . pneumoniae-infected lungs had equivalent levels of MMP-9 and ELA2 in Skap2-/- at 16 and 24 hpi as detected by ELISA ( Figure 4A–B ) . This suggests that the increased in susceptibility of Skap2-/- mice was not due to defects in degranulation . To determine the role of SKAP2 in phagocytosis of K . pneumoniae , phagocytosis was initially measured using microscopy . However , microscopic examination of WT DIV neutrophils infected with GFP-labeled K . pneumoniae and counterstained with Alexa594-conjugated polyvalent α-K . pneumoniae for extracellular bacteria did not reveal any internalized bacteria indicating that phagocytosis levels were less than 1% ( unpublished data ) . Using a more sensitive gentamicin protection assay ( Walker et al . , 2019 ) , K . pneumoniae 43816 was recovered on average at less than 0 . 01% in WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils , while a non-encapsulated ( ΔcpsB ) K . pneumoniae strain was recovered at approximately 0 . 05% ( Figure 4C ) . This low level was not due to a defect in phagocytosis of DIV neutrophils as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils were able to phagocytose Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII ΔyscNU strain , a strain that is susceptible to phagocytosis ( Balada-Llasat and Mecsas , 2006 ) . WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils phagocytosed 20% and 10% of ΔyscNU , respectively ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that phagocytosis of this Y . pseudotuberculosis strain is partially dependent on SKAP2 . Although we observed low level of phagocytosis of K . pneumoniae 43816 , the SKAP2-mediated defect in phagocytosis might be more prominent when challenged with other K . pneumoniae isolates . Combined , these results indicate that the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression , but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection . ROS is an important mechanism for protection against K . pneumoniae as mice that lack the essential gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase , Cybb-/- , were significantly more susceptible to K . pneumoniae infection and had a significant increase in bacterial burden in their lungs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . To test whether SKAP2 deficiency resulted in a defect in neutrophil ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection , an isoluminol-amplified chemiluminiscence assay was used . In contrast to WT BM and DIV neutrophils , neither Skap2-/- BM nor DIV neutrophils produced ROS following exposure to K . pneumoniae ( Figure 5A–B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C ) . The loss of K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production was not due to a defect in bacterial-binding as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils bound GFP-labeled K . pneumoniae equivalently when assessed by flow cytometry following both 15- and 30 min incubations ( Figure 5C ) . Without treating the cells with actin inhibitor , such as cytochalasin B , bound and phagocytosed bacteria could contribute to the levels of GFP+ cells . However , the less than 1% of internalization of K . pneumoniae observed in the gentamicin protection assay ( Figure 4C ) suggests that the majority of the bacteria are extracellular , and that GFP+ cells are more likely reflective of binding . Finally , SKAP2 was important for ROS production after infection with another gram-negative bacterial strain , a type 3 deficient Y . pseudotuberculosis strain , ΔyscF ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ) . In summary , Skap2-/- neutrophils are defective in triggering the signaling cascade ( s ) required for ROS after K . pneumoniae binding to surface receptors . To investigate how SKAP2 mediates K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production , we first evaluated the requirement for several well-established proteins that are critical for receptor-mediated ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection . Src family kinases ( SFKs ) , Spleen Associated Tyrosine Kinase ( Syk ) , Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , Phospholipase Cγ2 ( PLCγ2 ) , and PKC play critical roles in receptor-mediated ROS production ( Löfgren et al . , 1999; Braselmann et al . , 2006; Volmering et al . , 2016; Dang et al . , 2001; Raad et al . , 2009; Kovács et al . , 2014; Fumagalli et al . , 2007; Graham et al . , 2007; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) . To determine whether these proteins are required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , WT DIV neutrophils were pretreated with PP2 , R406 , Ibrutinib , U-73122 , and Go6983 , which are small molecules that inhibit the functions of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC ( both novel and conventional isoforms ) , respectively ( Figure 5D; Peterman et al . , 2004; Braselmann et al . , 2006; Rolán et al . , 2013; Prezzo et al . , 2019; Fumagalli et al . , 2007 ) . The DIV neutrophils were then infected with K . pneumoniae . Pretreatment with PP2 , R406 , Ibrutinib , U-73122 , and Go6983 abolished ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection compared to vehicle-pretreated neutrophils ( Figure 5E ) . As expected , only pretreatment with Go6983 blocked ROS after PMA exposure . U73433 , an U73122 analog that does not target PLCγ , did not block K . pneumoniae- and PMA-induced ROS ( Figure 5E; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) . This suggests SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC are each necessary for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production . Next , we assessed whether SKAP2 mediates K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production by influencing tyrosine phosphorylated-dependent functions of SFKs and Syk . To determine whether SFKs and Syk are phosphorylated in response to K . pneumoniae infection , western blots of lysates from K . pneumoniae-infected WT DIV neutrophils were probed with phospho-specific antibodies . Infection with K . pneumoniae induced phosphorylation of SFKs ( pSFK ) and Syk ( pSFK ) to levels 2–5-fold higher than in unstimulated neutrophils ( Figure 5F–I; Supplementary file 1 ) . These results support findings with inhibitors showing that SFKs and Syk functions are required for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS ( Figure 5E ) . In addition , proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( Pyk2 ) , which is a tyrosine kinase that functions downstream of SFKs and Syk to mediate ROS production ( Kamen et al . , 2011; Zhao and Bokoch , 2005 ) , was phosphorylated in response to K . pneumoniae stimulation ( Figure 5K–L; Supplementary file 1 ) . Thus , signaling circuit ( s ) containing SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 were activated in neutrophils following receptor binding of K . pneumoniae . To determine if SKAP2 is required for phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases , the levels of pSFKs , pSyk , and pPyk2 were assessed in Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils following K . pneumoniae exposure . While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 phosphorylation were all slightly induced in Skap2-/- neutrophils , the level of induction was often significantly reduced as compared to WT neutrophils ( Figure 5F–L; Supplementary file 1 ) . To determine if the reduction in phosphorylation was due to decreased cell viability , Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils were also stimulated with IC as a control . Stimulation of FcγRs resulted in the phosphorylation for SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 to similar levels in both WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils ( Figure 5F , H , K and Supplementary file 1 ) . Collectively , these results show that SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 are required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , and that the loss of SKAP2 prevents full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 after K . pneumoniae stimulation such that neutrophils are unable to generate ROS production .\nOur experiments reveal that SKAP2 plays a key role in host defense in the hematopoietic compartment against K . pneumoniae 43816 in pulmonary infections in a murine lung model of infection . SKAP2 was indispensable for K . pneumoniae-stimulated neutrophil ROS production , but not degranulation or phagocytosis , suggesting that the increased bacterial burden in the Skap2-/- mice is affected by the loss of ROS . Sensitivity of K . pneumoniae to ROS is strongly supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice during lung infection , and observations in CGD patients ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . In murine neutrophils , SKAP2 was required for full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 , demonstrating a critical role in K . pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways that are required for ROS production . Consistent with previous findings ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , K . pneumoniae 43816 was resistant to internalization indicating that phagocytosis is most likely not the primary protective mechanism provided by neutrophils to this strain . Prior studies , including one using K . pneumoniae 43816 , have shown that degranulation of myeloperoxidase , ELA2 , and cathepsin G are important for reducing bacterial burden of K . pneumoniae in mice ( Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . However , we found that despite equivalent levels of ELA2 , degranulation in Skap2-/- mice was not sufficient to control K . pneumoniae burden in the absence of ROS , indicating that neutrophil ROS and degranulation may cooperate in containing K . pneumoniae infection . Since degranulation occurred normally in Skap2-/- lungs , the pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling pathways regulating degranulation in murine neutrophils after K . pneumoniae infection . Neutrophils and ROS contribute to the defense against other pathogens such as Y . pseudotuberculosis , Staphylococcus aureus , Candida albicans , among others ( Green et al . , 2016; Mócsai , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) . The immunological mechanisms of SKAP2-mediated neutrophil responses to other pathogens are under investigation . We propose the following model for SKAP2-dependent neutrophilic response to K . pneumoniae in mice based our findings and work of others ( Figure 6; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Togni et al . , 2005; Timms et al . , 1999 ) . Following K . pneumoniae infection , activation of receptors , like GPCRs recognizing N-formylated bacterial proteins or mincle recognizing bacterial lectins , leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) and the generation of phosphatidylinositol [3 , 4 , 5]-triphosphate ( PIP3 ) , resulting in PIP3-mediated SKAP2 activation and membrane localization ( Figure 6A–B; Futosi et al . , 2013; Swanson et al . , 2008; Sharma et al . , 2014; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . The activated ( open ) phosphorylated SKAP2 complex can then bind to and enhance phosphorylation of SFKs shifting their active/inactive equilibrium to more active forms and leading to Syk activation ( Figure 6B; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Bureau et al . , 2018; Kouroku et al . , 1998; Lowell , 2011 ) . This is supported by previous biochemical and pull-down studies showing that SKAP2 can directly interact with SFKs ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Liu et al . , 1998; Wang and Rudd , 2008 ) . SFKs and Syk may directly associate with and activate Pyk2 , as observed in response to GPCRs , integrin , TNFα , and/or Salmonella stimulation ( Dikic et al . , 1996; Evangelista et al . , 2007; Han et al . , 2003; Mócsai et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , SKAP2 may interact with Pyk2 signaling complex directly or indirectly through their association with Sirpα ( Raab et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . Any of these mechanisms would promote stabilization and propagation of SFKs/Syk/Pyk2 phosphorylation in activated murine neutrophil leading to ROS . While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 have been shown to be important for degranulation in murine and human neutrophils ( Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Kamen et al . , 2011; Mócsai et al . , 1999; Han et al . , 2003 ) , we observed degranulation in murine lungs and low levels of phosphorylation after K . pneumoniae infection in murine neutrophils in vitro . These low levels may be sufficient to induced degranulation through a SKAP2-independent signaling pathway . Alternatively , specific phosphorylation sites of SFKs or Syk not tested here may still occurred in the absence of SKAP2 and be sufficient to induce degranulation ( Carsetti et al . , 2009; Tsang et al . , 2008; Moroco et al . , 2014; Mócsai et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , different domains of Pyk2 regulate ROS and degranulation ( Han et al . , 2003 ) . Specifically , the inhibition of the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in human neutrophils leads to a reduction in ROS production in response to TNF , Salmonella , and Listeria , but did not impair neutrophil degranulation and bacterial killing ( Han et al . , 2003 ) . SKAP2 may impact the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in murine neutrophils , but not activation of other domains . Skap2-/- mice have normal levels of circulating neutrophils and Skap2-/- neutrophils were present in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs at a similar , and sometimes higher , levels as WT neutrophils ( Figure 1C–D; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) and ( Togni et al . , 2005 ) . However , prior studies revealed that Skap2-/- myeloid cells , including neutrophils , have impaired recruitment and migration into tissues during sterile inflammation ( Tanaka et al . , 2016; Boras et al . , 2017 ) . This suggests that migration to sterile , but not infectious sites , may require SKAP2 , which is consistent with findings with Syk . Syk is required for neutrophil migration in an inflammatory model but not during bacterial infection ( Zarbock et al . , 2007; Frommhold et al . , 2007; Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Schymeinsky et al . , 2006 ) . Alternatively , it is possible that Skap2-/- neutrophils may have a reduced migration level in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs but this is balanced by significantly higher rate of neutrophil survival and these two factors result in a net neutrophil level that is equivalent to or higher than that observed in WT mice . This result could arise because ROS production can increase myeloid cell death ( Coxon et al . , 1996; Geering and Simon , 2011; Geering et al . , 2011 ) , and thus , defects in ROS production by Skap2-/- neutrophils could contribute to higher survival and accumulation in infected murine lungs . These possibilities are important to address with additional experiments , such as pulse-labelling newly differentiated neutrophils to track rates of migration during infection in vivo . Murine models of infection have been helpful in illuminating K . pneumoniae infection biology , however , there exist significant differences between mice and humans in the immune response to infection , including disparities in structural anatomy , circulating neutrophil counts , surface receptors , and signaling cascades , among others ( Mizgerd and Skerrett , 2008; Mestas and Hughes , 2004; Condliffe et al . , 2005; Hajjar et al . , 2010; Sun et al . , 2016; Bagaitkar et al . , 2012; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . Thus , to date it is unknown if SKAP2 plays a role in mediating the human neutrophil response to K . pneumoniae infection . Skap2 has 9 transcripts and at least 50 exonic variants that have been reported in the human population , however , their functional consequences , if any , remains unclear ( Cunningham et al . , 2019 ) . It would be interesting to explore if the SKAP2-mediated K . pneumoniae-stimulated responses occur in human neutrophils , and whether neutrophils ( or other cell types ) from individuals carrying specific Skap2 variants respond differently K . pneumoniae 43816 infection . In addition , it is unclear whether our results with K . pneumoniae 43816 will be found with other K2 strains or strains of other serotypes . Genome-wide analyses of K . pneumoniae clinical isolates have shown extensive genetic diversity , virulence factors , and pathogenicity ( Holt et al . , 2015; Deleo et al . , 2014; Agard et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , since neutrophils are not the major player in host defenses against all strains of K . pneumoniae , including some multi-drug resistant clinical isolates ( Xiong et al . , 2016; Xiong et al . , 2015; Broug-Holub et al . , 1997; Greenberger et al . , 1996 ) , future studies can use these K . pneumoniae strains to probe the role of SKAP2 in neutrophils as well as other hematopoietic cells during K . pneumoniae infections . In summary , neutrophils and their production of ROS play a dual role in host health in many disease states from acute infections to autoimmune diseases to cancer ( Hoffmann and Griffiths , 2018; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) , and the crucial function of SKAP2-mediated ROS in murine neutrophils suggests that further analysis of the role of SKAP2 in human health warrants investigation .\nBALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and Jackson laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) , respectively . Mating pairs of Cybb-/- in C57BL/6J background , and Skap2+/- ( B6 . 129S5-Skap2Gt ( VICTR20 ) 21Lex/Mmjax ) were purchased from Jackson laboratory and bred at Tufts University in the specific pathogen-free facility of Tufts University . Generation of Skap2-/- mice in the BALB/c background was previously described ( Togni et al . , 2005; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . Skap2-/- mice were genotyped by two independent PCRs using primer sequences: SkapLeft-forward primer ( common for both PCRs ) , 5’ CAG CTT GCC GAC TTT TCT; GTLexVir , 5’GAG GGC TGG ACC GCA TCT GG; GTSkapRight , 5’CCG CCT CCC ACC CCT CAA TC following procedures described from Jackson laboratory and ( Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . All mice were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tufts University . Mouse infections were carried out as previously described ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) with the following modifications . MKP220 , streptomycin-resistant derivative of K . pneumoniae ATCC43816 strain was used for all infections ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Isoflurane anesthetized mice on a BALB/c background were intranasally infected dropwise with 5 × 103 cfu K . pneumoniae in 40 μl of sterile PBS , or with PBS ( Fisher Scientific ) alone . C57BL/6J mice were inoculated retropharyngeally with 5 × 103 cfu as previously described ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . This change in infection route was because we have found that if delivered intranasally , C57BL/6J mice will rapidly dispel the inoculum through their nose and mouth resulting in inconsistent infection . Mice were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation at the indicated time points after infection . Lungs were collected into sterile PBS , weighed , and aseptically homogenized by pushing the tissue through a 70 μM cell strainer . For bacterial burden analyses , serially diluted homogenates were plated on L-agar and incubated at 37°C overnight to determine CFU/g lung . For depletion of neutrophils or iMOs , mice were intraperitoneally injecting 100 μl of 50 μg/ml α-Ly6G antibody ( clone: 1A8 , Fisher Scientific ) , or 100 μl of 200 μg/ml α-MC21 antibody 16 hr pre-infection . Depletion efficiency was measured by flow cytometry as described below . Collection of bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted as previously described ( Silver et al . , 2019 ) . 4–5 week-old BALB/c and Skap2-/- mice received 100 mg/kg/24 hr SulfaTrim available ad libitum in drinking water for a week prior to and a week following whole body irradiation . Mice were lethally irradiated with 2 doses of 4 . 5 Gγ with a 3–4 hr interval between doses . The next day , each mouse intravenously received 100 μl of sterile PBS containing 5 × 106 BM cells from either BALB/c or Skap2-/- donor mice ( 7–15 week-old ) and were infected with K . pneumoniae 4–5 weeks later . For histological studies , lungs from mock or K . pneumoniae-infected mice were perfused through a tracheal incision using 4% formaldehyde ( MP Biomedicals ) , removed , and incubated in fresh 4% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature ( RT ) . Excess fatty tissues were removed , and lungs were placed in histology cassettes for processing by the Tufts Animal Pathology Core . Tissues were embedded in paraffin and 7 μM thick sections were sliced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) . Sections were blindly scored for number of areas of leukocyte infiltration and detectable bacteria by 4–7 individuals with at least 3 lung sections per mouse using light microscopy . Three PBS-inoculated and 5 K . pneumoniae-infected mice were scored per genotype . Tissues were imaged using an Echo Revolve R4 microscope in the upright brightfield configuration at 4x ( NA 0 . 13 ) or 40x ( NA 0 . 75 ) magnification and acquired at RT using a 12 MP CMOS color camera and the Echo Revolve built-in software . After passage of lung tissues through 70 μm strainers , the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 13 , 000 x g for 10 min at 4°C . Supernatants were then transferred into new Eppendorf tubes for measurement of release of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP-9 ) , and neutrophil elastase ( ELA-2 ) by DuoSet ELISA kits ( R and D Systems ) per manufacturer’s protocols . After passage of lung tissues through a 70 μm strainer , cell suspensions were treated with 1 mg/ml Collagenase D ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 1 hr at 37°C , and then with 1X Pharm Lyse ( Fisher Scientific ) for 5 min at 4°C . Cells were resuspended in ice-cold fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) buffer ( PBS containing 1% FBS ) , and blocked with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 ( Mouse BD Fc Block BD Biosciences ) for 10 min at 4°C . For time courses , cells were stained with α-CD11b-PE ( BioLegend ) , α-Ly6G PE-Cy7 ( BioLegend ) , α-CD11c-PerCP-Cy5 . 5 ( BD Biosciences ) , and α-Gr1-FITC ( BioLegend ) for analysis of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6G+ ) , alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) , and dendritic cells ( CD11bhi CD11chi ) . For bone marrow chimeric and depletion experiments , lung cells were stained with α-CD11b-PacBlue ( BioLegend ) , α-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 ( BioLegend ) , α-Gr1-APC ( BioLegend ) , and α-Ly6C-AlexaFluor647 ( BioLegend ) for analysis of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes as indicated in figure legends . For some experiments , cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 1% saponin , and intracellularly stained with α-SKAP2 ( Proteintech ) or rabbit IgG polyclonal isotype antibody ( Proteintech ) , followed by goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488 secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Data were collected by a BD LSRII , and analyzed with FlowJo ( version 10 . 1 ) . Mouse BM neutrophils were isolated as previously described ( Rolán et al . , 2013 ) with the following modifications . Neutrophils were isolated using a three step Percoll density gradient ( 55% , 65% , and 75% ) , and centrifuged at 480 x g for 30 min at 26°C without applying the break . Neutrophils were collected at the 65–75% interface , resuspended in HBSS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ ( HBSS- ) , then centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min at RT to wash and pellet the cells . Supernatants were removed and cells were resuspended in HBSS- and centrifuged for a total of three washes . Neutrophils were rested at RT for one hour , resuspended in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ( HBSS+ ) to the desired concentration , incubated at RT for 20 min , and then shifted to 37°C for 10 min prior to the experiment . The purity of neutrophil preparations was verified by staining an aliquot of the cells with α-CD11b-PacBlu , α-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 , and α-Gr1-APC and analyzed by flow cytometry . Immortalization of murine BM cells with ER-HoxB8 was done as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) with the following modifications . Bone marrow stem cells were collected from the tibias and femurs of mice and passed through a 40 μm filter . Cells were layered over Ficoll-Paque-Plus ( Pharmacia ) , and centrifuged at 400 x g for 25 min at RT without applying the break to enrich for mononuclear cells . These cells were incubated in a 6-well tissue culture plate ( Greiner Bio-One ) for 24 hr at 37°C with 5% CO2 prior to the retroviral transduction in complete RPMI , cRPMI ( RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 100U penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) , supplemented with 10 ng/ml stem cell factor ( SCF ) , 10 ng/ml interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , and 10 ng/ml interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . The next day , non-adherent cells were harvested and 5 × 105 cells in 500 μl of cRPMI were plated onto a 12-well tissue culture plate ( Corning ) coated with 10 μg/ml human fibronectin ( Sigma ) . Retroviral supernatant ( MSCVneo-HA-ER-Hoxb8 ) was applied in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene and the plates were centrifuged for ‘spinoculation’ at 1000 x g for 90 min at RT . Following spin infection , cells were maintained in cRPMI supplemented with 0 . 5 μM beta-estradiol ( Sigma , E2 ) and conditioned media containing approximately 50 ng/ml SCF ( SCF + E2 cRPMI ) . Cells were maintained for 3–4 weeks to select for ER-HoxB8-carrying granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells . Uninfected cells were maintained alongside as controls and all died by 4 weeks . To confirm the identify of cell lines , we assessed for SKAP2 protein expression by intracellular staining or western blotting . Mycoplasma testing of cultured lines was conducted at 3–6 month intervals using e-Myco Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit ( Bulldog Bio ) . ER-HoxB8 stem cell lines were grown in E2 + SCF cRPMI . Differentiation into neutrophils was done as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2006; Pelletier et al . , 2017 ) with the following modifications . Aliquots of ER-HoxB8 progenitors were washed 3 times in PBS and cultured in E2-free cRPMI media supplemented with ~50 ng/ml SCF , IL-3 , and GCSF for two days . Cells were then restimulated with 50 ng/ml GCSF for another 48 hr . At this point , cells were differentiated and termed DIV neutrophils . DIV neutrophils were collected , pelleted at 250 x g for 5 min at 4°C , re-suspended in HBSS- and rested for 1 hr at RT . DIV neutrophils were re-suspended in HBSS+ to the desired concentration , incubated at RT for 20 min , and then shifted to 37°C for 10 min for functional assays . DAPI staining and flow cytometry were performed to confirm that >90% of cells were neutrophils . An aliquot of 1 × 105 BM and DIV neutrophils were spun onto microscope slide using Shannon Cytospin 3 , fixed with 4% formaldehyde , stained with DAPI ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Cell morphology was imaged at 60X by an Echo Revolve R4 microscope in the upright fluorescent configuration . Aliquots of cells were resuspended in cold FACS buffer and blocked with Mouse BD Fc Block ( BioLegend ) for 10 min at 4°C . Cells were then stained with α-CD11b-PacBlu , α-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 , and α-cKit-PE , and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde prior to analysis . Viability was assessed using trypan blue ( Gibco ) exclusion test immediately prior to functional studies to confirm that >85% of cells were live and all counts were based on live cells . In addition , an ATP-based assay , Promega CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell viability Assay , was conducted during the time course of several experiments to assess viability per instructor’s instructions ( Promega ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-F ) . Neutrophils ( 1 × 105 cells/well ) and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) -labeled K . pneumoniae ( MOI 40 ) were added to non-tissue-treated 96-well plates ( CellTreat ) , centrifuged at 250 x g for 3 min , and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 15 or 30 min . Cells were then harvested , centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min , and resuspended in 200 ul/well ice-cold FACS buffer; this was repeated for a total of 3 washes . Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde , and nuclei were stained with DAPI . The percentage of K . pneumoniae-associated neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry using uninfected neutrophils as control . K . pneumoniae MKP220 and a isogenic non-encapsulated ΔcpsB strain ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) were grown overnight in LB media at 37°C with aeration , and the next day diluted 1:40 into fresh LB media and grown for an additional 2 hr at 37°C with aeration . The Y . pseudotuberculosis YPIII ΔyscNU strain ( Balada-Llasat and Mecsas , 2006 ) was grown in 2XYT at 26°C with aeration . K . pneumoniae and Y . pseudotuberculosis were then used to infect 1 × 105 DIV neutrophils at an MOI of 10 for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 in 96-well 4HBX plates pre-coated with 10% FBS , and then 100 μg/ml gentamicin was added to wells for 1 hr at 37°C to kill extracellular bacteria . Control FBS-coated wells contained bacteria but no neutrophils and were not treated with gentamicin ( non-gentamicin-treated wells ) . All following steps were conducted at 4°C . Cold PBS was added to the wells; plates were centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min , and all media were gently removed; this was repeated for a total of four washes . All wells were treated with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 10 min at 4°C , and then serially diluted and plated to quantify surviving bacteria . The percent of phagocytosis was calculated as ( # of bacteria with neutrophils from gentamicin-treated wells ) / ( # of bacteria from non-gentamicin-treated wells ) . High-bound tissue-treated 4HBX 96-well plates ( Fisher Scientific ) were used for all ROS assays . Plates were prepared as follows . For integrin activation , wells were coated with 15 μg/ml poly-RGD ( Sigma ) for 2 hr at 37°C or overnight at RT . For Fcγ receptor activation by IgG immune complexes ( IC ) , wells were coated with 20 μg/ml human serum albumin ( Sigma ) for 1 hr , washed twice with PBS , blocked with 10% FBS for 30 min , washed twice with PBS , and incubated with anti-human serum albumin ( Sigma ) at 1:400 dilution in 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37°C . Control wells were coated with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37°C . All wells were washed twice with PBS prior to use . For experiments with K . pneumoniae , wells were coated with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37°C and washed twice with PBS prior to use . For all ROS assays , 100 nM of PMA was used as positive control . To evaluate whether Skap2-/- neutrophils generated ROS after infection with another species of bacteria , a Y . pseudotuberculosis YPIII type 3 secretion mutant , ΔyscF was used ( Green et al . , 2016 ) . To detect RGD or IgG IC-stimulated ROS , superoxide detection by cytochrome C ( Sigma ) was performed as previously described ( Lowell et al . , 1996 ) with the following modifications . Cytochrome C was added to each well at a final concentration of 100 μM and 1 × 105 neutrophils were added to each well coated with either FBS or ligand . Absorbance at 490 nm and 550 nm were recorded at 37°C using Biotek Synergy HT . Superoxide concentration was calculated by ( OD550-OD490 ) x ( 2 . 11 × 104 M−1cm−1 ) , which is the extinction coefficient of cytochrome C ( Dahlgren et al . , 2007 ) . Total superoxide production was calculated by the sum of the area under the curves for the indicated time . To detect ROS production following K . pneumoniae exposure , isoluminol was performed as previously described ( Kobayashi et al . , 2016; Dahlgren et al . , 2007 ) with the following modifications . Neutrophils resuspended in HBSS+ , rested at RT for 30 min , were loaded with 50 μM isoluminol ( Sigma ) and 15 U/ml HRP ( Sigma ) , added to a 96-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well , and incubated at 37°C for 10 min . K . pneumoniae ( grown as described in gentamicin protection assays ) were then added to wells at a MOI of 2 . 5 or 5 , and the plate was centrifuged at 500 x g for 3 min at 4°C . For inhibitor studies , following isoluminol and HRP loading , DIV neutrophils were pre-treated with 10 nM PP2 ( Selleck Chemical ) , 2 μM R406 ( Selleck Chemical ) , 1 μM Ibrutinib ( Selleck Chemical ) , 10 μM Go 6983 ( Abcam ) , 1 μM U-73122 ( Sigma ) , 1 μM U-73433 ( Sigma ) , or DMSO ( 1:10 , 000 final concentration , Sigma ) vehicle control for 10 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 . A BioTek Synergy HT late reader was used to detect chemiluminescence ( RLU ) . Total ROS ( total RLU ) production was calculated by the sum of the area under the curves for the indicated time in figure legends . DIV neutrophils ( 7 . 5 × 105 cells/well ) in HBSS+ were plated onto 96-well 4HBX plates coated with 10% FBS . K . pneumoniae was added at MOI 40 and spun at 250 x g for 2 min . Cells were incubated at 37°C in presence of 5% CO2 for 10 or 15 min , lysed in 1X Novex buffer ( 4X stock: 40% sucrose , 6 . 82% Tris-Base , 6 . 66% Tris-HCL , 8% SDS , 0 . 06% EDTA , 0 . 075% Bromophenol Blue , 2 . 5 mM NaVO4 , 100 mM DTT ) and 5–7 . 5 × 105 cells equivalents were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gel ( Invitrogen ) in MOPS buffer ( 10 . 5% MOPS , 6% Tris-Base , 5% SDS , 0 . 3% EDTA ) . Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF ( Millipore Sigma ) and subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 unless otherwise indicated . Antibodies to phosphorylated proteins include Src Family-Y416 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , Syk-Y352 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) and Pyk2-Y402 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . All blots were also probed with RhoGDI ( Cell Signaling Technology ) at a dilution of 1:1000 as loading control . Secondary LI-COR goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 CW ( Cell Signaling Technology ) and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 CW ( Cell Signaling Technology ) were used at a dilution of 1:20 , 000 . The Odyssey CLx LI-COR system was used to develop the blots and IS Image Studio was used for analysis and quantification of bands . Blots were then stripped with 7M Guanine Hydrochloride ( Fisher Scientific ) by incubating at 56°C for 30 min with shaking , washed 3 times in 1x TBST ( 0 . 1% Tween-20 in 1x TBS ) , and reprobed with antibodies for total proteins against Syk and Pyk2 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . The normalized protein level of pSFKs was calculated by taking the ratio of phosphorylated protein to RhoGDI loading control . The normalized protein levels of pSyk and pPyk2 were calculated by first taking the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein and then normalizing to the RhoGDI loading control . Normalized phospho-protein levels were used to calculate the fold change to unstimulated ( 0 min ) control within each group , or to unstimulated control of WT ( Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , the relative induction of phosphorylation in unstimulated controls was determined by dividing the fold change of each experiment by the average of the three experiments . Fold change was log transformed and subjected to statistical analysis . Differences between the groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with either Tukey’s or Sidak’s post-test , where appropriate ( GraphPad Software version 7 ) . Log-transformed values were used for determining significance in experiments measuring CFU .",
         "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections – including pneumonia , blood stream infections , and urinary tract infections – in hospitalized patients . These infections can be difficult to treat because some K . pneumoniae are resistant to antibiotics . The bacteria are normally found in the human intestine , and they do not usually cause infections in healthy people . This implies that healthy people’s immune systems are better able to fend off K . pneumoniae infections; learning how could help scientists develop new ways to treat or prevent infections in hospitalized patients . In healthy people , a type of immune cell called neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacterial infections . Several different proteins are needed to activate neutrophils , including a protein called SKAP2 . But the role of this protein in fighting K . pneumoniae infections is not clear . To find out what role SKAP2 plays in the defense against pneumonia caused by K . pneumoniae , Nguyen et al . compared infections in mice with and without the protein . Mice lacking SKAP2 in their white blood cells had more bacteria in their lungs than normal mice . The experiments showed that neutrophils from mice with SKAP2 produce a burst of chemicals called “reactive oxygen species” , which can kill bacteria . But neutrophils without the protein do not . Without SKAP2 , several proteins that help produce reactive oxygen species do not work . Understanding the role of SKAP2 in fighting infections may help scientists better understand the immune system . This could help clinicians to treat conditions that cause it to be hyperactive or ineffective . More studies are needed to determine if SKAP2 works the same way in human neutrophils and if it works against all types of K . pneumoniae . If it does , then scientists might be able use this information to develop therapies that help the immune system fight infections .",

         "Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur following activation of latent liver-stages parasites ( hypnozoites ) causing new blood-stage infections weeks to months after the initial infection . We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites , and validate it against data from tropical strains of P . vivax . The within-host model is embedded in a P . vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death . The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites , and some having intensely infected livers . Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P . vivax transmission . Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P . vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment .\nThe study of the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria has a rich history , with a theoretical foundation based on the Ross-Macdonald models ( malERA Consultative Group on Modeling , 2011; Smith et al . , 2012; Reiner et al . , 2013; Smith et al . , 2014 ) , a class of mathematical models describing the transmission of a pathogen between human and vector hosts . In the case of P . falciparum , the parasite has a reservoir in both the human host and the Anopheles mosquito , with transmission occurring when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a human . Ross-Macdonald models have provided insights into the dynamics of P . falciparum transmission resulting in valuable guidance for historical and contemporary malaria control programmes , most notably the large reductions in transmission that are achievable if the lifespan of the mosquito is reduced through vector control ( Macdonald , 1952a; Macdonald , 1952b ) . In contrast to the extensive theory of the mathematical epidemiology of P . falciparum malaria ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , P . vivax malaria has been comparatively neglected . This is in spite of P . vivax being the geographically most widely distributed species of malaria in the world , causing in the region of 80–300 million clinical episodes every year ( Mueller et al . , 2009a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) . P . falciparum models are not applicable to P . vivax as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages ( hypnozoites ) which give rise to relapsing infections—one of the defining characteristics of the biology and epidemiology of P . vivax ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) . In natural transmission settings relapses are often undistinguishable from re-infections from new mosquito bites or recrudescences of existing blood-stage infections . When the origin of renewed parasitemia following primary P . vivax infection is unknown , it can be classified as a recurrent infection ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver , but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P . vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection ( Ishikawa et al . , 2003; Chamchod and Beier , 2013; Roy et al . , 2013 ) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites ( Dezoysa et al . , 1991 ) . Relapse patterns and their implications for transmission have also been investigated using statistical distributions for the time to first relapse ( Lover et al . , 2014 ) . Here we advance on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of P . vivax . When a P . vivax infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a human , sporozoites are injected into the skin and migrate to the liver , where they invade hepatocytes and develop into either actively dividing schizonts or dormant hypnozoites . The development of actively dividing schizonts may lead to a primary blood-stage infection and potentially clinical malaria ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . Hypnozoites will lie dormant in the liver for weeks to years before activating to initiate new blood-stage infections . The biological mechanisms regulating the activation of hypnozoites remain unknown ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) , although a number of triggers for relapses have been proposed , including fever caused by other pathogens such as P . falciparum ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) and exposure to Anopheles-specific proteins ( Hulden and Hulden , 2011 ) . There is considerable geographical variation in the timing and frequency of P . vivax relapse infections , with strains from tropical areas having an average time to first relapse of 3–6 weeks and long-latency strains from temperate areas relapsing within 6–9 months ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Beyond the first relapse , periodic patterns in multiple relapses from a single mosquito bite have been observed ( White , 2011 ) . For example , following a single infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax the time until next relapse has been observed to increase with each successive relapse ( Berliner et al . , 1948; White , 2011 ) . In contrast , temperate strains are associated with a long latency period until first relapse ( of the order of 6 months ) followed by short intervals between successive relapses ( Coatney et al . , 1950; Hankey et al . , 1953; White , 2011 ) . A descriptive epidemiology of P . vivax relapses will thus require estimation of three key quantities: ( i ) the time to first relapse , ( ii ) the number of relapses per primary infection , and ( iii ) the duration of hypnozoite carriage . In this manuscript , a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate . This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P . vivax malaria . We use this model to provide qualitative insights into the relative contribution of relapses to P . vivax transmission and illustrate the consequences for controlling P . vivax with vector control and anti-malarial drugs .\nFigure 1 shows the best fit within-host relapse model to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P . vivax: South America , South East Asia and Melanesia ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . In each ecological zone , the number of hypnozoites N and the hypnozoite activation rate α were correlated ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . For example , a short time to relapse could be explained by a single fast activating hypnozoite or a large number of slow activating hypnozoites . Longitudinal data where multiple relapses are observed in individuals would allow better estimation of the number of hypnozoites in the liver and the duration of hypnozoite carriage . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 004 The within-host model can be used to simulate beyond the first relapse infection . Figure 2 shows some sample relapse patterns from the within-host models for tropical and temperate strains of P . vivax . This model predicts notable dose-dependency with increased numbers of hypnozoites associated with a greater number of relapses and shorter time to first relapse . Following the long latency to first relapse in temperate strains , the interval between subsequent relapses is considerably shorter . The within-host model assumes that hypnozoites act independently of each other , and hence the time to next relapsing hypnozoite is exponentially distributed . In particular we do not predict periodicity between relapsing hypnozoites ( in the absence of external triggers [White , 2011; Shanks and White , 2013] ) . If the simulated data are censored such that relapses occurring within 14 days of a previous relapse remain undetected ( due to either prophylaxis by blood-stage anti-malarials or the presence of parasites from an existing infection ) then there is an apparent periodicity in detected relapses . The observed periodicity of relapses will be determined by the duration of prophylactic protection and not via the biological mechanisms considered here . The periodicity in detected relapses is most evident for large numbers of hypnozoites with the period being determined by the assumed duration of prophylactic protection ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . However , as has been previously argued , periodicity in relapses could also be attributable to a cycle of fevers initiating hypnozoite activation which in turn cause new blood-stage infections and malaria-associated fevers ( White , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 005Figure 2 . Sample relapse patterns for tropical and temperate strains of P . vivax . A relapse is assumed to be undetected if it occurs within 14 days of a detected relapse . Both tropical and temperate phenotypes exhibit dose dependency , with a larger number of hypnozoites giving rise to a greater number of relapses and shorter times to first relapse . For larger numbers of hypnozoites ( N = 50 ) , periodicity in detected relapses is observed . The appearance of this periodicity is due to the undetected relapses .

For the temperate phenotype the time between relapses was calculated as the mean duration between consecutive relapses over the first 12 months based on 10 , 000 stochastic simulations . The red curves denote the time between detected relapses: it is assumed that within 14 days of a detected relapse some activating hypnozoites can go undetected due to anti-malarial prophylaxis or the presence of blood-stage parasites . The grey curve denotes the expected time between all consecutively activating hypnozoites . The dashed line denotes a 3 week duration which has been regularly been observed as a common period between consecutive relapses ( White , 2011 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 006 Figure 3 shows the predicted number of relapsing hypnozoites in a population exposed to P . vivax in the absence of new infections . For tropical strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver is expected to decrease exponentially , but the proportion of individuals carrying hypnozoites is expected to decrease at a slower rate as an individual can relapse even if they have just one hypnozoite ( Figure 3A ) . For temperate strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver decreases slowly , as hypnozoites remain in the long-latency phase for approximately 6 months ( Figure 3B ) . The model allows estimation of time to second , third and consecutive relapses in addition to estimates of time to first relapse obtainable via survival analysis of patient data ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 3C , D ) . The expected number of relapsing hypnozoites per individual is expected to follow an approximately exponential distribution ( Figure 3E , F ) in agreement with empirical observations ( Horing , 1947; White , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 007Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 007 Figure 4A shows the predicted steady states ( the equilibrium blood-stage prevalence in the absence of seasonally varying transmission ) as a function of entomological inoculation rate ( EIR ) . EIR is a measurement of the number of infectious bites per person per year . The proportion of people infected with hypnozoites is predicted to be higher than the proportion infected with P . vivax blood-stage parasites . For a given EIR , P . vivax blood-stage prevalence is predicted to be higher than P . falciparum prevalence as a single mosquito bite can give rise to multiple blood-stage infections . However this does not account for the longer duration of P . falciparum infections as a consequence of antigenic switching ( Molineaux et al . , 2001 ) , and the important role of heterogeneity in exposure ( Smith et al . , 2005 ) . With the exception of the P . vivax hypnozoite rate , these quantities can be measured in epidemiological field studies ( Smith et al . , 2005; Kelly-Hope and McKenzie , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 008Figure 4 . Within-host model for tropical relapses embedded in a P . vivax transmission model . ( A ) The statics ( estimated equilibrium prevalence ) of P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission for different values of the entomological inoculation rate ( EIR ) . EIR was varied by changing the number of mosquitoes per person m . ( B ) The number of hypnozoites per person is expected to increase with transmission intensity . The black line denotes the median number of hypnozoites , and the shaded areas denote the 50% and 95% ranges . ( C ) The distribution of the hypnozoite reservoir when PvPR = 50% . The grey bar represents individuals with zero hypnozoites . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 008 Figure 4B shows how the median number of hypnozoites increases with increasing P . vivax transmission . Figure 4C shows the distribution in the number of hypnozoites when PvPR = 50% . The number of hypnozoites per individual is predicted to be over-dispersed following a negative binomial distribution . Thus some individuals will harbour a large number of hypnozoites while some will have none . This phenomenon will be further amplified if there is heterogeneity in exposure where some individuals receive a large number of mosquito bites . The impact of malaria control interventions will depend on how effectively the parasite is targeted in each of the reservoirs in the mosquito , the blood and the liver . Figure 5 shows the qualitative effects of malaria control on the transmission dynamics of P . falciparum and P . vivax . Vector control with insecticide treated nets ( ITNs ) or indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) is assumed to increase mosquito mortality . The introduction of vector control is expected to cause a rapid decline in P . falciparum parasite rate ( PfPR ) , and a smaller and slower decline in P . vivax ( Figure 5A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 009Figure 5 .

Transmission model incorporating treatment of new infections with blood-stage anti-malarials . Treatment coverage χ is assumed , that is , the proportion of new blood-stage infections that receive treatment with blood-stage anti-malarials . There will be a delay between the emergence of parasites into the blood-stream and the administration of treatment following symptoms . This stage is described by treatment compartment Ti and lasts 1/ν = 7 days . Importantly , transmission to mosquitoes is possible during this stage as P . vivax gametocytes ( the sexual stage of the parasite that can be transmitted to mosquitoes ) are present in the blood very early on in the infection . Following treatment , individuals progress to a period of prophylactic protection Pi , during which they are not susceptible to new blood-stage infections but may still acquire hypnozoites from new bites from infectious mosquitoes . It is assumed that individuals remain under prophylactic protection for 1/ξ = 14 days after which they return to being susceptible Si .

Transmission model incorporating treatment of new infections with blood-stage anti-malarials and primaquine . The incorporation of primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is accounted for by assuming that treatment clears all hypnozoites from the liver as well as clearing blood-stage infections . A 14 day daily dosing regimen of primaquine which has proven efficacy at preventing relapses . In particular we assume treatment eliminates all hypnozoites , so that treated individuals move to compartment P0 ( under prophylaxis from treatment and with all hypnozoites removed ) . The 14 day treatment regimen is assumed to provide a period of prophylactic protection against new hypnozoite infection , that is , new hypnozoites cannot be acquired while primaquine is being administered . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 011 Figure 5B shows the effect of targeting the parasite reservoir in the blood by providing first-line treatment for new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or artemisinin combination therapies ( ACTs ) . See details of how treatment was implemented in the model are provided in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , 2 . Increasing treatment coverage leads to reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P . falciparum and P . vivax . Notably the reduction in the P . vivax hypnozoite rate is slow as the hypnozoite reservoir is not directly targeted . The hypnozoite reservoir can be directly targeted using a drug such as primaquine that can eliminate hypnozoites from the liver ( Wells et al . , 2010 ) . The inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in both the P . vivax parasite rate and hypnozoite rate ( Figure 5C ) , as individuals being treated for blood-stage P . vivax infections will also have their hypnozoites removed . A consequence of this strategy is that the hypnozoite reservoir can be targeted efficiently , as individuals with the most hypnozoites are most likely to relapse and potentially be detected by health systems . Figure 6 shows how the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment regimens preferentially targets the most intense infections , with the greatest reductions observed in individuals with the most hypnozoites . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 012Figure 6 .

Individuals with large numbers of hypnozoites are more likely to experience new blood-stage infections and hence become targeted for treatment and have their hypnozoites removed . This results in a selective targeting of the most intensely infected individuals . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 012\nRelapse infections arising from the activation of hypnozoites in the human liver have important consequences for the transmission dynamics of P . vivax . Hypnozoites in the liver constitute a third malaria parasite reservoir , in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito also present for P . falciparum . Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Macdonald models of malaria transmission through the addition of a state to represent the hypnozoite reservoir ( Roy et al . , 2013 ) , or as demonstrated here , through consideration of the number of hypnozoites in the liver . This allows the intensity of hypnozoite infection to be estimated which is crucial for understanding patterns of relapse infections ( White , 2011 ) and evaluating the effect of interventions such as primaquine treatment that directly target the hypnozoite reservoir . Hypnozoites are assumed to be subjected to two processes: activation at constant rate α , and death at constant rate µ . By considering infection with batches of hypnozoites , these simple processes can explain many of the complex patterns observed in P . vivax relapses ( see Box 1 ) . A key assumption in the proposed model is the constant activation of hypnozoites . This implies that relapses can occur immediately after primary P . vivax infection , in contrast to suggestions that the first relapse does not occur until 2–3 weeks later . The best evidence on early relapses comes from treatment efficacy studies where patients treated for P . vivax are followed for recurrent infection for 42 days ( Douglas et al . , 2010 ) . Except in cases with documented chloroquine resistance ( Price et al . , 2014 ) , recurrent infections are rarely observed prior to day 14 , however the inclusion of long-lasting anti-malarials in treatment regimens provides prophylaxis during this period making detection of parasites unlikely . In a recent study of the slowly eliminated drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) Tarning et al . ( 2014 ) tested a model where relapses occur in bursts every 3 weeks , but it arguably provided no better fit to the data than a model of constant hypnozoite activation . Testing the hypothesis of constant activation would require follow up of patients treated with rapidly eliminated artemisinin monotherapy , a challenging proposition given the concerns over artemisinin resistant P . falciparum ( Ashley et al . , 2014 ) . Although the model captures the key drivers of the dynamics of P . vivax transmission , it is a simplified representation subject to a number of limiting assumptions . The potential role of triggers of hypnozoite activation such as febrile illness ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) are not accounted for . There is no heterogeneity or seasonality in transmission , and no age structure . Incorporation of the acquisition of natural immunity into the model will be particularly important for settings with high transmission intensity where immunity has a role in regulating blood-stage infections ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . It is assumed that all individuals infected with blood-stage parasites are capable of transmitting to mosquitoes . Similar to the corresponding P . falciparum models , incorporation of these factors would change the quantitative predictions of the model , but not its qualitative behaviour . P . falciparum and P . vivax parasite prevalence ( PfPR and PvPR ) are the most widely reported and best validated metrics of malaria transmission from epidemiological studies ( Gething et al . , 2011a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) providing measurements of the proportion of individuals with detectable blood-stage parasites . In settings with similar levels of P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission , the model predicts PvPR to be greater than PfPR due to the additional blood-stage infections arising from relapses . However , this does not agree with empirical observations which find PfPR to be similar to or greater than PvPR ( Snounou and White , 2004; Mueller et al . , 2009b ) . This is most likely explained by the rapid acquisition of immunity to P . vivax ( Koepfli et al . , 2013; Mueller et al . , 2013 ) the low detectability of P . vivax blood-stage infections ( Harris et al . , 2010 ) , and the longer durations of P . falciparum blood-stage infection ( Molineaux et al . , 2001 ) not captured in the model . Furthermore , the additional P . vivax parasite reservoir in the liver means that PfPR and PvPR are not directly comparable metrics . Thus if a parasitological survey indicates similar parasite prevalence , a greater control effort will be required to reduce P . vivax transmission than to reduce P . falciparum transmission because of the additional infections emerging from the hypnozoite reservoir . The model described here allows the proportion of individuals harbouring hypnozoites to be estimated given metrics such as PvPR . The number of hypnozoites per person is predicted to be over-dispersed with some individuals with intensely infected livers and most carrying few or no hypnozoites ( Figure 4C ) . Estimates of the prevalence and intensity of hypnozoite infection will be dependent on both the uncertainty in the measurable data and the model assumptions . Vector control with ITNs or IRS , and treatment with effective anti-malarial drugs are the cornerstones of malaria control efforts targeting the parasite in the vector and the human host , however they are predicted to have different effects on P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission . Vector control interventions that increase mosquito mortality are expected to cause greater reductions in PfPR than PvPR ( Figure 5A ) , as higher levels of P . vivax transmission can be maintained with fewer mosquito bites . This has been observed in both Thailand ( Sattabongkot et al . , 2004 ) and Brazil ( Coura et al . , 2006 ) where increased vector control has caused greater reductions in P . falciparum than P . vivax . First-line treatment of new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or ACTs is predicted to cause moderate reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P . falciparum and P . vivax ( Figure 5B ) . The addition of primaquine to first-line treatment regimens is expected to cause large reductions in P . vivax blood-stage prevalence , as individuals with the most intense hypnozoite infections are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment and hence have their hypnozoites eliminated . The potential to simultaneously target parasite reservoirs in the blood and liver may turn the cause of P . vivax parasites' robust transmission into its Achilles' heel . In P . vivax and P . falciparum co-endemic regions , heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito bites may cause associations between P . falciparum fevers and the risk of future P . vivax relapses ( Douglas et al . , 2011 ) . Thus the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment for P . falciparum may also reduce P . vivax transmission . In addition to inclusion in first-line treatment regimens , primaquine can also be administered as part of mass drug administration ( MDA ) programmes . In treatment-reinfection studies of Papua New Guinean children ( Betuela et al . , 2012; Robinson et al . , unpublished ) , mass administration of drugs such as chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine successfully cleared P . vivax blood-stage infections but rapid recurrence of infection was observed during follow-up—most likely due to relapses . The addition of primaquine to the treatment regimen caused large reductions in the rate of recurrent infections . Although primaquine treatment clears the hypnozoite reservoir , it requires a difficult 14 day treatment regimen , and is not without risk due to vulnerability to haemolytic toxicity among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficient patients ( Howes et al . , 2013 ) . Individuals should thus be tested for G6PD deficiency ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) before the administration of primaquine . A primaquine analogue , tafenoquine , is currently undergoing phase three trials and is likely to be licensed for use by 2017 ( Llanos-Cuentas et al . , 2014 ) . Tafenoquine requires a single dose alongside a 3 day chloroquine regimen , but is subject to the same risks in G6PD deficient patients . A quantitative model of P . vivax transmission will allow for the benefits of primaquine treatment to be weighed against the risks of G6PD deficiency and the costs of G6PD testing . Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P . vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector , the blood and the liver . In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites ( malERA Consultative Group on Diagnoses and Diagnostics , 2011 ) , models will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir , either indirectly via vector control and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly via primaquine treatment .\nFollowing infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax , the population dynamics of hypnozoites in the liver can be described by a within-host model where each hypnozoite is subject to two processes: ( i ) activation leading to relapse infection; and ( ii ) death , either of the hypnozoite itself or the host hepatocyte ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . Constant activation ( α ) and death ( µ ) rates are assumed implying hypnozoite residence time in the liver is exponentially distributed . The long latency of temperate strains before first relapse can be accounted for by assuming a period of dormancy during which hypnozoites must wait before they can activate . A schematic representation of the within-host model is presented in Figure 7 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 014Figure 7 . Within-host model schematic of relapsing hypnozoites in the liver . Hypnozoites from tropical strains of P . vivax will progress to the relapsing phase where they are subject to two processes: death and activation leading to relapse . Hypnozoites from temperate strains will begin in a temperate long-latency phase where they must wait before progressing to the relapsing phase .

An individual infected with N hypnozoites of a tropical strain begins in the HNN compartment and progresses to HN0 as hypnozoites activate or die .

During this time they may also move to the right along the flow diagram as the number of hypnozoites reduces due to death . After passing through the M compartments for the long-latency phase , infections will enter the relapsing phase where relapse can occur . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 015 The tropical relapse model is assumed to begin with an initial population of N hypnozoites , each of which can either activate at rate α , or die at rate µ , independently of each other . The number of hypnozoites in the liver will decay exponentially with an expected Ne− ( µ+α ) t hypnozoites at time t . Let HiN ( t ) denote the probability that i of N hypnozoites remain in the liver after time t . The hypnozoite population dynamics can be described by the following set of equations: ( 1 ) dHNNdt=− ( μ+α ) NHNNdHiNdt=− ( μ+α ) iHiN+ ( μ+α ) ( i+1 ) Hi+1N , i=0…N−1 Equation 1 can be solved analytically to give: ( 2 ) HiN ( t ) = ( Ni ) e−N ( μ+α ) t ( e ( μ+α ) t−1 ) N−i Define PjN ( t ) to be the probability that j relapses have occurred by time t . This can be calculated as follows: if i hypnozoites remain in the liver , then N − i have either activated or died . The probability of each hypnozoite activating is αμ+α . The probability that j of N − i hypnozoites have activated can thus be calculated from a binomial distribution . Summing over the allowable number of hypnozoites ( at least j hypnozoites must have activated or died for j relapses to be observed ) gives: ( 3 ) PjN ( t ) =∑i=0N−j ( N−ij ) ( αμ+α ) j ( μμ+α ) N−i−jHiN ( t ) = ( Nj ) αjμN−j ( μ+α ) N ( 1−e− ( μ+α ) t ) N ( 1+μ+αμ1e ( μ+α ) t−1 ) N−j Equations 1–3 describe the population dynamics of hypnozoites in a single individual with N hypnozoites in the absence of exposure to new infections . In a population of individuals , we would expect substantial variation in the numbers of hypnozoites due to heterogeneity in exposure and the variation in sporozoite inoculum from each infectious mosquito bite ( Beier et al . , 1991; Medica and Sinnis , 2005; White et al . , 2013 ) . Based on evidence that the number of sporozoites injected with a mosquito bite approximately follows a geometric distribution ( Beier et al . , 1991 ) , we assume that the number of hypnozoites following a primary infection is also geometrically distributed . If the mean number of hypnozoites is N , then the probability of k hypnozoites is ( NN+1 ) k1N+1 . Assuming a geometrically distributed number of hypnozoites , the three quantities describing the epidemiology of relapses can be estimated in terms of the within-host parameters . The expected number of relapsing hypnozoites is: ( 4 ) h=∑k=0∞ ( NN+1 ) k1N+1︸probability of k initial hypnozoites k αα+μ︸probability of each hypnozoite relapsing=Nαμ+α The mean duration of hypnozoite carriage is: ( 5 ) 1γ=∑k=0∞ ( NN+1 ) k1N+1︸probability of k initial hypnozoites∑i=1k1i1μ+α︸duration of k hypnozoites=log ( N+1 ) μ+α The expected time to first relapse is: ( 6 ) 1f=∑k=1∞[ ( NN+1 ) k1N]︸probability of k initial hypnozoites∑i=1k[ ( μμ+α ) k−iαμ+α/ ( 1− ( μμ+α ) k ) ]︸probability of hypnozoite i being first to relapse∑j=0k−i1k−j1μ+α︸time to relapse The within-host relapse model describes a baseline scenario in the absence of potential external triggers for relapse such as fever ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) . Underlying assumptions of this model are: ( i ) each hypnozoite acts independently of other hypnozoites , for example , hypnozoites will not activate in batches due to mechanisms such as quorum sensing; and , ( ii ) hypnozoite death occurs at a constant rate , due to either death of the hypnozoite within the hepatocyte or death of the hepatocyte itself ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . The activation of a hypnozoite may not directly correspond to a detected relapse . For example , an infection arising from two hypnozoites activating within a day of each other is likely to be classified as a single relapse . The within-host model can be extended to account for temperate strains of P . vivax . We assume that before a hypnozoite is capable of activating , it must undergo a long-latency phase of duration d . During this period hypnozoites are subject to death at rate µ . In particular , we assume that the time spent in the temperate long-latency phase can be described by a gamma distribution with mean d and variance d2/M . This gamma distribution can be simulated by M successive compartments with exponential waiting times 1/δ = d/M . Increasing the number of compartments M reduces the variance in the duration of the dormancy period ( Wearing et al . , 2005 ) . Following a primary infection where N hypnozoites of a temperate phenotype develop in the liver , we define Li , jN as the probability that i of N hypnozoites are waiting in long-latency compartment number j , then the number of dormant and potentially active hypnozoites can be described by the following system of differential equations . ( 7 ) dLN , 1Ndt=−δLN , 1N−NμLN , 1NdLi , 1Ndt=−δLi , 1N−iμLi , 1N+ ( i+1 ) μLi+1 , 1Ni=1…N−1dLN , jNdt=−δLN , jN+δLN , j+1N−NμLN , jNj=2…MdLi , jNdt=−δLi , jN+δLi , j+1N−iμLi , jN+ ( i+1 ) μLi+1 , jNi=1…N−1 , j=2…MdHNNdt=δLN , MN−N ( μ+α ) HNNdHiNdt=δLi , MN−i ( μ+α ) HiN+ ( i+1 ) ( μ+α ) Hi+1Ni=1…N−1dH0Ndt=∑j=1MμL1 , jN+ ( μ+α ) H1N The equations are presented schematically in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 . Equation 7 cannot be solved analytically and must be computed numerically to calculate HiN ( t ) and Li , jN ( t ) . A greater deal of uncertainty surrounds the biological processes accounting for the initial long-latency phase observed in temperate strains of P . vivax . In the model implemented here , it is assumed that all hypnozoites in an infection must undergo some waiting period before any of them can activate , and that during the long-latency phase hypnozoites are at risk of death due to natural hepatocyte death . We next embedded the within-host model for tropical relapses in a model for the transmission of P . vivax between humans and mosquitoes ( Figure 8 ) . The transmission dynamics are driven by two processes: ( i ) transmission of parasites through mosquito bites; and ( ii ) relapsing of liver-stage hypnozoites to cause new blood-stage infections . As per the standard Ross-Macdonald theory , the force of blood-stage infections in humans can be calculated as the product of the number of mosquitoes per human m , the rate at which each mosquito bites a human host a , the probability of transmission from mosquito to human following an infectious bite b , and the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious IM , to give λ = mabIM . Parameter values are provided in Table 1 . The force of infection on mosquitoes can be calculated in a similar manner . We assume that people can be susceptible ( Si ) or infected with blood-stage parasites ( Ii ) , where i denotes the number of hypnozoites in the liver . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 016Figure 8 .

Individuals in all compartments are exposed to primary infections at rate λ , following which they will move down the flow diagram to a compartment representing blood-stage infection and carrying a greater number of hypnozoites .

The increase in hypnozoites in the liver is determined by the force of infection λ and the number of hypnozoites per infection N , and the decrease is due to hypnozoite activation α and death µ .

In the absence of super-infection , the recovery from blood-stage infection is ρi=r . Accounting for super-infections ( Dietz and Molineaux , 1973; Smith et al . , 2012 ) gives ρi=λ+iαeλ+iαr−1 . The within-host model for tropical relapses was fitted in a Bayesian framework to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P . vivax: South America , South East Asia and Melanesia ( see Source data 1 ) . The data are described in detail by Battle et al . ( 2014 ) . Individual-level data on time to first recurrence was collated from individuals exposed to P . vivax infection ( either via natural exposure or artificial challenge ) and mostly followed up in the absence of exposure to new infections ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . The likelihood of the tropical relapse model can be evaluated by applying the model to the data on time to first relapse infection . The first detected relapse will occur after clearance of parasites from the primary infection and after the period of prophylactic protection from anti-malarial drugs . Define QN ( t ) to be the probability that at least 1 of N hypnozoites has relapsed by time t . ( 9 ) QN ( t ) =1−P0N ( t ) =1− ( μ+αe− ( μ+α ) tμ+α ) N Accounting for a geometrically distributed number of hypnozoites gives: ( 10 ) QG ( N ) ( t ) =∑k=0∞1N+1 ( NN+1 ) kQk ( t ) where G ( N ) denotes a geometric distribution . An individual j followed up after a primary P . vivax infection will either relapse ( Ij = 1 ) or avoid infection ( Ij = 0 ) . Denote τj to be the time of detection of infection , or if uninfected , the time until the end of follow up . The likelihood of the parameters θ = {N , α , µ} given the data Dj = {Ij , τj} is: ( 11 ) L ( θ|Dj ) = ( dQG ( N ) dt|t=τj ) Ij ( 1−QG ( N ) ( τj ) ) 1−Ij The log-likelihood ( LL ) for all j individuals is: ( 12 ) LL=∑j ( Ijlog ( dQG ( N ) dt|t=τj ) + ( 1−Ij ) log ( 1−QG ( N ) ( τj ) ) ) Data on time to first relapse were not sufficiently informative to estimate the three parameters simultaneously and hence prior distributions were assumed . N was assumed to have an informative gamma prior distribution with median 10 ( 95% credible interval ( CrI ) : 1 , 28 ) ( Beier et al . , 1991 ) . µ was assumed to have an informative gamma prior distribution with median 1/200 ( 95% CrI: 1/309 , 1/140 ) day−1 ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . α was assumed to have an uninformative uniform prior distribution U ( 0 , 1 ) . The likelihood in equation ( Ishikawa et al . , 2003 ) was sampled using a Metropolis–Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm and the posterior parameter distributions estimated ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The posterior median parameter estimates and 95% credible intervals are presented in Supplementary file 1 .",
         "Malaria is one of the world's most deadly infections , causing 100s of 1000s of deaths each year despite being both preventable and curable . Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes . When a mosquito bites a human , Plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva . The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver , infects liver cells and multiplies within those cells without causing any noticeable symptoms . After remaining silent in the liver for weeks or months , the now abundant parasite ruptures the host liver cell , re-enters the bloodstream , and begins infecting red blood cells . If another mosquito bites the infected individual and takes a blood meal , the parasite moves into the mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues . There are several species of Plasmodium that are known to cause malaria . The most widely studied species is P . falciparum , which also causes one of the deadliest types of malaria . However , another Plasmodium species called P . vivax is the most widely distributed species and , despite being less virulent than P . falciparum , is particularly dangerous because it causes recurring malaria . In contrast to P . falciparum , P . vivax has the ability to form hypnozoites: a dormant form of the parasite that can remain inside liver cells for long periods of time , sometimes for years . The reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites can regularly populate the bloodstream with the infectious form of the parasite , triggering relapses of malaria . Even if an individual suffering a relapse receives prompt treatment to clear parasites in the blood , more parasites may emerge from the liver and cause new blood-stage infections . White et al . developed a mathematical model to help understand how P . vivax is transmitted . Unlike many of the established models of malaria transmission , the new model accounts for the reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites in the liver , and assumes that hypnozoites in the reservoir either die , or are activated and enter the bloodstream , at a constant rate . This produces patterns that closely match how often relapses occur in patients . White et al . go on to predict that although many infected people have few or no hypnozoites in their liver , some have many hypnozoites , and these people are more likely to suffer from malaria relapses . This suggests that if the initial treatments given to malaria sufferers incorporate additional drugs that kill the hypnozoites in the liver , then it may be possible to substantially reduce the extent of P . vivax transmission .",

         "When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year , more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) is emitted to the atmosphere . Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth . With an original modelling approach , calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia , we link regional differences in climate , soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery . We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall , high seasonality ) . We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia .\nWith on-going climate change , attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon ( C ) cycles ( Griggs and Noguer , 2002 ) , and in particular to the 2 . 1 ± 1 . 1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests ( Grace et al . , 2014 ) . Among those disturbances , selective logging , i . e . the selective harvest of a few merchantable tree species , is particularly widespread: in the Brazilian Amazon alone , about 2 Mha yr−1 were logged in 1999–2002 ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period , and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 ( Huang and Asner , 2010 ) which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to deforested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing , most selectively logged forests remain as forested areas ( Asner et al . , 2006 ) and may recover C stocks ( West et al . , 2014 ) . Previously logged Amazonian forests may thus accumulate large amounts of C ( Pan et al . , 2011 ) , but this C uptake is difficult to accurately estimate , because while detecting selective logging from space is increasingly feasible ( Frolking et al . , 2009 ) ( even if very few of the IPCC models effectively account for logging ) , directly quantifying forest recovery remains challenging ( Asner et al . , 2009; Houghton et al . , 2012; Goetz et al . , 2015 ) . Studies based on field measurements ( e . g . Sist and Ferreira , 2007; Blanc et al . , 2009; West et al . , 2014; Vidal et al . , 2016 ) , sometimes coupled with modeling approaches ( e . g . Gourlet-Fleury et al . , 2005; Valle et al . , 2007 ) or airborne light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) measurements ( e . g . Andersen et al . , 2014 ) have assessed post-logging dynamics at particular sites . Nonetheless , to our knowledge no spatially-explicit investigation of post-logging C dynamics at the Amazon biome scale is available . C losses from selective logging are determined by harvest intensity ( i . e . number of trees felled or volume of wood extracted ) plus the care with which harvest operations are conducted , which affects the amount of collateral damage . After logging , C losses continue for several years due to elevated mortality rates of trees injured during harvesting operations ( Shenkin et al . , 2015 ) . Logged forests may recover their aboveground carbon stocks ( ACS ) via enhanced growth of survivors and recruited trees ( Blanc et al . , 2009 ) . Full recovery of pre-disturbance ACS in logged stands reportedly requires up to 125 years , depending primarily on disturbance intensity ( Rutishauser et al . , 2015 ) . The underlying recovery processes ( i . e . tree mortality , growth and recruitment ) are likely to vary with the clear geographical patterns in forest structure and dynamics across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield . In particular , northeast-southwest gradients have been reported for ACS ( Malhi and Wright , 2004 ) , net primary productivity ( Aragão et al . , 2009 ) , wood density ( Baker et al . , 2004 ) , and floristic composition ( ter Steege et al . , 2006 ) . Such gradients coincide with climate and edaphic conditions that range from nearly a seasonal nutrient-limited in the northeast to seasonally dry and nutrient-rich in the southwest ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . These regional differences in biotic and abiotic conditions largely constrain demographic processes that ultimately shape forest C balances . Here we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia sensu lato ( that includes the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ) . Based on long-term ( 8–30 year ) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites ( Sist et al . , 2015 ) across Amazonia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) that cover a large gradient of disturbance intensities ( ACS losses ranging from 1% to 71% ) were used to model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes ( Figure 1 ) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework . We quantify the effect of pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics [the site’s average pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) and the relative difference between each plot and a⁢c⁢s⁢0 as a proxy of forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) ] , disturbance intensity [percentage of pre-logging ACS lost ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) ] , and interactions with the environment [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) , and soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) ] ( Figure 2 ) on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS changes converge to a theoretical steady state ( as in Figure 1 , see Materials and methods for more details ) . With global maps of ACS ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) , climatic conditions ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and soil bulk density ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , we up-scale our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss , which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( Blanc et al . , 2009; Martin et al . , 2015; West et al . , 2014 ) . Summing these ACS changes over time gives the net post-disturbance rate of ACS accumulation . Disentangling ACS recovery into demographic processes and cohorts is essential to reveal mechanisms underlying ACS responses to disturbance and to make more robust predictions of ACS recovery compared to an all-in-one approach ( see Appendix ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 003Figure 1 . Post-disturbance annual ACS changes of survivors and recruits in 133 Amazonian selectively logged plots . Data is available between the year of minimum ACS ( t=0 ) and t=30 years . ACS changes are: recruits’ ACS growth ( orange ) , recruits’ ACS loss ( gold ) , new recruits’ ACS ( red ) , survivors’ ACS growth ( light green ) and survivors’ ACS loss ( dark green ) . Thick solid lines are the maximum-likelihood predictions ( for an average plot , when all covariates are null ) , and dashed lines are the model theoretical behaviour . New recruits’ ACS , recruits’ ACS growth , and recruits’ ACS loss converge over time to constant values . A dynamic equilibrium is then reached: ACS gain from recruitment and recruits’ growth compensate ACS loss from recruits’ mortality . Survivors’ ACS growth and loss . decline over time and tend to zero when all initial survivors have died .

The closer the dots are to the x=y line , the better the prediction . Dot transparency is proportional to the observation weight: transparent dots are low-weight observations . Because mortality is a stochastic event , ACS loss has poorer predictions than ACS gain which is a more continuous process . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 007\nAt a given site , variations of post-logging ACS changes are explained with the disturbance intensity ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) and the relative forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) . At high disturbance intensity ( positive l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) as well as in relatively immature forests ( negative d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) , ACS gain from recruits is high: recruitment decreases slowly ( Figure 2b and Figure 3b ) and recruits’ growth increases rapidly ( Figure 2c and Figure 3c ) . In the same conditions of high disturbance intensity , survivors’ ACS growth is lower in the first years following logging than for low disturbance intensities , but declines slowly ( Figure 2a and Figure 3a ) . Disturbance intensity and relative forest maturity have a weak effect on ACS loss from both survivors and recruits ( Figures 2d , e and 3d , e ) . Overall , net ACS change stays high longer at high disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008Figure 3 .

( d ) Survivors’ ACS loss . ( e ) Recruits’ ACS loss . ( f ) Net ACS change . The net ACS change is the sum of all five ACS changes . ACS changes were calculated with all parameters set to their maximum-likelihood value and covariates ( except standardized disturbance intensity l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) set to 0 . Time since minimum ACS varies from 0 to 30 year ( i . e . the calibration interval ) and disturbance intensity ranges between 5% and 60% of initial ACS loss . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008 Variations of post-logging ACS changes between sites are explained with the mean ACS of each site ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) , climatic conditions [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) ] and the soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) . Contribution of survivors’ growth to ACS recovery declined slowly in sites with low a⁢c⁢s⁢0 and high water stress ( low precipitation , high seasonality and high bulk density ) ( Figure 2a ) . Survivors’ ACS loss showed the opposite pattern ( Figure 2d ) except in apparent response to high seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) that slowed the post-disturbance rates of decline of both ACS growth and loss . Despite slower recruits’ ACS growth in sites with high pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) , no other regional covariate had significant effects on recruits’ ACS changes ( Figure 2b , c and e ) . While no significant environmental effects were detected for recruits’ ACS changes ( Figures 2 and 4 ) , the survivors showed a highly structured regional gradient: ( i ) ACS gain from survivors’ ACS growth is high in the west and in the Guiana Shield , but low in the south ( Figure 4a ) , whereas ( ii ) survivors’ ACS loss is low in the south and in the Guiana Shield but high in the west ( Figure 4d ) . To illustrate how these regional differences will be critical for future ACS across Amazonia , we developed a map of net ACS recovery over the first 10 years after a 40% ACS loss by integrating the sum of ACS change predictions through time ( Figure 5 ) . Across the region , net ACS recovery over the first ten years after a 40% ACS loss is predicted to be 17 ± 7 Mg C ha-1 , with higher values in the west and in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 5a ) . The uncertainty in predictions was low to medium ( coefficient of variation under 40% ) in 82% of the mapped area , and high ( coefficient of variation above 50% ) in 5% of the mapped area ( Figure 5b ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 009Figure 4 . Predicted cumulative ACS changes ( Mg C ha−1 ) over the first 10 year after losing 40% of ACS .

Four areas were arbitrarily chosen to illustrate four different geographical behaviours: ( 1 ) the Guiana Shield and ( 2 ) northwestern Amazonia are two areas with high ACS recovery; the Guiana Shield has higher initial ACS and slower ACS dynamics whereas northwestern Amazonia has lower initial ACS and faster ACS dynamics . ( 3 ) central Amazonia has intermediate ACS recovery . ( 4 ) southern Amazonia has low ACS recovery . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 010 Four areas ( Figure 5a ) were selected to represent four contrasted cases of net ACS recovery in time ( Figure 6 ) : two areas , northwestern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield , with high ACS accumulation ( 21 ± 3 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) , one intermediate area , central Amazonia ( 15 ± 1 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) and one area with low ACS accumulation , southern Amazonia ( 12 ± 3 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) . Survivors’ contribution to the sum of ACS gains ( recruitment and growth ) over the first 10 years after disturbance was 71 ± 4% in the Guiana Shield , 71 ± 2% in the west; 63 ± 4% in central Amazonia and 55 ± 6% in the south . Predicted net ACS recovery ( Figure 5 ) and survivors’ ACS growth ( Figure 4a ) are highly correlated: ρ=0 . 90 ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011Figure 6 . Predicted contribution of annual ACS changes in ACS recovery in four regions of Amazonia ( Figure 5 ) . The white line is the net annual ACS recovery , i . e . the sum of all annual ACS changes . Survivors’ ( green ) and recruits’ ( orange ) contribution are positive for ACS gains ( survivors’ ACS growth , new recruits’ ACS and recruits’ ACS growth ) and negative for survivors’ and recruits’ ACS loss . Areas with higher levels of transparency and dotted lines are out of the calibration period ( 0–30 year ) . In the Guiana Shield and in nothwestern Amazonia , high levels of net ACS recovery are explained by large ACS gain from survivors’ growth . Extrapolation was based on global rasters: topsoil bulk density from the Harmonized global soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , precipitation data from Worldclim ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and biomass stocks from Avitabile et al . ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) map . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011\nContrasting post-disturbance ACS dynamics were detected among the western Amazon , Guiana Shield , and southern Amazon ( Figure 4 ) . ( i ) In the western Amazon , environmental stress is reduced due to fertile soils and abundant , mostly non-seasonal precipitation , but forests are prone to frequent and sometimes large-scale wind-induced disturbances ( Espírito-Santo et al . , 2014 ) . Such conditions of low stress and high disturbance tend to favor fast-growing species with rapid life cycles ( He et al . , 2013 ) , which results in fast ACS gain and loss from survivors even after the logging disturbance ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . ( ii ) Forests of the Guiana Shield are generally dense and grow on nutrient-poor soils ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) , where wood productivity is highly constrained by competition for key nutrients , especially phosphorus and nitrogen ( Santiago , 2015; Mercado et al . , 2011 ) . The short duration pulse of nutrients released from readily decomposed stems , twigs and leaves of trees damaged and killed by logging may thus explain the substantial but limited-duration increase in growth of survivors on these nutrient-poor soils ( Figure 6 ) . Yet post-disturbance ACS loss from survivors’ mortality decreases slowly in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 6 ) . This is consistent with the low mortality rates and the high tree longevity reported in old-growth forests of this region ( Phillips et al . , 2004 ) . ( iii ) In the southern Amazon , high seasonal water stress is the main constraint on ACS recovery ( Wagner et al . , 2016 ) . Stress-tolerant trees are generally poor competitors ( He et al . , 2013 ) and this may explain the slow ACS changes of survivors in this region ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . Finally , Central Amazonia is a transition zone for the main environmental and biotic gradients found in Amazonia: ( 1 ) a competition gradient between dense and nutrient-poor northeastern forests and nutrient-rich western forests; ( 2 ) an environmental gradient between northern wet forests and southern drier forests ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . Across Amazonia , survivors contribute most to post-disturbance ACS recovery . In regions where survivors’ ACS gain is high ( west and northeast ) , net ACS recovery is also high: annual ACS recovery is between 1 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the first 10 year after logging ( Figure 6 ) , lower than in Amazonian secondary forests ( 3–5 Mg C ha-1 yr−1 in the first 20 year after abandonment of land use [Poorter et al . , 2016] ) . Recruits , for their part , have very low geographical variations in post-logging ACS changes: 10 years after the disturbance they are predicted to store similar amounts of ACS almost everywhere in Amazonia . Nevertheless , small trees with DBH <20 cm have not been accounted for in our study and may play an important role in post-logging ACS changes . The 10–20 cm DBH size class contains as much as 14% of total ACS and may be highly dynamic in some Amazonian forests ( Vieira et al . , 2004 ) . Because of the slow tree growth rates in Amazonia ( Vieira et al . , 2005; Herault et al . , 2010 ) , many trees will not reach the 20 cm DBH threshold 10 years after logging: the effects of the 10–20 cm DBH stratum on post-logging ACS changes are likely to be missed in sites with less than 10 years of measurements ( e . g . Peteco , Ecosilva , Iracema , Cumaru ) and should be studied , together with the natural regeneration , in the future . At the stand level , high disturbance intensities reduce survivors’ ACS: survivors’ ACS growth is consequently lower ( Figure 3a ) , resulting in lower net ACS change during the first 10 years of the recovery period ( Figure 3f ) . High disturbance intensities as well as relatively low forest maturity alleviate competition , and this is probably why ACS contributions from recruits remain high for longer ( Figure 2b ) in such enhanced growth conditions ( Herault et al . , 2010 ) . In the first years after logging , net ACS recovery depends little on disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) , but recovery is predicted to last longer in heavily logged forests . In immature forests , intense self-thinning ( Swaine et al . , 1987 ) may explain fast ACS losses from survivors’ mortality ( Figure 2d ) . In the tropics , reduced-impact logging techniques ( RIL; [Putz et al . , 2008] ) are promoted to reduce collateral damage to residual stands and biodiversity . Our results reveal that lower disturbance intensities , as a direct consequence of the employment of RIL techniques , could increase survivors’ ACS growth and slow down their ACS loss . Given that government specified minimum cutting cycles are short , e . g . 35 year in the Brazilian Amazon ( Blaser et al . , 2011 ) , and that many commercial species are slow-growing and dense-wooded ( Dauber et al . , 2005; Wright et al . , 2010 ) , available timber stocks for the next cutting cycle will be comprised mostly of survivors . Attention should be taken to high harvest intensities and/or substantial incidental damage due to poor harvesting practices that diminish stocks of survivors , even if they promote recruitment . Most trees that recruit are fast-growing pioneers that are favored by disturbance but are vulnerable to water stress ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) and competition ( Valladares and Niinemets , 2008 ) , and because their height is lower than in mature forests ( Rutishauser et al . , 2016 ) , they might have reduced carbon sequestration potential . With ongoing climate change and increased frequencies and intensities of droughts in Amazonia ( Malhi et al . , 2008 ) , betting on recruits to store C in forests disturbed by selective logging might thus be a risky gamble . In this study , we focus on one type of disturbance: selective logging . Because of its economic value and implications for forest management , selective logging is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests , and the data gathered by the TmFO network are unique in terms of experiment duration and spatial extent . We nevertheless believe that our study gives clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances ( e . g . droughts , fire ) that are expected to increase in frequency with ongoing global changes ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) .\nOur study includes data from thirteen long-term ( 8–30 year ) experimental forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Sites meet the following criteria: ( i ) located in tropical forests with mean annual precipitation above 1000 mm; ( ii ) a total censused area above 1 ha; ( iii ) at least one pre-logging census and ( iv ) at least two post-logging censuses . For each site , we extracted annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation data from WorldClim ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) , topsoil bulk density data from the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , and the synthetic climatic index from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) , using in all cases the highest resolution data available ( 30 arc-seconds ) . For one of our sites ( La Chonta , see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , field measurements of precipitation ( mean = 1580 mm yr-1 ) differed substantially from WorldClim data ( 1032 mm yr-1 ) : in this particular case we used the measured value and adjusted the synthetic climatic index ( E ) in the allometric equation ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) accordingly . Sites' data is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . In all plots , diameter at breast height ( DBH ) of trees >20 cm DBH were measured , and trees were identified to the lowest taxonomic level: to the species level ( 75% ) when possible , or to the genus level ( 15% ) ; 10% of trees were not identified . To get the wood density , we applied the following standardized protocol to all sites: ( i ) trees identified to the species level were assigned the corresponding wood specific gravity value from the Global Wood Density Database ( GWDD , doi:10 . 5061/dryad . 234/1 ) ( Zanne et al . , 2009 ) ; ( ii ) trees identified to the genus level were assigned a genus-average wood density; ( iii ) trees with no botanical identification or that were not in the GWDD were assigned the site-average wood density . The aboveground biomass ( AGB ) was estimated with the allometric equations from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Biomass was assumed to be 50% carbon ( Penman et al . , 2003 ) . The ACS of every tree i was then computed as follows: ( 1 ) ACSi^=exp ( −1 . 803−0 . 976×E+0 . 976×ln ( WDi ) ++2 . 673×ln ( DBHi ) −0 . 0299×ln ( DBHi2 ) ) ×0 . 5 where W⁢Di and D⁢B⁢Hi are the specific wood density and diameter at breast height of the tree i and E is the synthetic climatic index ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . The ACS changes data that was generated is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . After logging , plot ACS decreases rapidly until it reaches its minimum value ( a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢n ) a few years later . This transition point determines the beginning tm⁢i⁢n=t0 of the recovery period . a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢n was estimated as the minimum ACS in the 4 years following logging activities . Because our focus is on post-logging ACS recovery , we did not include in our analysis plots where the minimum ACS value was not reached within the 4 years after logging , either because the logging activity did not affect the plot or because there were other sources of disturbance long after logging ( fire , road opening , silvicultural treatments ) . For each plot j and census k , with tk the time since the beginning of the recovery period t0 , we define 5 ACS changes : new recruits’ ACS ( R⁢rj , k ) is the ACS of all trees <20 cm DBH at tk-1 and ≥20 cm DBH at tk; recruits’ ACS growth ( R⁢gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living recruits between tk-1 and tk ; recruits’ ACS loss ( R⁢lj , k ) is the C in recruits that die between tk-1 and tk; survivors’ ACS growth ( S⁢gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living survivors between tk-1 and tk; survivors’ ACS loss ( S⁢lj , k ) is the ACS of survivors that die between tk-1 and tk . ACS gains ( S⁢g , R⁢r , R⁢g ) are positive and ACS losses ( S⁢l , R⁢l ) are negative . Instantaneous ACS changes are subject to stochastic variation over time: because we are less interested in year-to-year variations than in long-term ACS trajectories , we modelled cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . Cumulative ACS changes ( Mg C ha-1 ) were defined as follows: ( 2 ) c⁢C⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢ej , k=∑m=0kC⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢ej , m where j is the plot , tk the time since t0 ( yr ) and C⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢e is the annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , either recruits’ ACS ( R⁢r ) , recruits’ ACS growth ( R⁢g ) , recruits’ ACS loss ( R⁢l ) , survivors’ ACS growth ( S⁢g ) , or survivors’ ACS loss ( S⁢l ) . To model ACS changes , we chose six covariates : ( 1 ) l⁢o⁢s⁢s disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a⁢c⁢s⁢0 mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d⁢a⁢c⁢s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a⁢c⁢s⁢0; ( 4 ) p⁢r⁢e⁢c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s⁢e⁢a⁢s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b⁢d topsoil bulk density . To give equivalent weight to all covariates , we centred and standardized them in order to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one over all observations . The uncertainty associated with ACS covariates ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s , a⁢c⁢s⁢0 , d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) is less than 10% ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Climatic covariates ( annual precipitation p⁢r⁢e⁢c and precipitation seasonality s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) were extracted from Worldclim rasters ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) . Error in Worldclim precipitation data was estimated to be <10 mm in Amazonia ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) . There is no information on the uncertainty on topsoil bulk density but we expect it to be higher than the uncertainty on other covariates , due to measurement ( De Vos et al . , 2005 ) and interpolation methods ( Hendriks et al . , 2016 ) . Survivors’ cumulative ACS changes are null at t=0 ( by definition ) . When all survivors are dead , their ACS changes stop: annual ACS changes become null and cumulative ACS changes reach a constant/finite limit . We decided to model survivors’ cumulative ACS growth c⁢S⁢g and ACS loss c⁢S⁢l as: ( 3 ) c⁢Si , j , k∼𝒩⁢ ( αjS× ( 1-e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -βjS×tk ) ) , ( σES ) 2 ) where j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 , S is either S⁢g or Sl . αjS is the finite limit of the cumulative ACS change and βjS the rate at which the cumulative ACS change converges to this limit . By choosing an exponential kernel , we assume that survivors’ ACS change at tk is proportional to survivors’ ACS change at tk-1 . Because αjS values are expected to vary among plots , they are modelled with the following distribution: ( 4 ) αjS∼𝒩⁢ ( α0S , ( σαS ) 2 ) Parameter βjS is the rate at which survivors’ ACS change ( from growth or mortality ) on plot j converges to a finite limit after the disturbance: it reflects the response rapidity of survivors’ ACS changes to disturbance . Because we are interested in predicting variations in βjS ( S is either S⁢g or S⁢l ) , we expressed βjS as a function of covariates: ( 5 ) βjS=β0S+∑l=16 ( λlS×Vj , l ) where ∑l=16 ( λlS×Vj , l ) , is the effect of covariates ( Vj , l ) on the post-logging rate βj . Covariates are centred and standardized and are ( 1 ) l⁢o⁢s⁢s : disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a⁢c⁢s⁢0 : mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d⁢a⁢c⁢s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a⁢c⁢s⁢0; ( 4 ) p⁢r⁢e⁢c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s⁢e⁢a⁢s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b⁢d topsoil bulk density . When all survivors in plot j are dead , all the C gained by their growth ( c⁢S⁢gj , ∞=αjS⁢g ) plus their initial ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj ) will have been lost ( c⁢S⁢lj , ∞=αjS⁢l ) . We thus added the following constraint to each plot j: ( 6 ) αjS⁢l+αjS⁢g+a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj=0 with αjS⁢g , αjS⁢l the finite limits of survivors’ cumulative ACS growth and ACS loss respectively , and a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj the ACS of the plot j at tm⁢i⁢n=t0 . When survivors are all dead , recruits will constitute the new forest . We made the assumption that the ACS of this new forest will reach a dynamic equilibrium: recruits’ annual ACS changes are expected to converge to constant values ( that are however prone to small inter-annual variations ) , with ACS gains compensating ACS losses . Because there are no recruits yet at t0 , recruits’ annual ACS growth ( R⁢g ) and ACS loss ( R⁢l ) are zero , and progressively increase to reach their asymptotic values . Recruits’ annual ACS growth and ACS loss can be thus modelled with the function: ( 7 ) f⁢ ( t;α , β ) =α× ( 1-e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -β×t ) ) where t is the time since the beginning of the recovery period . In the same logic as survivors’ cumulative ACS change , α is the asymptotic value of recruits’ annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , and β is the rate at which this asymptotic value is reached . Contrary to recruits’ annual ACS growth and ACS loss , the ACS of new recruits ( R⁢r ) is high at t0 because of the competition drop induced by logging , but then progressively decreases to reach its asymptotic value . We modelled it with the following function: ( 8 ) f⁢ ( t;α , β , η ) =α× ( 1+η×e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -β×t ) ) where t is the time since logging . The parameter η was added to allow annual recruited ACS to be higher than α at t0 . As stated before , we chose to model cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . The general model for recruits’ cumulative ACS changes is deduced by integrating annual ACS changes from t0 to tk: ( 9 ) cRi , j , k∼𝒩 ( αiR× ( tk+η×1−exp ( −βjR×tk ) βjR ) , ( σER ) 2 ) where i is the site , j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 R is either Rr , Rg or R⁢l . When R is R⁢g or R⁢l , η=-1; when R is R⁢r , η>0 . Once the forest reaches a new dynamic equilibrium , recruits’ annual ACS changes should depend mostly on each site’s characteristics: we expect there to be more inter-site than intra-site variation in recruits’ asymptotic ACS changes αR . This is why we use one value αiR per site i , and model it as follows: ( 10 ) αiR∼𝒩⁢ ( α0R; ( σαR ) 2 ) When the dynamic equilibrium is reached , annual ACS gain ( growth and recruitment ) compensates annual ACS loss ( mortality ) . We thus added the following constraint for every site i: ( 11 ) αiR⁢r+αiR⁢g+αiR⁢l=0 With the same logic as for survivors , we are interested in predicting variation in βR . Given that we use one value αiR per site i ( i . e . all plots in one site i have the same value for αiR ) , we chose to take into account the inter-plot variability as follows: ( 12 ) βjR∼𝒩⁢ ( β0R+∑l=16 ( λlR×Vj , l ) ⁢ , ⁢ ( σβR ) 2 ) Bayesian hierarchical models were inferred through MCMC methods using an adaptive form of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . Each observation was given a weight proportional to the size of the plot . Codes were developed using the R language ( RRID:SCR_001905 ) ( R Developement Core Team , 2015 ) and the Rstan package ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . A detailed list of priors is provided in Table 1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 012Table 1 . List of priors used to infer ACS changes in a Bayesian framework . Models are : ( S⁢g ) survivors’ ACS growth , ( S⁢l ) survivors’ ACS loss , ( R⁢r ) new recruits’ ACS , ( R⁢g ) recruits’ ACS growth , ( R⁢l ) recruits’ ACS loss . λl⁢o⁢s⁢s is the parameter relative to the covariate l⁢o⁢s⁢s ( logging intensity ) .

Maps were obtained with the following steps: ( i ) spatially-explicit covariates are extracted at the resolution of 30 arc-second from: the pan-tropical carbon map of Avitabile et al . for pre-disturbance aboveground carbon stocks ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) ; WorldClim ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) for annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation , and the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) for topsoil bulk density; ( ii ) disturbance intensity is set to 40% of pre-logging ACS loss , which is a common value for disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( West et al . , 2014; Blanc et al . , 2009; Martin et al . , 2015 ) , and the relative forest maturity d⁢a⁢c⁢s is set to zero; ( iii ) parameters are drawn from their previously calibrated distribution; ( iv ) to simulate random effects , all five parameters ( α ) are taken from their distribution 𝒩⁢ ( α0 , σα2 ) ; ( v ) for every pixel , we estimate the five cumulative ACS changes ( c⁢S⁢g , c⁢S⁢l , c⁢R⁢r , c⁢R⁢g , c⁢R⁢l ) 10 years after the 40% ACS loss , given the parameters value and the pixel covariates values extracted from global rasters . Steps ( iii ) to ( v ) are repeated 200 times and summary statistics are calculated for every pixel . Because a significant part of our sites have experiment duration lower than 10 years ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , we are less confident in Amazonian-wide predictions after that 10 year period . Maps were elaborated under the R statistical software ( RRID:SCR_001905 ) ( R Developement Core Team , 2015 ) .",
         "The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest tropical forest in the world . Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife , rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon , which is a core component of all life on Earth . Certain forms of carbon , such as the gas carbon dioxide , contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests . Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules . The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems . Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest . This “selective logging” results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest , but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow . New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees . However , it is not clear how differences in the forest ( for example , forest maturity ) , environmental factors ( such as climate or soil ) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon . Piponiot et al . used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest . The models show that the forest’s ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions . For example , the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable . The findings of Piponiot et al . highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery . The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest .",

         "Neurosphere formation is commonly used as a surrogate for neural stem cell ( NSC ) function but the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells ( NICs ) and NSCs remains unclear . We prospectively identified , and isolated by flow cytometry , adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− ( GEPCOT ) cells . They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2 . In contrast , pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent , expressed higher Glast , and lower EGFR and PlexinB2 . Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT , GFAP-CreERT2 , Sox2CreERT2 , and Gli1CreERT2 and were long-lived in vivo . While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide , pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ . Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells , though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression . Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo .\nNeural stem cells ( NSCs ) reside in two regions of the adult mammalian forebrain: the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle ( SVZ ) . SVZ NSCs persist throughout adult life ( Maslov et al . , 2004; Molofsky et al . , 2006; Imayoshi et al . , 2008 ) , giving rise primarily to neurons in the olfactory bulb as well as some astrocytes in the olfactory bulb ( Lois and Alvarez-Buylla , 1994; Lois et al . , 1996; Doetsch et al . , 1999b; Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Kuo et al . , 2006; Lagace et al . , 2007; Merkle et al . , 2007; Imayoshi et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2009 ) and oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum and cortex ( Nait-Oumesmar et al . , 1999; Menn et al . , 2006 ) . In vivo , these NSCs are quiescent ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) , resistant to anti-mitotic agents ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; Giachino and Taylor , 2009 ) , long-lived ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Imayoshi et al . , 2008 ) , and capable of regenerating the SVZ after injury ( Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; López-Juárez et al . , 2013 ) . Clonal colony-forming assays have been widely used to study neural stem/progenitor cells that give rise to neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes in adherent cultures ( Davis and Temple , 1994 ) and non-adherent neurosphere cultures ( Reynolds and Weiss , 1992 ) . However , in the adult forebrain it remains uncertain whether these colonies are formed by quiescent neural stem cells ( qNSCs ) or by mitotically active and shorter-lived multipotent progenitors ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 2002; Reynolds and Rietze , 2005; Pastrana et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . Moreover , reliance upon retrospective colony-formation assays makes it impossible to directly study qNSCs or NICs as they exist in vivo . Pioneering work by Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues has demonstrated the existence of a lineage of NSCs and transit amplifying cells in the SVZ that gives rise to neuronal progenitors throughout life ( Lois and Alvarez-Buylla , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Ihrie and Alvarez-Buylla , 2011 ) . By electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis they identified GFAP-expressing type B cells that appear to be the qNSCs . These cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents such as AraC and appear capable of repopulating the SVZ after AraC treatment ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a , 1999b , 2002 ) . Type B cells are thought to give rise to Ascl1- and Dlx2-expressing type C cells , which are mitotically active and ablated by anti-mitotic agents ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . The type C cells give rise to Dcx- and PSA-NCAM-expressing type A neuronal progenitors . These studies have provided a critical framework for understanding the SVZ neurogenic lineage , though the inability to purify live cells from each stage of this hierarchy has hampered efforts to assess their properties . The inability to prospectively identify and isolate uncultured stem cells from the central nervous system ( CNS ) has contributed to uncertainty regarding the relationship between qNSCs and NICs . SVZ NICs have been enriched by flow cytometry based on CD15 expression ( Capela and Temple , 2002 ) or ROS levels ( Le Belle et al . , 2011 ) . Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that NSCs express GFAP and that these cells sustainably contribute to neurogenesis in vivo ( Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a , 1999b , 2002; Imura et al . , 2003; Morshead et al . , 2003; Garcia et al . , 2004; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Pastrana et al . , 2009; Beckervordersandforth et al . , 2010; Giachino et al . , 2013 ) . Pastrana et al . identified quiescent GFAP-GFP+EGFR− SVZ cells and speculated that these cells include NSCs that give rise to more mitotically active GFAP-GFP+EGFR+ and GFAP-GFP-EGFR+ NICs but did not test this by fate-mapping ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , it has been suggested that nearly all GFAP-GFP+CD133+ cells are NICs and that these cells are the qNSCs in the SVZ ( Beckervordersandforth et al . , 2010 ) . Efforts toward prospective identification have therefore generated conflicting results about whether NICs are quiescent or mitotically active in vivo and regarding their relationship to NSCs . We have identified regulators of CNS stem cell self-renewal based on their ability to regulate SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis in vivo as well as multipotent NIC self-renewal in culture ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2006; Nishino et al . , 2008; Chuikov et al . , 2010 ) . However , an important question that we have not been able to address directly is whether those genes are necessary for NSC maintenance in vivo . Impaired NIC self-renewal in culture may not reflect reduced NSC self-renewal in vivo ( Joseph and Morrison , 2005; He et al . , 2009 ) . For example , the polycomb transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 is thought to be required for NSC self-renewal ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Zencak et al . , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . However , these studies were performed in germline knockout mice that generally die within a month after birth ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Jacobs et al . , 1999; Lessard and Sauvageau , 2003; Park et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , it has not been possible to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by NSCs in the adult brain or whether NSCs differ from NICs in their dependence upon Bmi-1 . Here we report the prospective identification of two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of cells in the SVZ: GEPCOT cells and pre-GEPCOT cells . The pre-GEPCOTs accounted for 6 ± 3% of adult mouse SVZ cells , were highly quiescent , lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture , and included type B1 cells based on marker expression , morphology , and position in vivo . These cells contained long-lived qNSCs based on both fate mapping and temozolomide resistance . GEPCOTs were distinguished by lower GFAP and Glast expression and higher EGFR and PlexinB2 expression . These cells accounted for 3 . 2 ± 0 . 7% of cells in the adult mouse SVZ , were highly mitotically active , highly enriched for NICs , and included type C cells based on marker expression , morphology , and position in vivo . Based on fate-mapping these cells were short-lived in the SVZ . Our data thus provide methods to prospectively identify and distinguish qNSCs from NICs .\nWe enzymatically dissociated adult mouse SVZ cells then sorted cells by flow cytometry into non-adherent cultures at clonal density ( 0 . 66 cells/µl of culture medium ) . We always replated neurospheres to adherent secondary cultures to assess differentiation into TuJ1+ neurons , GFAP+ astrocytes , and O4+ oligodendrocytes . On average , 1 . 8 ± 0 . 4% of SVZ cells formed neurospheres ( >50 µm diameter ) and 75% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( 1 . 4 ± 0 . 3% of SVZ cells ) . We systematically screened 383 antibodies against 330 distinct cell surface antigens ( Supplementary file 1A ) to identify markers that could enrich NICs ( Figure 1A ) . We identified 49 markers by flow cytometry that were heterogeneously expressed among dissociated SVZ cells . For each of these markers we sorted SVZ cells that differed in their level of staining into non-adherent cultures and assessed neurosphere formation . We found 17 markers that enriched NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells ( Supplementary file 1A ) . We multiplexed combinations of these markers to optimize enrichment while ensuring that most NICs were retained within the sorted population . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 003Figure 1 . Prospective identification and isolation of neurosphere-initiating cells . ( A ) A screen of antibodies identified cell surface markers of NICs in the adult mouse SVZ . ( B ) Flow cytometric gating strategy to isolate GEPCOT cells ( GlastmidEgfrhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−lowTer119/CD45− ) that represent 3 . 2 ± 0 . 7% of young adult mouse SVZ cells . Plots represent one representative experiment from at least nine independent experiments . For more information on gating see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 . ( C ) Frequency of all neurospheres ( >50 µm ) and multipotent neurospheres formed by unfractionated SVZ cells ( DAPI/CD45/Ter119− ) , GEPCOT cells , and remaining live SVZ cells outside of the GEPCOT population ( n = 9 independent experiments ) .

Isolating GEPCOT cells by flow cytometry . ( A ) Side scatter ( SSC ) and forward scatter ( FSC ) were gated to eliminate debris . The parameters of this gate can be set using mouse bone marrow as shown in the first panel such that myeloid cells fall in the center of the plot . FSC threshold was increased to eliminate as much debris as possible without eliminating cells ( this can be checked by sorting events onto a microscope slide and then checking by microscopy to determine whether the events include cells or debris ) . These steps ensure reproducibility across days in spite of extensive debris in SVZ cell preparations . Sucrose density centrifugation ( approximately 90% debris reduction ) or myelin depletion using paramagnetic myelin-binding microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , 130-096-733 , approximately ∼95–98% debris reduction ) greatly reduce debris but also reduce cell yield by ∼50–60% . ( B ) The sixth gate ( CD24/Glast ) is drawn using the ‘live SVZ cells’ population as a guide . On a plot of Glast vs CD24 , live SVZ cells should have two clearly resolved populations that are either CD24mid or CD24−/low . The CD24 gate excludes all the CD24mid cells and retains all the CD24−/low cells . ( C ) Most NICs and multipotent NICs were contained in the GEPCOT population , which was 20-fold enriched for NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . The remaining non-GEPCOT cells were threefold depleted for NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . Data represent mean ± SD from 11 ( neurospheres >50 μm ) or 5 ( multipotent neurospheres ) independent experiments . Significance was assessed using two-tailed t tests ( ** , p<0 . 01; *** , p<0 . 001 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 004 We greatly enriched NICs by isolating live ( 4′ , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) negative ) SVZ cells that expressed moderate levels of Glast , high levels of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , high levels of PlexinB2 , negative to low levels of CD24 , negative to low levels of O4 and PSA-NCAM , and were negative for the hematopoietic markers Ter119 and CD45 . We refer to these GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− cells as GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , B ) . GEPCOTs accounted for 3 . 2 ± 0 . 7% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 1B ) . On average , 36 ± 6% of GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( >50 µm diameter ) and 74% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 1C ) . Nearly all of the neurospheres ( 91% ) could be passaged ( data not shown ) . On average , each neurosphere gave rise to 53 ± 41 multipotent secondary neurospheres upon dissociation and replating , demonstrating self-renewal potential . Most NICs from the SVZ were contained within this GEPCOT population ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Given that individual NICs are unlikely to form colonies with 100% efficiency after dissociation and flow cytometry , most GEPCOT cells likely have the potential to form neurospheres . The ability to prospectively identify NICs made it possible to assess their cell cycle distribution in vivo by administering bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) to mice . After just a 2 hour pulse of BrdU , 35 ± 2% of GEPCOTs were already BrdU+ as compared to only 11 ± 4% of unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 1D ) . Longer pulses of BrdU progressively increased the labeling of the GEPCOT cells . After a 24-hr pulse of BrdU , 89 ± 4% of GEPCOTs were BrdU+ as compared to 47 ± 9% of unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 1D ) . GEPCOTs are thus highly mitotically active and enriched for dividing cells relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . The observation that nearly all GEPCOTs incorporated BrdU within 24 hr indicates that few , if any , GEPCOTs are quiescent and that NICs are highly proliferative in vivo . To assess the persistence of NICs in vivo we performed a series of lineage tracing experiments . Guided by previous observations ( Doetsch et al . , 2002; Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Arnold et al . , 2011; Kim et al . , 2011; Taniguchi et al . , 2011; Lee et al . , 2012; Wang et al . , 2012 ) we screened candidate CreERT2 alleles for the ability to recombine a conditional Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato reporter within NICs in vivo after 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen injection ( Figure 2A; 80 mg/kg body mass/day i . p . ) . We found that Dlx1CreERT2 ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Ascl1CreERT2 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005 ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , and Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) labeled 11–94% of NICs 2 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2B–F ) . With each Cre allele and at earch time point , the frequency of tdTomato+ GEPCOTs was statistically indistinguishable from the frequency of tdTomato+ neurospheres that arose in culture from unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 2B–F ) . This independently confirms that GEPCOT markers reliably identify uncultured cells with the ability to form neurospheres . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 005Figure 2 . Individual NICs persist only transiently within the SVZ in vivo but are constantly replenished by more primitive neural stem cells . ( A ) Mice bearing inducible Cre alleles and the Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato conditional reporter were induced with 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen injections ( 80 mg/kg/day ) then chased for 2 to 60 days before analysis of the percentage of labeled SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells in vivo or the percentage of labeled neurospheres ( >50 µm ) in culture . ( B–F ) Cells marked by recombination of Dlx1CreERT2 ( B , n = 4–7 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) , Ascl1CreERT2 ( C , n = 3 or 4 mice/time point in three independent experiments ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( D ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( E ) , or Sox2CreERT2 ( F , n = 3–4 mice/time point in four independent experiments for D–F ) . ( G ) A model consistent with the fate mapping data involving a NSC population that gives rise to a transient NIC population . Data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance was tested among sequential days of analysis ( 7d was compared to 2d , 28d was compared to 7d , and 60d was compared to 28d ) with a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons , *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 005 To assess the persistence of NICs in vivo we quantified the frequencies of all SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and neurospheres that were tdTomato+ at 2 , 7 , 28 , or 60 days after tamoxifen treatment . In the absence of tamoxifen we detected no tdTomato expression in SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , or cultured neurospheres in Dlx1CreERT2 mice ( Figure 2B ) . 2 days after tamoxifen treatment , Dlx1CreERT2 labeled 51 ± 6% of SVZ cells , 15 ± 6% of GEPCOTs , and 11 ± 4% of neurospheres ( Figure 2B ) . 7 days after tamoxifen this significantly ( p<0 . 001 ) declined to 8 ± 5% of SVZ cells , 0 . 7 ± 0 . 9% of GEPCOTs , and 0 . 9 ± 1% of neurospheres ( Figure 2B ) . 28 days after tamoxifen only rare SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and neurospheres were labeled ( Figure 2B ) . Dlx1CreERT2-expressing NICs thus persist in vivo for less than 7 days . Ascl1CreERT2 labeled most GEPCOTs and neurospheres . In the absence of tamoxifen , only 0 . 02% of SVZ cells , and no GEPCOTs or neurospheres , were tdTomato+ ( Figure 2C ) . 2 days after tamoxifen , Ascl1CreERT2 labeled 34 ± 7% of SVZ cells , 63 ± 8% of GEPCOTs , and 64 ± 6% of neurospheres ( Figure 2C ) . 7 days after tamoxifen a similar fraction of SVZ cells remained tdTomato+ ( 35 ± 3% ) but the fraction of labeled GEPCOTs and neurospheres significantly ( p<0 . 01 ) declined to 40 ± 4% and 45 ± 3% , respectively ( Figure 2C ) . 28 days after tamoxifen only 16 ± 0 . 9% of SVZ cells , 16 ± 0 . 6% of GEPCOTs , and 19 ± 1 . 0% of neurospheres were labeled . This further decreased to 7 . 5 ± 1 . 2% of SVZ cells , 12 ± 0 . 8% of GEPCOTs , and 8 ± 3% of neurospheres at 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2C ) . This demonstrates that most Ascl1CreERT2-expressing NICs persist in vivo for less than 28 days . In contrast to cells labeled with Dlx1CreERT2 or Ascl1CreERT2 , cells labeled with Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , or Sox2CreERT2 exhibited a sustained contribution to the pools of SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and NICs for at least 60 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2D–F ) . This suggested the existence of a long-lived NSC population in the SVZ that replenishes NICs and is marked by Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 expression ( Figure 2G ) . To test whether there is an earlier stem cell population in the SVZ we sought a CreERT2 allele that recombines in long-lived NSCs but not in NICs . Since prior studies have implicated GFAP as a marker of type B cells and NSCs in the adult SVZ ( Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a , 2002; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Giachino and Taylor , 2009; Giachino et al . , 2013 ) we performed lineage-tracing experiments with GFAP-CreERT2 ( Hirrlinger et al . , 2006 ) . In the absence of tamoxifen , only 0 . 02% of SVZ cells , and no GEPCOTs or neurospheres , were tdTomato+ ( Figure 3A ) . 2 days after tamoxifen treatment , GFAP-CreERT2 labeled only 5 ± 0 . 6% of SVZ cells , 7 ± 2% of GEPCOTs , and 8 ± 0 . 9% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . 7 days after tamoxifen this increased significantly ( p<0 . 05 ) to 11 ± 4 . 3% of SVZ cells , 19 ± 5 . 5% of GEPCOTs , and 18 ± 6 . 1% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . By 28 days after tamoxifen this further increased to 26 ± 3 . 7% of SVZ cells , 32 ± 4 . 7% of GEPCOTs , and 35 ± 7 . 2% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . At 60 days after tamoxifen we observed 23 ± 2 . 6% of SVZ cells , 34 ± 8 . 0% of GEPCOTs , and 37 ± 4 . 2% of neurospheres labeled ( Figure 3A ) . GFAP-CreERT2-expressing NSCs thus make a sustained and growing contribution to the SVZ , in contrast to NICs labeled by Dlx1CreERT2 or Ascl1CreERT2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 006Figure 3 . Identification of a pre-GEPCOT population that gives rise to GEPCOT NICs in vivo . ( A ) GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice were induced with tamoxifen for 5 days , chased for 2 to 60 days without tamoxifen , then conditional reporter expression was analyzed in all SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and cultured neurospheres ( n = 3–5 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) . ( B–D ) GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice were analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify reporter expression in SVZ cells without tamoxifen ( B ) , at 2 days ( C ) or 28 days ( D ) after tamoxifen treatment . ( B ) Without tamoxifen , virtually no SVZ cells expressed the reporter . For comparison to C and D , control SVZ cells are shown stained for Glast and EGFR as well as the distribution of the GlasthighEGFR−/low fraction with respect to PlexinB2 and O4/PSA-NCAM staining . ( C ) 2 days after tamoxifen , the tdTomato+ cells labeled by recombination by the GFAP-CreERT2 stem cell marker were GlasthighEgfr−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/Cd45− ( CD24 expression is not shown here ) , which we describe as ‘pre-GEPCOT’ cells . ( D ) By 28 days after tamoxifen , GlastmidEgfrhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− GEPCOT cells were also labeled .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 006 To better characterize the GFAP-CreERT2-expressing SVZ cells we examined the surface markers expressed by tdTomato+ cells 2 days after tamoxifen treatment of GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice . By flow cytometry , tdTomato+ cells were highly enriched for GlasthighEGFR−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− ( pre-GEPCOT ) cells ( Figure 3B–D ) . These cells differed from GEPCOT cells in that they exhibited higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2 expression . pre-GEPCOT cells made up only 6 ± 3% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 3E ) and yet , based on GFAP-CreERT2 lineage tracing , gave rise to many SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and NICs within 28 days of tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 3A ) . The GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOTs therefore included NSCs with a much greater capacity to contribute to the SVZ than Ascl1CreERT2-expressing NICs . To confirm this we sorted pre-GEPCOT cells to test whether they stain with an anti-GFAP antibody . GFAP expression was heterogeneous within the pre-GEPCOT population , with 21 ± 7% being GFAPhigh and 33 ± 2% being GFAPlow ( Figure 4A ) . This suggests that the pre-GEPCOT population is much more highly enriched for NSCs as compared to unfractionated SVZ cells , which contained only 2 ± 1% GFAPhigh cells and 6 ± 3% GFAPlow cells ( both p<0 . 01 relative to pre-GEPCOT cells; Figure 4A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 007Figure 4 . GFAP-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent in vivo but make an enduring contribution to the SVZ .

( D–H ) Conditional reporter expression in pre-GEPCOT cells at varying times after recombination with the indicated Cre alleles . These data are from the same fate-mapping experiments as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , including the same SVZ data for comparison purposes . Cre alleles that only transiently contributed to the SVZ ( Dlx1CreERT2 and Ascl1CreERT2 ) did not recombine in pre-GEPCOT cells , while Cre alleles that gave enduring contributions to the SVZ ( Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 ) did recombine in pre-GEPCOT cells .

( K ) Markers that distinguish pre-GEPCOT from GEPCOT cells . ( L–M ) Whole-mount SVZs were stained with anti-acetylated tubulin ( red ) , anti-β-catenin ( blue ) , and either anti-GFAP ( L , green ) or anti-EGFR ( M , green ) antibodies and pinwheel structures were inspected for the presence of GFAPhigh pre-GEPCOT cells ( open arrow in L and M ) and EGFRhigh GEPCOT cells ( hatched arrow in M ) by confocal microscopy . Images were taken at the apical surface except the GFAP depth projection which is a composite of 11 images at 2 μm intervals into the tissue . Scale bar = 5 μm . All data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance of differences between SVZ and pre-GEPCOT cells in C was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests . Statistical significance of differences in D–J ( among time points ) was tested with a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 007 Whereas GEPCOTs were highly enriched for multipotent NICs ( Figure 1C ) , pre-GEPCOTs were unable to form neurospheres . We sorted unfractionated SVZ cells into culture and found that 1 . 9 ± 0 . 5% of the cells formed neurospheres and 2 . 0 ± 0 . 4% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . Under the same conditions 32 ± 7% of GEPCOTs formed neurospheres and 38 ± 13% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , only very rare pre-GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( 1/1663 cells ) and only 0 . 3 ± 0 . 4% ( 9/1973 cells ) formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . To assess whether pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent or frequently dividing in vivo , we administered pulses of BrdU . Although 47 ± 9% of SVZ cells and 89 ± 4% of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1D ) incorporated a 24-hr pulse of BrdU in these experiments , only 3 ± 3% of pre-GEPCOT cells incorporated BrdU in the same mice ( Figure 4C ) . Similarly , 60 ± 6% of SVZ cells and 91 ± 3% of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1D ) incorporated a 2-week pulse of BrdU in these experiments , but only 4 ± 2% of pre-GEPCOT cells incorporated BrdU ( Figure 4C ) . These data indicate that pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent in the SVZ . To assess whether fate-mapping with CreERT2 alleles is consistent with the existence of a pre-GEPCOT qNSC population we assessed whether they recombined in pre-GEPCOT cells . Dlx1CreERT2 , which labeled 51 ± 6% of all SVZ cells and 15 ± 6% of GEPCOTs at 2 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 2B ) , did not label any pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 , 7 , or 28 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4D ) . Ascl1CreERT2 , which labeled 34 ± 7% of all SVZ cells and 63 ± 8% of GEPCOTs at 2 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2C ) , labeled fewer than 1% of pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 , 7 , 28 , and 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , both of the CreERT2 alleles that exhibited declining contributions to the SVZ upon fate-mapping labeled GEPCOTs but not pre-GEPCOTs . Neither the Dlx1CreERT2-expressing GEPCOT NICs nor the Ascl1CreERT2-expressing GEPCOT NICs gave rise to significant numbers of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs in vivo , at least under steady-state conditions . To assess whether pre-GEPCOTs contain qNSCs we tested whether the CreERT2 alleles that sustainably contributed to the SVZ over time ( Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 ) labeled pre-GEPCOT cells . Gli1CreERT2 , which sustainably labeled 8–19% of all SVZ cells and 26–40% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 2D ) , also sustainably labeled 7–13% of pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4F ) . Slc1a3-CreERT , which sustainably labeled 21–48% of all SVZ cells and 61–72% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2E ) , also labeled 31–36% of pre-GEPCOT cells 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4G ) . Sox2CreERT2 , which sustainably labeled 49–65% of all SVZ cells and 92–97% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2F ) , also sustainably labeled 87–93% of pre-GEPCOT cells 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4H ) . Thus all of the CreERT2 alleles that gave a sustained contribution to NIC and SVZ labeling also labeled pre-GEPCOTs , consistent with the suggestion that pre-GEPCOT cells contain qNSCs . Moreover , every CreERT2 allele that labeled pre-GEPCOT cells exhibited sustained labeling of not only pre-GEPCOT cells but also GEPCOTs , NICs , and unfractionated SVZ cells . We tested whether the GFAP-CreERT2 recombination pattern was consistent with pre-GEPCOT qNSCs giving rise to GEPCOT NICs in vivo . 2 days after tamoxifen administration to GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice , the tdTomato label was present mainly in pre-GEPCOT cells . On average , 29 ± 7% of pre-GEPCOT cells were tdTomato+ whereas only 6 . 7 ± 1 . 9% of GEPCOT cells , 2 . 2 ± 0 . 5% of PSA-NCAMhighCD24mid neuroblasts ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) , and 3 . 0 ± 0 . 8% of other SVZ cells were labeled ( Figure 4I ) . These data indicate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombines efficiently in pre-GEPCOTs but not GEPCOT NICs in vivo . 28 days after tamoxifen treatment , the percentage of labeled pre-GEPCOT cells increased to 44 ± 5 . 8% of cells ( Figure 4I ) . The percentages of labeled GEPCOTs , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells also increased significantly ( p<0 . 01 ) by 28 days–32 ± 4 . 7% , 35 ± 6 . 8% , and 20 ± 2 . 2% , respectively . At 60 days after tamoxifen , we continued to observe strong labeling in pre-GEPCOTs , GEPCOTs , and neuroblasts ( Figure 4I ) . Similar trends were apparent when the data were expressed in absolute numbers ( Figure 4J ) . These data suggest GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs that give rise to NICs , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells ( Figure 4K ) . We examined the localization of pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells in whole mount stains of the SVZ . pre-GEPCOTs were distinguished by GFAP expression , a marker of type B cells ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a ) and GEPCOTs were distinguished by EGFR expression , a marker of type C cells ( Doetsch et al . , 2002 ) . We stained whole-mount SVZs with antibodies against acetylated tubulin and β-catenin to detect ‘pinwheel’ structures associated with type B1 stem cells in the SVZ ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2008 ) then also stained with antibodies against GFAP and EGFR . Consistent with prior results ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2008 ) , we observed GFAPhigh cells at the center of the pinwheel structures with a single primary cilium on the apical surface contacting the ventricle and a long basal process ( Figure 4L ) . Since many pre-GEPCOTs recombined with GFAP-CreERT2 but virtually no GEPCOTs did ( Figure 4I ) , these data indicate that many pre-GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type B1 cells in the SVZ . In contrast , EGFRhigh cells had type C cell morphology: round , unciliated , and generally not contacting the ventricle , consistent with Doetsch et al . ( 2002 ) ( Figure 4M ) . Since all GEPCOT cells express high levels of EGFR ( Figure 1B ) while pre-GEPCOT cells have low levels of EGFR ( Figure 3D ) , these data suggest that many GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type C cells . Our observation that pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs raised the question of whether pre-GEPCOT cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents . To test this , we treated mice for 3 consecutive days with the CNS-penetrating DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide ( TMZ; 100 mg/kg/day i . p . ) ( Garthe et al . , 2009 ) then assessed SVZ proliferation , composition , and neurosphere formation 3 to 90 days later ( Figure 5A ) . 3 days after TMZ , mice appeared healthy and had lost less than 3% of their body mass as compared to before TMZ treatment ( data not shown ) . 3 days after TMZ treatment we observed a 23% reduction in the total number of cells per SVZ and this reduction remained nearly constant over the next 90 days ( Figure 5B ) . 3 days after TMZ we observed an 80% reduction in the number of dividing SVZ cells , based on BrdU incorporation ( Figure 5C , p<0 . 001 ) . The number of dividing SVZ cells slowly increased over time , recovering to 50% of normal by 90 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5C ) . 3 days after TMZ only 0 . 7% of the NICs observed in saline-treated control mice remained in TMZ-treated mice ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . By 16 days after TMZ treatment NICs recovered to 20% of normal levels ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . The numbers of NICs continued to increase over time , recovering to 55% of normal by 90 days after TMZ ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . NICs are thus virtually completely eliminated by TMZ but regenerate over time as expected . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 008Figure 5 . Treatment with temozolomide does not affect the frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells but ablates GEPCOT NICs . ( A–F ) Mice were injected with TMZ ( 100 mg/kg/day ) for three consecutive days to ablate dividing cells , then allowed to recover for 3 to 90 days before analysis ( TMZ 1x ) . All TMZ 1x data reflect 5–7 mice per time point from seven independent experiments . ( G–L ) Alternatively , mice were serially treated with two doses of TMZ 12 days apart then allowed to recover for 3 to 90 days before analysis ( TMZ 2x ) . All TMZ 2x data reflect 4–9 mice per time point from six independent experiments . At each time point after TMZ treatment the panels show the total number of cells isolated per SVZ ( B and H ) , the number of SVZ cells per section that incorporated a 2 hr pulse of BrdU ( C and I ) , the number of multipotent neurospheres that arose in culture per SVZ ( D and J ) , the number of GEPCOTs per SVZ ( E and K ) , and the number of pre-GEPCOTs per SVZ ( F and L ) . ( M–P ) Mice were injected with tamoxifen ( 80 mg/kg/day i . p . ) for 5 days , then with TMZ ( 100 mg/kg/day i . p . ) for 3 days , then recovered for 3 or 35 days to observe regeneration . The numbers of labeled GEPCOTs were measured after recombination with Ascl1CreERT2 ( N , 4 mice per condition from two independent experiments ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( O , 5–6 mice per condition from three independent experiments ) , or GFAP-CreERT2 ( P , 4 mice per condition from two independent experiments ) . All data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance was tested with a one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's post-hoc test for the indicated comparisons in B–F and H–L . Statistical significance in N–P was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 008 Consistent with the effects of TMZ on NICs , TMZ treatment also eliminated nearly all GEPCOT cells . 3 days after TMZ treatment , only 10% of the GEPCOTs observed in saline-treated control mice remained in TMZ treated mice ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . By 16 days after TMZ treatment , GEPCOTs recovered to 32% of normal levels ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . GEPCOTs recovered to 55% of normal levels by 90 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . The numbers of pre-GEPCOT cells in the SVZ were not affected by TMZ treatment ( Figure 5F ) . If pre-GEPCOT qNSCs regenerate NICs after TMZ treatment then serial TMZ treatment might be expected to deplete pre-GEPCOT cells . To test this we administered two rounds of TMZ 12 days apart ( Figure 5G ) . Under these circumstances , pre-GEPCOT cells were not depleted 3 days after the second round of TMZ treatment but they were depleted by 90 days after the second round of TMZ ( Figure 5L ) . Consistent with the observation that pre-GEPCOT cells were sensitive to serial TMZ treatment , we detected little recovery of dividing SVZ cells ( Figure 5I ) , NICs ( Figure 5J ) , or GEPCOTs ( Figure 5K ) after serial TMZ treatment . These data suggest that GEPCOT NICs are replenished after ablation by pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . To directly test whether GEPCOTs arise from pre-GEPCOT cells during SVZ regeneration we performed lineage tracing using multiple Cre alleles by first labeling cells with tamoxifen and then treating with TMZ ( Figure 5M ) . After recombination of a conditional reporter with the GEPCOT marker Ascl1CreERT2 , the number of unlabeled GEPCOTs per SVZ increased from 120 ± 50 at 3 days after TMZ to 640 ± 210 at 35 days after TMZ ( p<0 . 01 ) but Ascl1CreERT2-labeled GEPCOTs did not significantly change ( Figure 5N ) . The GEPCOTs , NICs , and neuroblasts that regenerated after TMZ treatment thus did not arise from Ascl1CreERT2-labeled GEPCOTs ( Figure 5N ) . In contrast , after recombination of a conditional reporter with the pre-GEPCOT markers Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 we observed significant ( p<0 . 05 ) increases in the frequencies of labeled GEPCOT cells , NICs , and neuroblasts between 3 and 35 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5O , P ) . These results strongly suggest that pre-GEPCOT cells give rise to GEPCOTs , NICs , and neuroblasts during SVZ regeneration . pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs expressed similar levels of Bmi-1 by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6A ) . To study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs in vivo we generated a floxed allele of Bmi-1 ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A , B ) and conditionally deleted Bmi-1 using Nestin-Cre ( Tronche et al . , 1999 ) . This allele of Nestin-Cre deletes broadly throughout the neuroepithelium by E10 . 5 such that there is nearly homogeneous recombination in the postnatal CNS ( http://cre . jax . org/Nes/Nes-CreNano . html ) . Consistent with this , Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice exhibited a loss of Bmi-1 protein in the cortex and SVZ by western blot ( Figure 6B ) and a loss of Bmi-1 transcripts in SVZ cells , GEPCOT cells , and pre-GEPCOT cells by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 009Figure 6 .

Targeting strategy for engineering a floxed allele of Bmi-1 for conditional deletion . ( A ) A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the mouse Bmi-1 gene ( RP23-145I3 ) , was modified to insert a loxP-FRT-Neo-FRT cassette 5′ to exon 2 and a loxP site 3′ to exon 3 to generate the targeting vector . These sites were selected to avoid disrupting conserved sequences , which are potential regulatory elements . Correctly targeted ES cells ( Bmi1fl-Neo ) were generated using W4 ES cells and identified by southern blotting ( B ) using 5′ and 3′ probes . After generating chimeric mice that gave germline transmission , Bmi1fl-Neo mice were mated with Flp deleter mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) to remove the Neo cassette . The resulting Bmi-1fl mice were backcrossed for at least 10 generations onto a C57BL background . Cre recombination of this allele deletes the start codon and generates a frameshift mutation .

Data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests ( *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 010 Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice were modestly but significantly smaller than littermate controls ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ) . Unlike germline Bmi-1 deficient mice , which generally die within a month after birth ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Lessard and Sauvageau , 2003; Park et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) , we were able to age Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice for up to 2 years . These mice did exhibit neurological deficits that worsened during aging , such as ataxia , as was reported in germline Bmi-1 deficient mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994 ) . However , the survival of Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice throughout adulthood made it possible for the first time to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by qNSCs or NICs in the adult brain . Consistent with the phenotype of germline Bmi-1 deficient mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) , brain morphology appeared relatively normal in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6C , Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ) . Brain size was slightly but significantly reduced in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice as compared to littermate controls ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ) but was normal as a proportion of body mass ( data not shown ) . The cerebellums from Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice were smaller than in control mice and had significantly thinner molecular layers ( Figure 6D , E ) . We also observed unusually prominent GFAP staining throughout the cortex of adult Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1F ) . Otherwise , the olfactory bulb , hippocampus , and cortex appeared grossly normal ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ) , though additional work will be required to carefully assess laminar organization and identity in each brain region . Our data suggest that the smaller cerebellums and prominent GFAP staining reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for Bmi-1 in fetal neural stem/progenitor cells . We observed complete Bmi-1 recombination in sorted SVZ cells , GEPCOT cells , and pre-GEPCOT cells isolated from adult Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6F ) . 12 month-old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice exhibited a significantly reduced number of SVZ cells that incorporated a 2-hr pulse of BrdU ( Figure 6G ) . We measured the rate of neurogenesis in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and Bmi-1fl/fl controls by administering BrdU for 7 days ( beginning at 4 or 14 months of age ) followed by a 4-week chase without BrdU . We quantified the frequency of BrdU+NeuN+ newborn neurons in sections from the olfactory bulb by microscopy . Bmi-1 deletion had no effect on neurogenesis at 4 months of age , but significantly reduced olfactory bulb neurogenesis in 14-month-old mice ( Figure 6H , p<0 . 01 ) . Neurospheres formed by Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl SVZ cells were significantly smaller than control neurospheres ( Figure 6I ) , were unable to undergo multilineage differentiation ( Figure 6J ) , and could not be passaged ( Figure 6K ) . In contrast , control neurospheres readily underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 6J ) and were able to generate multipotent daughter neurospheres upon subcloning into secondary cultures ( Figure 6K ) . To assess whether Bmi-1 deficiency affected pre-GEPCOT qNSCs or GEPCOT NICs in vivo we assessed the frequencies of these cells in SVZs from 4 and 12 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls . The frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells was significantly reduced at 4 months of age ( Figure 6L ) . We observed no significant effects on the frequencies of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 6M ) or neuroblasts ( Figure 6N ) at 4 months of age . However , each of these populations was significantly depleted in 12 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6L–N ) . Bmi-1 is thus required for the maintenance of normal numbers of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs in the adult brain . Nonetheless , some pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neurogenesis did persist for at least a year in adult mice , demonstrating that NSCs are not absolutely dependent upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance in the adult brain . Bmi-1 promotes the maintenance of neural stem cells partly by repressing the Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a/p19Arf ) locus ( Jacobs et al . , 1999; Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007 ) . We were unable to detect Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in wild-type SVZ cells , pre-GEPCOT qNSCs , or GEPCOT NICs in 4-month-old ( 0/5 ) or 12 month old ( 0/5 ) mice ( Figure 6O ) . In contrast , 4-month old Bmi-1-deficient SVZ cells ( 5/5 mice ) and pre-GEPCOT cells ( 4/5 mice ) did express Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) and the level of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression significantly increased between 4 and 12 months of age ( Figure 6O; detected in 5/5 mice for both populations ) . Low level Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression was detected in GEPCOT cells from two of five 4 month-old Bmi-1-deficient mice and in GEPCOT cells from one of five 12 month old Bmi-1-deficient mice ( Figure 6O ) . Bmi-1 is thus required to repress Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . To conditionally delete Bmi-1 in the adult brain we used Nestin-CreERT2 , which deletes broadly throughout the SVZ , including within qNSCs that give rise to SVZ cells after AraC treatment ( Giachino and Taylor , 2009 ) . We observed significantly lower levels of Nestin transcripts within pre-GEPCOT qNSCs as compared to GEPCOT NICs ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) and only 9 . 3 ± 7 . 3% of pre-GEPCOTs stained positively for Nestin protein as compared to 89 . 7 ± 8 . 5% of GEPCOTs and 39 . 0 ± 5 . 3% of SVZ cells ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B ) . We also observed higher levels of Nestin transgene expression in GEPCOT cells as compared to pre-GEPCOT cells , including Nestin-mCherry and Nestin-GFP ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1C , D ) . However , when we analyzed recombination of a conditional reporter in Nestin-CreERT2 mice , we observed labeling of 99 ± 1 . 1% of GEPCOT cells and 96 ± 1 . 9% of pre-GEPCOT cells ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1E ) . Therefore , although endogenous Nestin is expressed at lower levels in qNSCs as compared to NICs , Nestin second intronic enhancer transgenes are variably expressed in both pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs , and Nestin-CreERT2 gives nearly complete recombination in both cell populations . We administered tamoxifen in the chow of Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls for 30 days beginning at 6 weeks of age and assessed recombination efficiency 2 weeks after completing tamoxifen treatment ( i . e . , starting at 3 months of age ) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis of genomic DNA from individual neurospheres revealed complete deletion of Bmi-1 in at least 95% of neurospheres ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2A , B ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated a near total loss of Bmi-1 protein from neurospheres ( Figure 7A ) , consistent with the high rate of recombination in individual neurospheres . By PCR analysis of genomic DNA we observed near complete recombination in unfractionated SVZ cells and complete recombination in pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells isolated from adult Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 7B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 011Figure 7 .

To assess the consequences of Bmi-1 deletion from adult neural stem/progenitor cells , we measured the rate of neurogenesis in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and Bmi-1fl/fl controls by administering BrdU for 7 days ( beginning at 2 weeks , 6 months and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , at which time the mice were approximately 3 months old , 9 months old and 15 months old , respectively ) followed by a 4-week chase without BrdU . Bmi-1 deficiency had no effect on the frequency of BrdU+NeuN+ newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment but significantly reduced neurogenesis 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen ( Figure 7C , p<0 . 05 ) . The reduced neurogenesis in Bmi-1 mutant mice was evident in all subsets of neurons that we investigated , including BrdU+Calretinin+ neurons , BrdU+Calbindin+ neurons , and BrdU+Tyrosine Hydroxylase+ neurons ( Figure 7D , E ) . Bmi-1 is therefore required in adult neural stem/progenitor cells for normal neurogenesis but Bmi-1 deficiency did not completely eliminate the generation of forebrain neurons during the first year of life . Consistent with prior studies , the vast majority of the newborn cells in the adult olfactory bulb were neurons , but the small numbers of astrocytes that arose in the olfactory bulb and oligodendrocytes that arose in the cortex were also diminished after Bmi-1 deletion . The frequency of newborn olfactory bulb BrdU+S100β+ astrocytes appeared normal 6 months after tamoxifen treatment but was significantly reduced 12 months after tamoxifen in Bmi-1 mutant mice ( Figure 7F ) . The frequency of newborn cortical BrdU+GST-pi+ oligodendrocytes declined 6 months after tamoxifen treatment and could no longer be detected after 12 months ( Figure 7G ) . The deficits in neurogenesis and gliogenesis became worse over time after Bmi-1 deletion . We quantified the frequency of SVZ cells that incorporated a 2-hr pulse of BrdU . Bmi-1 mutant mice had significant reductions in the frequencies of BrdU+ SVZ cells at 2 weeks ( 50% reduction , p<0 . 02 ) , 6 months ( 55% reduction , p<0 . 02 ) and 12 months ( 90% reduction , p<0 . 001 ) after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7H ) . Bmi-1 mutant mice also had significant ( p<0 . 001 ) reductions in the frequencies of Mcm2+ ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2E , G ) and Ki67+ ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2F ) SVZ cells . Consistent with this , Bmi-1 mutant mice exhibited significant ( p<0 . 001 ) declines in the frequencies of Dcx+ ( Figure 7I ) and CD24midPSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts ( Figure 7J ) 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment . To assess whether Bmi-1 is required by adult NICs we plated SVZ cells from tamoxifen-treated Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl and control mice in non-adherent cultures and assessed GEPCOT cell frequency . 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment the frequencies of NICs ( Figure 7K ) and GEPCOTs ( Figure 7Q ) were unchanged in Bmi-1 mutant mice as compared to littermate controls . However , the Bmi-1-deficient neurospheres were significantly smaller than control neurospheres ( Figure 7L , M ) and did not undergo multilineage differentiation ( Figure 7N; they formed only astrocytes upon transfer to adherent cultures ) or self-renew upon subcloning ( Figure 7O ) . At 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , Bmi-1 deficient SVZ cells formed virtually no neurospheres ( Figure 7K ) . Consistent with this , Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice also had significantly lower frequencies of GEPCOTs than control mice at 6 months and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , and the magnitude of the depletion increased over time ( Figure 7Q ) . Virtually no GEPCOTs could be found in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 12 months after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7Q ) . These data demonstrate that GEPCOT NICs require Bmi-1 in vivo for their maintenance in the adult SVZ , though the cells are able to persist for several months after Bmi-1 deletion before they are completely eliminated . To test whether qNSCs depend upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance in vivo we examined the frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells in tamoxifen-treated Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls . pre-GEPCOT cells were not depleted at 2 weeks or 6 months after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7P ) . We observed a clear trend toward reduced pre-GEPCOT cell frequency in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 12 months after tamoxifen treatment but the effect was not statistically significant . To test whether there was a loss of Bmi-1 function in these cells we performed qRT-PCR to assess Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice . One mechanism by which Bmi-1 promotes the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cells is by negatively regulating Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression ( Jacobs et al . , 1999; Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) . We did not detect Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in wild-type SVZ cells , pre-GEPCOT qNSCs , or GEPCOT NICs 2 weeks ( 0/5 ) , 3 months ( 0/6 ) , or 8 months ( 0/7 ) after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7R ) . We rarely detected Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 2 weeks ( 0/5 SVZ , 0/5 GEPCOT ) , 3 months ( 0/5 SVZ , 1/5 GEPCOT ) or 8 months ( 1/9 SVZ , 0/9 GEPCOT ) after tamoxifen treatment . Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts were rarely detected in pre-GEPCOT cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 2 weeks ( 0/5 ) or 3 months ( 1/5 ) after tamoxifen treatment . However , 8 months after tamoxifen treatment Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression was detected in pre-GEPCOT cells from seven of nine Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 7R , Figure 7—figure supplement 2H ) . These data demonstrate that Bmi-1 is required during adulthood to negatively regulate Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT qNSCs but that these cells are depleted more slowly than GEPCOT NICs in the adult SVZ . Although high levels of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression are associated with cellular senescence , we were unable to detect any increase in senescence associated β-galactosidase activity in pre-GEPCOT cells from 14 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice or in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from Bmi-1 germline deficient mice ( data not shown ) .\nBy screening almost 400 antibodies against distinct cell surface antigens we identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ ( Figure 8 ) . GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs ( Figure 1C ) and highly mitotically active in vivo ( Figure 1D ) but persisted only transiently in the SVZ based on fate mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 or Dlx1CreERT2 ( Figure 2B , C ) . In contrast , pre-GEPCOT cells lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture ( Figure 4B ) , and were quiescent in vivo ( Figure 4C ) but were long-lived in the SVZ based on fate mapping with the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , GFAP-CreERT2 ( Giachino et al . , 2013 ) , Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) , and Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Lee et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 4F–J ) . In contrast to GEPCOT NICs , pre-GEPCOT cells were resistant to TMZ ( Figure 5E , F ) . Although TMZ eliminated virtually all NICs from the SVZ ( Figure 5D ) , the dividing cells , NICs , and GEPCOTs regenerated within a month of TMZ treatment ( Figure 5 ) . The persistence of pre-GEPCOT cells after TMZ ( Figure 5F ) , and the regeneration of GEPCOTs from a precursor that expresses Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 but not Ascl1CreERT2 ( Figure 5N–P ) suggest that the SVZ regenerates from pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 014Figure 8 . Phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs . GlasthighEGFR−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− pre-GEPCOT cells are a quiescent , TMZ resistant population containing qNSCs that give rise to GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− GEPCOT cells that are highly mitotically active in vivo and enriched for NICs . pre-GEPCOT cells include Type B1 cells , GEPCOT cells include Type C cells , and neuroblasts make up Type A SVZ cells ( Doetsch et al . , 1997; Doetsch et al . , 1999a ) . Bars for different Cre alleles represent the extent of recombination observed after 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen treatment followed by a 2 day chase . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 014 The conclusion that pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs is also supported by the sustained contribution of GFAP-CreERT2 marked cells to the SVZ , as GFAP-CreERT2 labeled many pre-GEPCOT cells but few GEPCOT cells or NICs immediately after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 3A , Figure 4I ) . Thus , our data demonstrate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombination is a marker of qNSCs that survive treatment with anti-mitotic agents and contribute to an increasing proportion of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neuroblasts over time ( Figures 4I and 5M–P ) . NSCs are commonly estimated to account for a few percent of cells in germinal zones in the adult mouse brain ( Doetsch et al . , 1997; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . Although pre-GEPCOT cells accounted for 6 ± 3% of SVZ cells , this population is likely to be heterogeneous , consistent with its heterogeneous GFAP expression ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , the actual frequency of qNSCs in the SVZ may be lower than 6% . The current lack of a clonal assay for qNSCs makes it impossible to test the purity of this population . In an effort to identify culture conditions permissive for colony formation by pre-GEPCOT cells we screened 36 different growth factors or medium supplements but none significantly increased colony formation by SVZ cells from normal or TMZ-treated mice ( Supplementary file 1B ) . Thus , future studies will be required to develop culture conditions that permit efficient colony formation by individual qNSCs and to isolate these cells at high purity . An interesting question for future studies will be whether there are regional differences in the distributions or properties of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs or GEPCOT NICs within the SVZ , corresponding to regional differences in stem/progenitor cell properties ( Merkle et al . , 2007 , 2014; Ihrie et al . , 2011 ) . Germline deficiency for the polycomb family member Bmi-1 eliminates multipotent NICs and reduces proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Zencak et al . , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . However , the lack of a floxed allele of Bmi-1 , the death of germline Bmi-1-deficient mice before adulthood , and the lack of prospective markers for NSCs made it impossible to directly test whether Bmi-1 was required for the maintenance of adult NSCs in vivo . Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 from the fetal and adult SVZ using Nestin-Cre ( Figure 6 ) and Nestin-CreERT2 ( Figure 7 ) demonstrated that pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs require Bmi-1 to be maintained in normal numbers in the adult forebrain , but the depletion of these cells and the loss of neurogenesis occurred much more gradually than expected . Even when Bmi-1 was completely deleted in neural stem/progenitor cells during fetal development , normal or near-normal numbers of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and SVZ neuroblasts were found in the SVZ of 4 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6L–N ) . This demonstrates that pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs can persist throughout fetal and postnatal development , and into adulthood , in the absence of Bmi-1 . This suggests that qNSCs and NICs are less acutely dependent upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance than expected based on studies of Bmi-1 germline knockout mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . There are likely several reasons why Bmi-1 germline knockout mice appeared to exhibit a more severe loss of neural stem/progenitor cells and neurogenesis than is evident in conditional knockout mice . First , the phenotype in Bmi-1 germline knockout mice may indeed be more severe as non-cell-autonomous effects of Bmi-1 deficient stroma contribute to stem cell deficits in these mice ( Oguro et al . , 2006 , 2010 ) . Second , the death of Bmi-1 germline knockout mice before young adulthood meant that adult phenotypes could not be studied directly and it was assumed that the deficits observed in the early postnatal period would rapidly worsen over time . Third , without the ability to prospectively identify qNSCs or NICs in vivo , these cells could only be studied based on neurosphere formation in culture . Since p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression are induced to a greater extent in culture than in vivo , the severity of Bmi-1 deficiency phenotypes in the nervous system are sometimes exaggerated in culture ( Molofsky et al . , 2005; He et al . , 2009 ) . Our data indicate that Bmi-1 is not required for the persistence of NSCs or neurogenesis into adulthood , though both are depleted over time during adulthood after Bmi-1 deletion . Consistent with the gradual depletion of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neurogenesis during adulthood after conditional Bmi-1 deletion , we also observed a gradual increase in Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT cells but not in GEPCOT cells ( Figures 6O and 7R , Figure 7—figure supplement 2H ) . This suggests that qNSCs are particularly dependent upon Bmi-1 for the repression of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression . The identification of markers that prospectively identify and isolate distinct populations of qNSCs and NICs will make it possible to characterize their properties in vivo rather than relying upon colony-forming assays in culture . Use of commercially available antibodies against cell surface antigens will enable such studies in a wide range of genetic backgrounds . Our data on Bmi-1 demonstrate how the existence of these markers makes it possible to assess the function of gene products within the neural stem/progenitor cell pool with a more granular appreciation for effects on qNSCs vs NICs .\nC57Bl/6 were maintained in standard cages with water and standard diet ( Teklad 2916 ) ad libitum . Rosa26CAG-loxp-Stop-loxp-tdTomato ( Ai14 ) ( referred to here as Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato ) ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005 ) , Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) , Dlx1CreERT2 ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Tg ( Slc1a3-CreERT ) ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , Tg ( Nestin-Cre ) ( Tronche et al . , 1999 ) and Tg ( Ubc-GFP ) ( Schaefer et al . , 2001 ) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . Tg ( GFAP-CreERT2 ) ( Hirrlinger et al . , 2006 ) mice were provided by Frank Kirchhoff . Tg ( Nestin-GFP ) ( Birbrair et al . , 2011 ) and Tg ( Nestin-mCherry ) ( Ding et al . , 2012 ) mice were kindly provided by Grigori Enikopalov . Tg ( Nestin-CreERT2 ) mice were provided by G Fishell ( Balordi and Fishell , 2007 ) . Ascl1CreERT2 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) mice were housed in the Johnson laboratory . All mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/Ka background for at least three generations prior to analysis . For BrdU pulses up to 24 hr , 100 mg of BrdU/kg body mass dissolved in PBS was injected i . p . every 6 hours . For 2-week pulses of BrdU , mice were initially injected with 100 mg of BrdU/kg body mass then maintained on drinking water that contained 1 mg/ml BrdU until sacrifice . Targeting vectors to generate Bmi1fl mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) were constructed by recombineering ( Liu et al . , 2003 ) . W4 ES cells were electroporated with the targeting vector and positive clones identified by southern blotting were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J mice . The resulting male chimeric mice were bred to female C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J mice to obtain germline transmission . The FRT-Neo-FRT cassette was removed by crossing with Flp deleter mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) , and then Bmi1fl mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/Ka background for at least 10 generations . Animal protocols were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals and the UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( protocol# 2011-0104 ) . Tamoxifen ( T5648; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was dissolved in 90% corn oil/10% ethanol at 20 mg/ml , and injected at 80 mg/kg/day i . p . for 5 consecutive days into 8–12 week-old mice , then the mice were chased for 2 , 7 , 28 , or 60 days until analysis . For Bmi-1 experiments , tamoxifen citrate ( Sigma or Spectrum Chemical , New Brunswick , NJ ) was given in chow at 400 mg/kg with 5% sucrose ( Harlan ) to 6 week-old mice for 30 days . Mice were then fed a standard diet for at least 14 days before analysis . TMZ ( T2577; Sigma ) was dissolved in 25% DMSO/75% 0 . 9% saline solution at 10 mg/ml by heating briefly to 90–100°C , then shaking and rapidly cooling . Mice were injected at 100 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days then allowed to recover for 3–90 days before analysis . Mice with enlarged spleen or thymus ( sometimes present at 90 days after TMZ treatment ) were excluded from analysis . SVZs from adult ( 8–60 week old ) mice were dissected as described ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2010 ) . SVZs were minced and digested with 300 µl of trypsin solution ( Ca and Mg-free HBSS , 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 25 mg/ml trypsin ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , 10 μg/ml DNase I ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , pH 7 . 6 ) at 37°C for 20 min . Digestion was quenched with three volumes of staining medium ( 440 ml Leibovitz L-15 medium , 50 ml water , 5 ml 1M HEPES pH 7 . 3–7 . 4 , 5 ml 100x Pen-Strep , 20 ml 77 . 7 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 [prepared from Na2H2EDTA] , 1 g bovine serum albumin [A7030; Sigma] ) containing 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor ( T6522; Sigma ) and 10 μg/ml DNase I ( Roche ) . Digested SVZ pieces were centrifuged ( 220×g , 4 min , 4°C ) then fresh staining medium was added and the pieces were triturated in 300 μl by gently drawing into a P1000 pipetman and expelling 25 times without forming bubbles . The cell suspension was then filtered through a 45-micron mesh , counted on a hemocytometer , and added to culture or processed for flow cytometry . Neurosphere formation , self-renewal , and differentiation assays were performed as described previously ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Nishino et al . , 2008 ) , except that in some cases 10 μM Y-27632 hydrochloride ( Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor; Tocris Biosciences 1254 , Bristol , UK ) and 20 ng/ml IGF-1 ( 291-G1; R&D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) were also added to the culture medium because they were found to promote clonogenesis after sorting adult SVZ cells ( data not shown ) . For adherent colony formation , Tg ( Ubc-GFP ) SVZ cells were co-cultured with ∼80–90% confluent nontransgenic neonatal SVZ-derived astrocytes isolated and passaged twice prior to the experiment . GFP fluorescence was used to assess colony formation after 12–20 days in culture . For screening for markers of NICs , typically SVZs from 5–10 mice were pooled and stained with antibodies then analyzed using a 4 laser FACSAria III ( Becton Dickenson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Markers that stained SVZ cells heterogeneously were used to separate SVZ cells by flow cytometry into different fractions then sorted into non-adherent cultures to measure the frequency of NICs . To stain SVZ cells with the combination of markers used to isolate GEPCOT or pre-GEPCOT cells , dissociated SVZ cells were centrifuged ( 220×g , 4 min , 4°C ) and resuspended in 100 μl staining medium per brain . Then the following antibodies were added: BV421 anti-Ter119 ( 116233; 1/100; Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) , BV421 anti-CD45 ( 103133; 1/100; Biolegend ) , APC-eFluor 780 anti-CD24 ( 47-0242-82; 1/200; eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) , 5A5 ascites ( anti-PSA-NCAM; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA , 1/100 ) , O4 ascites ( 1/200 ) , anti-PlexinB2 ( 14-5665-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , biotinylated anti-EGFR ( BAF1280 , 1/200; R&D Systems ) , anti-Glast ( 130-095-822; 1/10; Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) , and DAPI ( 50 μg/ml , 1/100 ) . After adding antibodies , the cells were incubated on ice for 45 min , then washed with 2 . 5 ml fresh staining medium and pelleted ( 220g for 4 min at 4°C ) and resuspended in secondary antibodies . Typically we used the following combination: APC anti-mouse IgG2a ( 115-135-206; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) , PE anti-hamster IgG ( 127-115-160; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch ) , PE-Cy7 anti-mouse IgM ( 25-5790-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , BV605-Streptavidin ( 563260; 1/200; BD Biosciences ) . However when analyzing mice expressing tdTomato we used the following alternative secondary antibodies: PerCP-eFluor 710 anti-mouse IgG ( 46-4010-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , APC anti-hamster IgG ( 127-135-160; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch ) , PE-Cy7 anti-mouse IgM ( 25-5790-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , BV605-Streptavidin ( 563260; 1/200; BD Biosciences ) . Cells were stained with secondary antibodies on ice for 45 min , then washed and pelleted as above , and analyzed on the FACSAria in a volume of 200 μl per brain . When sorting cells onto slides , a drop of 8 μl staining medium was placed on a SuperFrost Plus slide , and 100–300 cells were sorted directly into the drop . The slide was then kept humid for 45–60 min at ambient temperature to allow the cells to attach to the glass , then the cells were fixed with 4% PFA ( 20 min , RT ) . Cells were then permeabilized and stained with rat anti-BrdU ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA , clone Bu1/75 , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , mouse anti-Nestin ( BD clone Rat-401 , 1/100 after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , and rabbit anti-GFAP ( Dako , Carpinteria , CA , 1/3000 ) antibodies using standard techniques . Brains were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA in PBS , then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 1–3 days at 4°C , then frozen in OCT or cryogel on dry ice after 3–12 hr equilibration at 4°C . Sections were cut at 12 μm thickness spanning the rostral half of the SVZ ( typically 6 sections per slide ) or the entire olfactory bulb ( typically 8 sections per slide ) . Sections were immunostained with the following primary antibodies: rat anti-BrdU ( Abcam clone Bu1/75 , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , guinea pig anti-Dcx ( 1/1000; Millipore ) , mouse anti-Mcm2 ( BD Biosciences , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , rat anti-Ki67 ( 1/500; eBioscience ) , mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase ( 1/1000; Millipore ) , rabbit anti-calretinin ( 1/1000; Sigma ) , rabbit anti-calbindin ( 1/500; Millipore ) , rabbit anti-S100β ( 1/1000; Dako ) , rabbit anti-GST-pi ( 1/3000; Enzo , Farmingdale , NY ) , and mouse anti-NeuN ( 1/1000; Millipore ) . Fixed whole-mount SVZs were stained with mouse anti-acetylated tubulin ( 1/1000; Sigma ) , rabbit anti-β-catenin ( 1/500; Sigma ) , mouse anti-GFAP ( 1/3000; Sigma ) , and goat anti-EGFR ( 1/250; R&D Systems ) . Alexa Fluor 488- , 555- , and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies were used ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were resuspended in 10% trichloracetic acid ( TCA , Sigma ) . Extracts were incubated on ice for at least 15 min and centrifuged at 16 , 100×g at 4°C for 15 min . Precipitates were washed in acetone twice and dried . The pellets were solubilized in 9M urea , 2% Triton X-100 , and 1% DTT . LDS loading buffer ( Invitrogen ) was added and the pellet was heated at 70°C for 10 min . Samples were separated on Bis-Trispolyacrylamide gels ( Invitrogen ) and transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore or BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . Membranes were treated with the SuperSignal Western Blot Enhancer ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescence kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . Blots were stripped with 1% SDS , 25 mM glycine ( pH 2 ) prior to reprobing . The following primary antibodies were used for western blots: β-Actin ( AC-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , Bmi-1 ( F6; Millipore ) . Cells were sorted directly into RLT plus buffer ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol . RNA was extracted with the RNeasy micro plus kit ( Qiagen ) and cDNA was synthesized with the RT2 First Strand Kit ( Qiagen ) . Reactions were run in 20 μl volumes with SYBR green and a LightCycler 480 ( Roche Applied Science ) . Primer sequences were: Bmi-1 F ( Figures 6A ) , 5′-CCAATGGCTCCAATGAAGACC-3′ , Bmi-1 R ( Figures 6A ) , 5′-TTGCTGCTGGGCATCGTAAG-3′ , Bmi-1 F ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) , 5′-CGCTCTTTCCGGGATCTTT-3′ , Bmi-1 R ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) , 5′-CTCCACACAGGACACACATTA-3′ , Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) F , 5′-GTGTGCATGACGTGCGGG-3′ , Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) R , 5′-GCAGTTCGAATCTGCACCGTAG-3′; β-actin F , 5′-CGTCGACAACGGCTCCGGCATG-3′; β-actin R , 5′-GGGCCTCGTCACCCACATAGGAG-3′; Nestin F 5′-GGGCCCAGAGCTTTCCCACG-3′; Nestin R 5′-GGGCATGCACCAGACCCTGTG-3′ . Neurosphere assays were done as previously published by our lab ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2005; Nishino et al . , 2008 ) . However when sorting adult SVZ cells for neurosphere assays several important technical points require attention:",
         "Neurons that arise in the adult nervous system originate from neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells . Neural stem cells have long lives , much of which they spend in a quiescent state . Neural stem cells can also give rise to neural progenitor cells , which proliferate rapidly during their short lives and then ‘differentiate’ into neurons or glia . Unlike some other tissues , it has not been possible to identify or purify neural stem cells directly from the tissue . Consequently , neural stem and progenitor cells have usually been studied retrospectively , based on their ability to form colonies in laboratory cell cultures . A region of the brain called the subventricular zone contains both neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells , and is one of only two regions of the brain where neural stem cells are found in adult mammals . When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around ( rather than growing on a surface ) , a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres . Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia , the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells . However , the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain . Now , Mich , Signer et al . have used a technique called flow cytometry to identify and isolate neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells directly from the subventricular zone . The neural stem cells , which Mich , Signer et al . term pre-GEPCOT cells ( based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells ) , were long-lived and quiescent , but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture . The neurosphere-forming cells , named GEPCOT cells , were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain . These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all , and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions . The identification of undifferentiated pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells will make it possible to directly study the properties of these cells inside the mouse brain , and to isolate live cells to test how they function . The results also highlight the need for new tests to study neural stem cell function , given that current tests using neurospheres do not detect stem cells as commonly assumed .",

         "Cellular heterogeneity hinders the extraction of functionally significant results and inference of regulatory networks from wide-scale expression profiles of complex mammalian organs . The mammalian inner ear consists of the auditory and vestibular systems that are each composed of hair cells , supporting cells , neurons , mesenchymal cells , other epithelial cells , and blood vessels . We developed a novel protocol to sort auditory and vestibular tissues of newborn mouse inner ears into their major cellular components . Transcriptome profiling of the sorted cells identified cell type–specific expression clusters . Computational analysis detected transcription factors and microRNAs that play key roles in determining cell identity in the inner ear . Specifically , our analysis revealed the role of the Zeb1/miR-200b pathway in establishing epithelial and mesenchymal identity in the inner ear . Furthermore , we detected a misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway in the inner ear of Twirler mice , which manifest , among other phenotypes , malformations of the auditory and vestibular labyrinth . The association of misregulation of the ZEB1/miR-200b pathway with auditory and vestibular defects in the Twirler mutant mice uncovers a novel mechanism underlying deafness and balance disorders . Our approach can be employed to decipher additional complex regulatory networks underlying other hearing and balance mouse mutants .\nGenome-wide expression profiling is a valuable tool for gaining systems-level understanding of biological processes during development , response to stress , and pathological conditions . However , accurate interpretation of expression profiles from complex tissues such as neuroepithelia is often complicated and hindered by cellular heterogeneity . Such cellular complexity has made it particularly difficult to identify relevant transcriptional networks from the auditory and vestibular systems of mammalian inner ears , which are composed of hair cells , multiple types of supporting cells , neurons , mesenchymal cells and vascular endothelium . Hereditary hearing loss ( HHL ) is a common congenital sensory disability , affecting 1 in 2000 newborns and a significant portion of the elderly population . The complexity of the auditory and vestibular systems is reflected in over 250 genes which , when mutated , underlie inner ear malformations or dysfunction in mice ( http://hearingimpairment . jax . org/master_table . html ) . Furthermore , there are over 118 syndromes that include hearing loss as part of their phenotype [1] , and over 100 genes – roughly half of which have been cloned which underlie hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss in human ( http://hereditaryhearingloss . org/ ) and [2] . The human and mouse inner ears are remarkably similar and the mouse has proven to be an invaluable tool in the study of hearing loss [3] . Nevertheless , cell type–specific molecular differences between the auditory and vestibular systems , and the signaling cascades upstream and downstream of most of the deafness genes have not been fully deciphered . In this study we demonstrate the utility of endogenously expressed cell surface markers for separating the auditory and vestibular tissues into their major cellular components . We used a cell type–specific transcriptome analysis to identify regulators of cell fate determination in the inner ear . Finally , utilizing the example of the ZEB1/miR-200b pathway , we present a proof-of-concept that cell type–specific gene expression profiles can be used to identify molecular pathways upstream and downstream of deafness genes .\nOur first goal was to develop a protocol for dissociating the inner ear sensory tissues into their major cellular components . We studied the ears of newborn mice to increase the likelihood of identifying genes that are important both for early and terminal differentiation of the inner ear . To identify antibodies that could be used to sort the inner ear into its major cellular compartments , we stained inner ears of P0 wild-type mice with commercially available monoclonal antibodies to the protein products of cell surface cluster of differentiation ( CD ) genes that are expressed in the ear [4] . We found that CD326 ( EpCAM ) is detected in all sensory and non-sensory epithelial cells of the mouse inner ear ( Figure 1A ) . For the purpose of this manuscript , we define the cochlear sensory epithelium as the hair cells , supporting cells and cells of the greater and lesser epithelial ridges ( i . e . epithelial cells that are not part of the stria vascularis or Reissner's membrane ) , and the vestibular sensory epithelium as hair cells and supporting cells . In contrast to CD326 , the epithelial staining of CD49f ( Integrin α6 ) is specific to the sensory epithelial cells . Within the non-epithelial cells , CD49f stains the neuronal and vascular endothelial cells . Finally , antibodies against CD34 , a cell surface protein that is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and vascular endothelium [5] , specifically and uniquely stain the vascular endothelium in the inner ear . We postulated that inner ear cells can be divided into epithelial and non-epithelial cells based on the expression of CD326 and further divided into sensory epithelial , non-sensory epithelial , neuronal , vascular endothelial and mesenchymal cells based on the expression of CD49f and CD34 ( Figure 1B ) . Flow cytometric analysis of microdissected and dissociated tissues from the auditory and vestibular organs of postnatal day 0 to 1 ( P0-P1 ) wild-type mice revealed a clear separation of vascular endothelial , mesenchymal , neuronal and epithelial cells . Sensory epithelial cells could be distinguished from non-sensory epithelial cells , forming a total of five cellular populations ( Figure 1C , Figure S1A ) . Notably , the proportions of specific populations differed between the auditory and vestibular tissues . For example , the proportion of vascular endothelial cells is greater than three-fold higher in the vestibular tissues compared with the cochlea ( p = 0 . 006 , Figure S1B ) . As we could sort up to four cellular populations simultaneously , we decided to focus our experiments on a total of eight cellular populations – sensory epithelial , neuronal , vascular endothelial and mesenchymal cells from the auditory and vestibular organs . To further test the purity of the sorted cells , total RNA was extracted from each of the eight sorted populations and semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using primers for the RNA transcripts encoding CD326 , CD49f and CD34 . All sorted cells showed 100- to 1000-fold enrichment for the mRNA that encode the markers used to sort their respective populations , supporting the molecular purity of the sorted populations ( Figure S1C ) . We obtained wide-scale expression profiles of total RNA extracted from sensory epithelial , neuronal , mesenchymal and vascular endothelial cells of the auditory and vestibular tissues of newborn wild-type mice ( a total of eight populations ) . We used the Illumina mouse expression arrays with probes for the majority of RefSeq-annotated genes ( >24 , 000 genes ) , and over 7 , 000 predicted genes to generate eight ‘cell-type specific’ transcriptomes . We generated biologically independent triplicates for each cellular population , yielding a dataset of 24 independent transcriptomes . In the first step of the analysis of this dataset , we examined the overall similarity relations between the 24 transcriptome profiles . To accomplish this goal we subjected the profiles to hierarchical clustering which orders them in the structure of a hierarchical tree ( dendrogram ) in which similar transcriptomes are close to each other , while disparate ones are far apart in the tree . Our dataset's dendrogram clearly contains four main branches corresponding to the four cell types from which expression profiles were obtained ( Figure 2A ) . This structure indicates that the characteristics of the transcriptomes primarily correspond to cell type rather than tissue from which they were obtained . Interestingly , sensory epithelial cells , but not other cell types from the auditory and vestibular tissues , were distinguished by sub-branches . This is consistent with the differentiated and specific functional characteristics of the sensory epithelium in auditory versus vestibular organs . We next examined the dataset for genes whose expression varied significantly among the eight sorted cell populations . Two-way ANOVA tests [6] detected more than 3 , 000 differentially expressed genes ( p<10−5 , FDR<1% , Table S1 ) . We then applied a clustering analysis which distributed these differentially expressed genes into sets based upon distinctive expression patterns [7] . Consistent with the hierarchical clustering results , the major clusters which were found in our dataset showed symmetric patterns of expression between the auditory and vestibular systems in the vast majority of clusters ( Figure 2B and Table S2 ) . For example , the largest clusters contained genes that were highly expressed in the vascular endothelium ( cluster #1 , 754 genes ) or sensory epithelial cells ( cluster #2 , 534 genes ) , in both the auditory and vestibular organs . In contrast , cluster #7 ( 126 genes ) contained genes that were highly expressed only in the auditory sensory cells but not in the corresponding cell population in the vestibular system . To correlate the observed cellular transcriptomes with biological functions , we searched for enrichment of Gene-Ontology ( GO ) functional groups in each of the clusters [8] . All cell type–specific clusters were significantly enriched for functional categories that corresponded with the known roles of the cells ( Figure 2D ) . For example , the clusters that contained genes highly expressed in vascular endothelial , sensory or neuronal cells were significantly enriched for genes which function in ‘angiogenesis’ , ‘sensory perception of sound’ or ‘neuron differentiation’ , respectively , further validating the accuracy of our sorting approach . If differential gene expression implies functional significance , then deafness genes should be over represented in the clusters of differentially expressed genes . Forty-four of 66 genes known to underlie hereditary hearing loss ( syndromic or non-syndromic –Table S3 ) were detected as expressed in our dataset . These genes were significantly over-represented 2 . 5-fold in the set of genes differentially expressed between the cell populations studied . Twenty-four ( 55% ) of the deafness genes were differentially expressed in our dataset ( compared with 22% predicted by random distribution , p = 1 . 2*10−6 ) . Furthermore , the distribution of the deafness-related genes was significantly biased towards clusters 2 and 4 which contain genes highly expressed in sensory epithelial or sensory epithelial and mesenchymal cells , respectively ( p = 0 . 00025 , hyper-geometric tail , Figure 2D ) . We reasoned that additional , yet undiscovered , deafness-related genes may have cell type–specific expression patterns that could be detected using our dataset . As a proof of principle , we searched our dataset of gene expression for positional candidate genes in Auditory Neuropathy Locus 1 ( AUNA1 ) [9] . Prior to being cloned , this deafness locus spanned 18 . 3 megabases and contained 47 protein coding genes . Based on our database , 26 of the protein-coding genes were expressed in the ear , however , only two of these genes were selectively expressed in the neuronal cells of the auditory and vestibular systems: Diap3 , whose human ortholog is now known to underlie AUNA1 , and Trim13 ( Figure S2 ) . Hence a cell type–specific expression analysis of AUNA1 could have prioritized two genes for analysis . As functionally related proteins often physically interact , we conducted an integrated analysis to search for groups of genes that both show similar expression patterns in the inner ear and are physically linked in the cellular web of protein-protein interactions [10] . Several expression-interaction modules were identified in our dataset ( Figure 3 and Figure S3 ) . Significantly , Module #7 contained genes highly expressed in sensory cells and was enriched for proteins that function in ‘inner ear morphogenesis’ ( Figure 3B ) . This physically connected network contains two known non-syndromic deafness genes MYO6 ( MIM ID 600970 ) and TMPRSS3 ( MIM ID 605511 ) . We speculated that defects in other proteins in this module could underlie hereditary hearing loss . To identify novel candidates , we correlated the genomic location of the human orthologues of the genes encoding the proteins in this expression-interaction module with the genomic intervals of the deafness loci for which the disease-causing genes are not yet identified . We found that the human orthologues of 15 of the genes in module #7 map to linkage intervals of uncloned deafness loci ( Figure 3C ) . For example , ATP1B1 and NME7 are candidate genes for DFNA7 based both on enrichment in the sensory epithelial cells and their involvement in this protein-protein interaction sub-network ( Figure 3C , marked with asterisks ) . For ten of the deafness loci , our analysis identified candidate genes that are connected to known deafness genes by the protein-protein interaction network ( Table S4 ) . With the increased use of whole-exome sequencing to clone deafness genes , cell type–specific expression patterns can provide valuable information , specifically when multiple changes are seen within a single linkage interval . Expression of miRNAs is essential for the development of the inner ear . Specifically , mutations in miR-96 have recently been found to underlie hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss in humans and mice [11]–[13] . miRNAs modulate the expression of genes by affecting either the translation of mRNA to protein or the stability of mRNAs . Previous studies demonstrate that activity of miRNAs in specific biological conditions can be inferred from comparative analysis of mRNA expression profiles [14] , [15] . The premise of this in silico approach is that each miRNA typically down-regulates the expression of dozens of target mRNAs , thereby leaving a molecular signature on the cellular transcriptome that marks its activity . Significant down-regulation of miRNA targets in a certain cell population therefore implies enhanced activity of that miRNA in the biological condition of interest . Our in silico search for miRNAs detected four candidate families whose predicted targets were depleted in a statistically significant manner in selected cell populations ( Figure 4A ) . Reassuringly , the top-scoring miRNA identified by this analysis was miR-96 . In comparison with other genes , the set of predicted targets of miR-96 was significantly down-regulated in sensory epithelial cells both in the auditory and vestibular systems ( p-value 4 . 64E-11 and 9 . 28E-09 , respectively; Wilcoxon test ) . This bioinformatics analysis pinpointed miR-96 as a major regulator of gene expression in sensory cells of the inner ear , without using any prior knowledge of this organ , and provided a comprehensive list of putative targets of miR-96 in inner ear sensory epithelia ( Table S6 ) . We also found that predicted targets of miR-128 were significantly down-regulated in the neurons of the auditory and vestibular systems , while the predicted targets of miR-9 were significantly down-regulated only in the neurons of the auditory system . Both miR-128 and miR-9 are known to have an important function in neuronal development [16] . Finally , the set of predicted targets of the miR-200b family were significantly down-regulated in sensory cells of the auditory and vestibular systems while being significantly up-regulated in mesenchymal cells . This finding strongly suggests that miR-200b is expressed and active in sensory epithelial cells while its levels are very low in mesenchymal cells of the inner ear , consistent with the documented role of the family of miR-200b in establishing and maintaining an epithelial phenotype of cells . To validate this result , whole mount in-situ hybridizations were performed on newborn inner ears of wild type mice with a probe for miR-200b , as well as a probe for miR-182 ( a miRNA that is expressed in hair cells and ganglion cells of the ear [17] ) as a positive control , and a no-probe negative control . As predicted by the in silico analysis , miR-200b is expressed in all of the sensory epithelial cells of the newborn mouse inner ear , both in the auditory and the vestibular systems ( Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , the expression of miR-200b is epithelial-specific and included both the sensory and non-sensory epithelial cells . In order to identify transcription factors ( TFs ) that determine cell fate in the inner-ear , we applied a bioinformatics approach which , under the assumption that co-expression of transcripts over multiple conditions implies their transcriptional co-regulation , statistically searches for cis-regulatory elements that are over-represented in promoter regions of the sets of co-expressed genes [18] . We applied this approach to the sets of cell-type specific marker genes which were identified by our trasncriptomic analysis ( see Materials and Methods , Figure S4 and Table S5 ) . This de novo motif discovery analysis identified a top scoring motif that was significantly enriched in the set of promoters of the sensory marker genes ( Figure 5A ) , and corresponds to the binding signature of the ZEB1 and ZEB2 transcription factors [19] . ZEB1 and ZEB2 are primarily repressors of transcription [20] . Thus , the enrichment of the ZEB1/2 binding signature in the promoters of sensory marker genes suggests that Zeb1 and Zeb2 are expressed in all cell types except sensory epithelial cells where their targets can be expressed due to lack of suppression . The second statistically significant DNA motif in our dataset was identified in the promoters of genes specifically expressed in vascular endothelial cells and corresponds to the binding signature of the c-Ets-1/2 transcription factors ( Figure 5A ) . c-Ets1 and c-Ets2 are transcriptional activators , and therefore the enrichment of their binding signature in promoters of blood vessel markers suggests that these factors are specifically expressed in blood vessel cells . Examination of the mRNA expression patterns of Zeb1 , Zeb2 , c-Ets1 and c-Ets2 in our dataset confirmed these predictions , showing a depletion of Zeb1 and Zeb2 mRNA from the sensory epithelial cells and an enrichment of c-Ets1 and c-Ets2 mRNA in the vascular endothelial cells ( Figure 5B ) . These results corroborate the computationally-derived hypotheses implicating major roles for Zeb1/Zeb2 and c-Ets1/c-Ets2 in suppressing an epithelial and enhancing a vascular endothelial phenotype , respectively , in the inner ear . To validate the expression of Zeb1 , inner ear sections from newborn wild-type mice were stained with an antibody against Zeb1 [21] , and epithelial cells were labeled with CD326 . As expected , all non-epithelial cells in the auditory and vestibular organs express Zeb1 while none of the epithelial cells show any Zeb1 expression , consistent with our in silico predictions . No expression was detected in the sections stained with the pre-immune serum ( Figure 5C and Figure S5 ) . Thus , our computational analysis identified the miR-200b-ZEB1/2 pathway as a key regulator of epithelial and mesenchymal identities in the inner ear ( Figure 5D ) . Importantly , a major mechanism by which miR-200b achieves this function is direct down-regulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 [22] . Our in situ hybridization results for miR-200b and immunolocalization for Zeb1 confirm that Zeb1 and miR-200b are expressed in mutually exclusive cell populations in the ear . Twirler mutant mice have , among other phenotypes , auditory and vestibular defects [23] . Recently , a single nucleotide change in the first intron of Zeb1 was shown to underlie the phenotype of Twirler [24] . The mutation leads to an up-regulation of Zeb1 RNA and protein [24] , although how this leads to the observed phenotype is still unresolved . We therefore hypothesized that if ZEB1 function is compromised in Twirler mice , many epithelial genes should be de-repressed and abnormally expressed in non-epithelial compartments . To test this hypothesis , auditory and vestibular epithelia were dissected from newborn Tw/Tw mice and their wild type littermate controls , dissociated and sorted into CD326-positive and -negative cells , which in wild type mice represent the epithelial and non-epithelial compartments . We compared the expression levels of the epithelial marker genes in CD326-negative cells of the Tw/Tw mice and their wild type controls . In full accordance with our model , the expression of epithelial markers was strikingly elevated in CD326-negative cells of the Tw/Tw mice ( p = 3 . 7*10−12 for the cochlea and p = 1 . 29*10−15 for the vestibular system , Wilcoxon test ) , consistent with a severe misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway in Twirler inner ear ( Figure 6A ) . Conversely , a relative down-regulation of mesenchymal marker transcripts was identified in the CD326-negative cells of the Tw/Tw mice . We next examined the expression levels of epithelial markers in CD326-positive and negative cells dissected from the auditory and vestibular epithelia of Tw/+ mice . Notably , while Tw/+ mice have vestibular dysfunction associated with structurally abnormal semicircular canals , their hearing impairment is variable and the only observed auditory structural defect is shortening of the cochlear duct [24] . In accordance with the results we obtained for the Tw/Tw mice , the set of epithelial marker genes showed significantly elevated expression in the CD326-negative cells of the Tw/+ vestibular systems compared with wild-type controls although the elevation was not as strong as it was in the Tw/Tw ears ( p = 1 . 8*10−7 and p = 1 . 3*10−15 , respectively , and Figure S6A ) . Tw/+ cochlear ducts showed no significant change in expression of sensory markers , consistent with the incompletely penetrant and mild auditory phenotype in these mice ( Figure S6B and [24] ) . Taken together , the cell type–specific transcriptomes of heterozygous and homozygous Tw auditory and vestibular organs support our hypothesis that the Tw mutation exerts its pathogenic affect via misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway . Many of the epithelial marker genes that were misregulated in the Tw/Tw mice harbor a ZEB1 binding site signature in their promoters ( Figure 6B ) . Interestingly , this group of genes contains several genes that encode for proteins that form the extracellular matrices of the mouse inner ear: Tecta , Tectb , Otog , and Oc90 [25] , [26] . Otogelin , and α- and β tectorins are necessary for proper formation of the tectorial membrane , a gelatinous matrix that covers that apical surface of the hair cells in the cochlea . This matrix contacts the hair cell stereocilia and is important for proper deflection of the stereocilia in response to sound . Otoconin-90 ( Oc90 ) forms part of the organic component of the otoconia , small calcium carbonate-enriched protein matrices that are essential for sensing linear acceleration and gravity by the utricle and saccule , respectively . To validate these results , sections of inner ears from newborn Twirler mice and their littermate controls were stained with antibodies against α-tectorin , otogelin and Oc90 . For all of these proteins , wild type expression was restricted to the epithelial compartment and the resulting extracellular matrices . In contrast , in Twirler mice , multiple cells expressing α-tectorin , Otogelin and Oc90 were found within the non-epithelial compartment , often in clusters ( Figure 6C ) .\nIn this study we developed a protocol to isolate the major cell types of the auditory and vestibular organs of newborn wild type mouse inner ears . We applied this approach to characterize the tissue- and cell type–specific transcriptome of the newborn mouse inner ear , followed by a computational analysis to identify co-expressed genes and regulators of cell fate . The cis-regulatory motif analysis was carried out using a de novo motif discovery tool with no bias to any pre-selected TFs [18] . Searching all possible DNA motifs , the analysis defined only two statistically significant motifs , corresponding to ZEB1/2 ( enriched in promoters of genes whose expression was reduced in sensory cells ) and c-Ets-1/2 ( enriched in promoters of genes whose expression was elevated in blood cells ) . Most of the reported successful analyses using similar approaches were achieved in lower organisms ( primarily yeast ) in which transcriptional regulation is much simpler [27] , [28] . Additional regulators are likely to be identified by sorting the cell types we studied to even more homogeneous subpopulations ( e . g . separating hair cells from supporting cells ) . The strength of this approach is further demonstrated by the ability to detect not only compartment specific regulators of cell fate ( Zeb1/2 , c-Ets1/2 , miR-128 , miR-9 and miR200b ) but also miR-96 , a miRNA which is expressed only in a subset of the sensory epithelial cells . A recent study by Lewis et al . identified putative targets of miR-96 by comparing expression profiles of whole auditory sensory tissues dissected from wild type and miR-96 mutant mice [12] . Interestingly , the miR-96 putative targets identified by Lewis et al . and by our study represent two non-overlapping groups . Further analysis of the cell type–specific expression patterns of these putative targets reveals that while most of the targets identified by Lewis et al . are elevated and co-expressed with miR-96 in the same cell population ( sensory epithelium ) , our analysis identified targets whose expression is reduced in the sensory epithelium ( Figure 7 ) . This is consistent with the two functional effects of repression of targets by miRNAs: repression of leaky transcription , and buffering of transcriptional noise [29] . In the first case , the miRNA and its targets are expressed in mutually exclusive cell types . In the second case , the miRNA functions to reduce fluctuation in the expression of its target due to transcriptional noise , and therefore it is co-expressed with its targets in the same cells . Since miR-96 is expressed in the inner-ear specifically in hair cells and as the hair cells consist of only a small fraction of the total number of cells in this organ , only targets that are hair cell-specific or hair cell-enriched ( and hence targets that belong to the second group ) are likely to be detected when extracting RNA from intact sensory tissues ( for example , tissues that consists of a mix of epithelial and non-epithelial cells , or a mix of hair cells and supporting cells ) as was done by Lewis et al . For the other group of targets , the effect of miR-96 is expected to be diluted by their expression in the other inner-ear compartments . On the other hand , in our study , using a cell type–specific analysis of wild-type inner ears , we could only identify targets of miR-96 that are expressed also outside the sensory epithelial cells ( and hence targets that belong to the first group ) . We hypothesize that repeating the experiment described by Lewis et al . using a cell type–specific approach would likely identify both groups of complementary target genes . We applied our method to analyze ears from Twirler mutant mice to determine if the observed inner ear malformations were associated with a disruption of wild-type cell type–specific gene expression profiles . The results revealed misregulation of epithelial and mesenchymal specific genes in the non-epithelial compartment . This finding is consistent with a misregulation of Zeb1-regulated gene expression in the Twirler mutant mice . Furthermore , a group of genes that encodes the extracellular matrices of the mouse inner ear – Otog , Tecta , Tectb and Oc-90- was upregulated in the non-epithelial cells of the homozygous Twirler inner ears and harbored a binding site for Zeb1 in their promoter , suggesting that they are direct targets of the Zeb1 transcription factor in the developing inner ear mesenchyme . Of note , immunohistochemical analysis of inner ears from Zeb1-null mice [30] and their heterozygous or wild type littermate controls showed very subtle , if any , structural abnormalities in the ears of the Zeb1-null mice ( Data not shown ) . It is possible that Zeb2 may compensate for the loss of Zeb1 in Zeb1-null but not Tw/Tw inner ear mesenchyme . This is consistent with the observation that Tw is not a loss-of-function allele of Zeb1 [24] . The expression profiles of Twirler ears suggest that a pathologic disruption of epithelial and mesenchymal cell identities underlies the inner ear malformations observed in the Twirler mouse mutant , consistent with misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway . This could arise from a loss of mesenchymal cell identity leading to mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( MET ) , a loss of epithelial cell identity leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , or a combination of these mechanisms . The exact mechanism leading to the misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway is still unknown , but likely results from loss of binding of one or more Myb proteins to a binding site disrupted by the Twirler Zeb1 mutation [24] . Therefore , further work is required in order to elucidate the exact mechanism of the Twirler mutation . A limitation of our approach is the utilization of CD326 to separate the epithelial from the non-epithelial compartment in the Twirler mutant mice , as CD326 itself could be regulated by Zeb1 . Nevertheless , we were unable to identify other epithelial markers with a stable pattern of expression to separate epithelial and non-epithelial cells . Ultimately , to prove direct regulation of gene expression by transcription factors , one has to demonstrate protein-DNA interactions . This is specifically challenging when working with tissues or small organs such as the inner ear sensory epithelia . Future development of techniques to perform large-scale whole transcriptome analysis of protein-DNA interactions using small numbers of cells will enable combining cell type–specific approaches with techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ( ChIP-Seq ) [31] . Finally , implementation of our approach to study other mouse models for hearing loss will likely shed light on the molecular mechanisms downstream and upstream of many of the deafness genes .\nAll procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and have been approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Maryland , Baltimore ( protocols 0107005 and 1209008 ) or the joint Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders . Wild type ICR mice were obtained as time-mated animals from Charles River Laboratories ( Maryland ) . Newborn mice were euthanized by decapitation . Whole inner ears were micro-dissected out of the middle cranial fossa following the contour of their cartilaginous capsule , in a 3-cm dish with cold PBS . The tissue was then fixed in 2–4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 4 hours or overnight at 4°C . Cryoprotection was performed in a sucrose gradient ( 5% , 10% , 15% , 20% , 25% in PBS ) , 30 minutes in each step . The tissue was then kept at 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C . The following day , tissue was embedded in optimal cutting temperature ( O . C . T . ) compound ( Tissue-Tek ) and positioned with the lateral aspect of the basal turn of the cochlea at a 90° angle to the surface of a small plastic receptacle . The tissue was then frozen at this position using dry ice and kept in a −80°C freezer until further use . Five-to 7-µm sections were obtained using a Leica CM1850 cryostat and placed on superfrost/Plus slides ( Fisherbrand ) . Sections were kept at −80°C until further use . For immunofluorescence the slides were brought to room temperature and a liquid-repellent marker pen ( Daido Sangyo ) was used to circle the sections . After a 30-min wash with PBS and 0 . 5% Tween-20 , sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum ( NGS ) for 20 min at room temperature . Primary antibody incubation was performed for one hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C . Following three 5-min washes , sections were incubated for 45 minutes with a goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody conjugated either to Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 at room temperature , in the dark . Slides were then washed two times in PBS , cell nuclei were stained by 10-min incubation with DAPI 1 µg/ml ( KPL ) and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E600 upright microscope equipped for brightfield and fluorescence . Images were acquired using a SPOT Diagnostics image acquisition system . Hair cells were counterstained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody for Myosin VI ( Proteus Biosciences ) at 1∶1000 dilution . The following rat monoclonal antibodies were used to detect CD proteins: Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse CD326 ( Ep-CAM ) 1∶100 , PE anti-mouse CD34 ( 1∶200 ) and FITC anti-human/mouse CD49f ( 1∶200 ) ( BioLegend ) . The following antibodies were also used to detect their respective proteins: anti-Zeb1 rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 1∶1000 ) ( Spoelstra et al . , 2006 ) , anti-OC90 ( 1∶200 ) [32] , anti-Otog ( 1∶1000 ) [33] ( gifts from Dr . Christine Petit ) and anti-tectorin-α ( 1∶1000 ) [34] ( a gift from Dr . Guy P . Richardson ) . Alexa fluor 488 and 546 goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used for secondary detection ( 1∶1000 ) ( Molecular Probes ) and Alexa fluor 546 phalloidin ( 1∶300 ) was used to stain actin . Auditory and vestibular tissues with their underlying mesenchyme were harvested from P0-P1 mouse inner ears and collected in 2 cm plastic dishes . The auditory epithelium consisted of the organ of Corti as dissected for a standard explant culture [35] . The vestibular epithelia consisted of the saccule , utricle and three cristae ampullaris , with a varying amount of semicircular canal epithelium . The tissue was then incubated with 0 . 5 mg/ml thermolysin ( Sigma ) in 25 mM Hepes medium for 20 minutes in a 37°C/5%CO2 humidified tissue culture incubator , for partial digestion of the extracellular matrix . The thermolysin was then aspirated and the epithelia were incubated with Accutase enzyme cell detachment medium ( eBioscience ) for 3 min in a standard tissue culture incubator followed by mechanical disruption of the tissue using a 23G blunt ended needle connected to a 1ml syringe , and then by another cycle of a 3-min incubation and mechanical disruption . Cellular dissociation was confirmed by direct visualization using an inverted tissue culture microscope . The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of complete medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 1% Hepes and 1% Glutamax in DMEM ( no antibiotics ) . Cells were passed through a 40-µm cell strainer ( BD ) and washed in PBS . Cells were counted and viability was assessed using Trypan blue exclusion ( Sigma ) . Usually less than 2% of the cells stained positive for Trypan blue . The dissociated cells were then stained with CD326-APC ( 1∶2 , 000 ) , CD49f-alexa488 ( 1∶100 ) and CD34-PE ( 1∶200 ) ( Biolegend ) diluted in FACS buffer ( PBS , 5% fetal calf serum ) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark followed by a wash in FACS buffer . The cells were then sorted using a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDB flow cytometer and cell sorter or BD FACSARIA Cell Sorter ( BD Biosciences ) . A small amount of cells from each population was routinely re-analyzed by performing a second pass through the sorter to evaluate the purity of the sorted cells . For the analysis of epithelial and non-epithelial gene expression in the Twirler mutant mice and their littermate controls , inner ears from newborn mice were dissected and dissociated as described . The cells were then stained with the antibody for CD326 in order to sort the cells into the epithelial and non-epithelial compartments . For cell sorting of auditory and vestibular epithelia of newborn Tw/Tw , Tw/+ and +/+ mice ( six , two and six ears , respectively ) were dissected as described above . Due to the structural changes in the cochlear epithelia of the homozygous mutant mice , the cochlear dissection for this set of experiments included the entire cochlear duct ( including the scala vestibuli and scala tympani ) to guarantee consistency in the dissections . Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit ( Qiagen ) . Real time RT-PCR for CD326 , CD49f and CD34 was performed as previously described [4] . Experiments were performed as two biologically independent replicates , with each biological experiment consisting of total RNA that was extracted from cells collected from at least 20 ears . Results were normalized to the expression of each gene in the cochlear neuronal cells . Whole-genome mouse mRNA expression profiles were recorded using the Illumina Bead Array system and MouseRef-6 v2 . 0 Expression BeadChips . These arrays contain more than 45K probes which collectively interrogate all RefSeq annotated mouse genes ( >26K genes ) and ∼ 7K RefSeq predicted genes . Ten to 20 ng of total RNA were used as starting material . Total RNA was pre-amplified with the Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 ( NuGEN ) . The A total of 1 . 5 µg of cDNA was then processed and labeled following the manufacturer's protocol . 1 . 5 µg of labeled cDNA were used for hybridization . Total RNA and cDNA were quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) and labeled cDNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ( Thermo Scientific ) prior to hybridization . Samples from the sorted populations of wild type mice were obtained and processed from three biologically independent experiments . The whole genome expression profiling of the Twirler mice was performed as a single repeat . Expression profiles were recorded from eight cellular populations ( four cell-types: sensory epithelial , neuronal , vascular endothelial and mesenchymal , isolated from two inner ear organs: the cochlea and the vestibular system ) in triplicates using Illumina Mouse WG6v2 BeadChip arrays . Expression levels were calculated using Illumina's Bead-Studio package . Probes not readily detected in the dataset were filtered out using detection p-values assigned by Bead-Studio to each measurement and requiring that each probe be detected ( p-value<0 . 01 ) in at least two samples . This criterion left 16 , 983 probes for subsequent analyses . Arrays were then normalized using quantile normalization . Expression data were then analyzed using the EXPANDER package [36] . Hierarchical clustering of the samples contained all the 16 , 983 expressed probes in the dataset and used the average-linkage method . Differentially expressed genes in the dataset were identified using two-way ANOVA analysis with a stringent p-value cutoff of 10-5 . 3 , 167 probes were significantly affected by either factor ( cell-type or organ ) or showed significant interaction between these two factors ( i . e . different cell-type expression patterns between the two organs ) . Main expression patterns exhibited by the set of differentially expressed genes were detected by cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm . Prior to clustering , the expression level of each probe was standardized to mean = 0 and SD = 1 . Enriched Gene Ontology ( GO ) categories in the clusters were sought using the TANGO algorithm implemented in EXPANDER . As clustering inherently generates a noisy division of probes and genes according to their expression patterns , we also defined more homogenous sets of cell-type specific markers . The set of marker genes of each cell-type included all the genes whose minimal expression level in the samples of that cell-type was at least 50% higher than its expression across all the rest of the samples . The expression patterns obtained by this division of genes were similar to those obtained by the clustering analysis ( Figure S4 and Table S5 ) . Identification of sets of genes which both 1 ) share similar expression patterns across the cell types in our dataset and 2 ) are physically connected in the cellular protein-protein interaction web , was carried out using the MATISSE algorithm [10] which is implemented in the EXPANDER package . Over-represented cis-regulatory sequence motifs in promoter regions ( −1000 to +200 nt relative to transcription start site ( TSS ) ) of the sets of cell-type marker genes were searched using AMADEUS [18] . The entire set of promoters of genes expressed in the dataset served as the background set in this analysis . miRNA activity was statistically sought by comparing , for each miRNA family and in each cell-type , the relative expression levels between the set of predicted targets of the miRNA and the background set containing all the rest of genes [14] . Significant down-regulation of predicted targets of a particular miRNA in a particular cell population suggests that the activity of the miRNA itself is enhanced in those cells . Predicted miRNA targets were obtained from TargetScanS [37] . Prior to carrying out these tests , the expression level of each gene was normalized to its average level across the eight conditions in our dataset to obtain relative levels . A list of cloned human deafness-related genes and deafness loci for which the underlying gene was not cloned yet was compiled from the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage ( http://hereditaryhearingloss . org/ ) . Human genes located within deafness loci were extracted using a Perl script . Mouse homologues of these genes were found using NCBI's HomoloGene [38] . Expression data were downloaded from Array-Express DB , quantile normalized and averaged over replicates . Expression ratios were then calculated between mean levels in the miR-96 mutant and wild-type samples . Whole-mount in-situ hybridization was performed with probes mmu-miR-182 and mmu-miR-200b ( Exiqon ) to detect miRNA-182 and 200b , respectively , as previously described [39] . No-probe experiments were performed as negative controls .",
         "The mammalian inner ear is a highly complex sensory organ , and mutations in more than 100 genes underlie hereditary human non-syndromic hearing loss . Nevertheless , little is known about the signaling cascades downstream of deafness genes . Genome-wide expression profiling is an invaluable tool for gaining systems-level understanding of biological processes . We developed and validated a simple and novel protocol to isolate sensory epithelial cells , neurons , blood vessels , and mesenchyme of auditory and vestibular epithelia from newborn wild-type mice . Our protocol is based on flow cytometry to sort and capture cells labeled with commercially available antibodies to endogenously expressed cluster of differentiation ( CD ) antigens . Using this strategy , we identified Zeb1 and miR200b as regulators of epithelial and mesenchymal identity in the mouse inner ear , and we further identified the signaling pathway disrupted by the Zeb1 mutation in the Twirler mouse mutant . We also show the utility of this approach for characterizing compartment-specific genes and protein–protein networks . Implementation of this isolation strategy to study other mouse mutants with hearing and balance phenotypes could overcome many of the obstacles to understanding the function of deafness genes .",

         "MBT domain proteins are involved in developmental processes and tumorigenesis . In vitro binding and mutagenesis studies have shown that individual MBT domains within clustered MBT repeat regions bind mono- and dimethylated histone lysine residues with little to no sequence specificity but discriminate against the tri- and unmethylated states . However , the exact function of promiscuous histone methyl-lysine binding in the biology of MBT domain proteins has not been elucidated . Here , we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans four MBT domain protein LIN-61 , in contrast to other MBT repeat factors , specifically interacts with histone H3 when methylated on lysine 9 , displaying a strong preference for di- and trimethylated states ( H3K9me2/3 ) . Although the fourth MBT repeat is implicated in this interaction , H3K9me2/3 binding minimally requires MBT repeats two to four . Further , mutagenesis of residues conserved with other methyl-lysine binding MBT regions in the fourth MBT repeat does not abolish interaction , implicating a distinct binding mode . In vivo , H3K9me2/3 interaction of LIN-61 is required for C . elegans vulva development within the synMuvB pathway . Mutant LIN-61 proteins deficient in H3K9me2/3 binding fail to rescue lin-61 synMuvB function . Also , previously identified point mutant synMuvB alleles are deficient in H3K9me2/3 interaction although these target residues that are outside of the fourth MBT repeat . Interestingly , lin-61 genetically interacts with two other synMuvB genes , hpl-2 , an HP1 homologous H3K9me2/3 binding factor , and met-2 , a SETDB1 homologous H3K9 methyl transferase ( H3K9MT ) , in determining C . elegans vulva development and fertility . Besides identifying the first sequence specific and di-/trimethylation binding MBT domain protein , our studies imply complex multi-domain regulation of ligand interaction of MBT domains . Our results also introduce a mechanistic link between LIN-61 function and biology , and they establish interplay of the H3K9me2/3 binding proteins , LIN-61 and HPL-2 , as well as the H3K9MT MET-2 in distinct developmental pathways .\nProteins containing MBT ( malignant brain tumor ) domains potentially act as tumor suppressors and might modulate gene repression in the context of chromatin . The MBT repeat is a highly conserved structural motif of ca . 100 amino acids that is found from C . elegans to humans and that exists as tandem repeats of two to four elements [1] . Three linearly arranged MBT domains were first identified in the gene corresponding to the Drosophila lethal ( 3 ) malignant brain tumor ( l ( 3 ) mbt ) mutant , an embryonic lethal mutation associated with malignant transformations of optic neuroblasts [2] , [3] . In flies , only two other MBT domain-containing proteins exist , Sex comb on midleg ( Scm , containing two MBT domains ) and Sex comb with four MBT domains ( Sfmbt ) . Both are members of Polycomb group related complexes implicated in repression of Hox genes [4] , [5] . Like L ( 3 ) mbt , Sfmbt and Scm are essential for Drosophila embryonic development [5]–[7] . In mammals , there are at least nine MBT repeat proteins , each containing two ( SCMH1 , SCML2 ) , three ( L3MBTL1 , L3MBTL3 , L3MBTL4 ) or four ( L3MBTL2 , MBTD1 , SFMBT1 , SFMBT2 ) MBT repeats , respectively . Disruption of scmh1 , l3mbtl1 or l3mbtl in mouse germline has only minor effects , indicating possible redundant and overlapping effects [8]–[10] . Nevertheless , L3MBTL3 , L3MBTL2 and SCML2 are mutated in rare cases of medulloblastoma , indicating that MBT domain proteins may be tumor suppressors [11] . In agreement , mammalian MBT domain proteins function as transcriptional repressors in different contexts , for example when directly targeted to transcriptional reporter systems via heterologous DNA binding domains or on the cyclin E promoter [12] , [13] . For this function , the MBT domains appear essential [14] . MBT domain proteins in flies and human contain additional domains besides MBT repeats , such as Zn fingers and SPM regions . In contrast , the two C . elegans MBT domain proteins , LIN-61 and MBTR-1 are composed almost completely of four MBT repeats ( for review see [1] ) . While the function of mbtr-1 is unknown , lin-61 was recently implicated in the synMuvB pathway of C . elegans vulva development [15] , [16] . Here , simultaneous mutation of individual genes within two groups , synMuvA and synMuvB , causes formation of additional vulva like protrusions on the ventral side of the worm ( multivulva , Muv phenotype ) ( for review see [17] ) . While a large number of chromatin factors are classified as synMuvB , the exact molecular roles of these factors within C . elegans developmental pathways have not been defined . Diverse post-translational modifications ( PTM ) of histone proteins play important roles in regulating chromatin states and thereby the use and readout of the genome . Especially , methylation of distinct histone lysine residues provides a large array of regulatory options , as these confer site ( position of the modified lysine in the primary sequence ) and modification stage ( mono- vs . di- . vs . trimethylation ) specific effects [18] . This has been shown , for example , for activating methyl-lysine marks H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me ) and H3 lysine 36 ( H3K36me ) , where different methylation states are associated with distinct roles in the transcription cycle ( for review see [19] ) . Methylation of H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9me ) , in contrast , has been largely studied in the context of gene silencing , especially within heterochromatin . While the di- and trimethylated states of this mark ( H3K9me2/3 ) mainly localize to repressed regions of the genome , these have also been found associated with the body of transcribed genes [20] , [21] . H3K9me1 , in contrast , shows a more euchromatic distribution [22] , [23] . Differential and site-specific histone lysine methylation is established by distinct histone methyl-transferases ( HKMT ) . Di- and trimethylation of H3K9 are mediated by the Suv39h1/h2 isoenzymes , CLLD8/KMT1F as well as the ESET/SETDB1 histone methyltransferase [24]–[26] . SETDB1 is mainly found in euchromatic regions , where it participates in gene silencing [27] . In contrast , CLLD8/KMT1F and Suv39-like enzymes localize to pericentromeric heterochromatin [26] . While all putative HMTs of C . elegans were analyzed for function within the synMuv pathways , only the met-1 and met-2 genes genetically interact with synMuvA factors [28] . While MET-1 appears to methylate H3K36 , met-2 encodes a SETDB1 homologous H3K9MT . Besides function in vulva cell fate determination , recent work has shown that MET-2 is required for all germline H3K9me2 [29] . A number of proteins have been identified that specifically interact with histone methyl-lysine residues . These include chromodomain- , PHD finger- , tudor domain- and ankyrin domain-containing chromatin factors . In vitro , proteins containing these domains show significant site specificity in binding to distinct histone methyl-lysine marks . Also , clear preference for either higher ( me2/me3 ) or lower ( me1/me2 ) methylation states are observed . For example , heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) binds H3K9me3- and H3K9me2-containing peptides preferentially over H3K9me0 and H3K9me1 targets . Also , discrimination against other sites of lysine methylation , even when in similar sequence context such as H3K27me ( both H3K9 and H3K27 reside within an “ARKS” sequence patch ) , is observed [30] . Interestingly , one of the two HP1 orthologs in C . elegans , HPL-2 is classified as a synMuvB factor [31] . The other ortholog , HPL-1 seems to act as an enhancer of HPL-2 in this and other developmental pathways [32] . Colocalization of binding factors with cognate histone PTMs on a global scale by immunofluorescence studies or on a local scale by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments have suggested that PTM recognition might be a common targeting mechanisms of chromatin factors [33] . Also , recognition of multiple histone PTMs in the context of higher order complexes of binding factors might directly affect chromatin structure , inducing higher order chromatin folds [13] , [34] . However , the exact working mechanisms of many histone modification binding proteins , their recruitment , and their downstream actions have not been fully elucidated . MBT domains constitute a separate class of histone methyl-lysine reading modules that seem not to have high selectivity for their target sites . In vitro , diverse MBT domain regions from different proteins and organisms display specificity for mono- and dimethylated lysine residues over the unmodified and trimethylated states . However , site discrimination and specificity for selected sites is very low [1] , [5] , [12] , [35]–[39] . These findings are complemented by structural studies that have implemented three aromatic caging residues and an aspartate moiety in methyl-lysine binding . In this “cavity insertion mode , ” there is little contribution of protein surface residues in histone sequence recognition [35]–[41] . Interestingly , only individual MBT domains within multiple MBT repeat-containing elements are implicated in histone methyl-lysine binding [12] , [35] , [36] . In this sense , the biological role and functional implications of the other MBT repeats within the linearly arranged MBT regions are unclear . MBT domain proteins might exert higher specificity for particular histone methyl-lysine PTMs in vivo as suggested by indirect targeting experiments [12] . While it is clear that MBT domain proteins contribute to the complex organization of chromatin as readers and effectors of histone PTMs that is critical for the establishment of specific cellular differentiation states [33] , [34] , [42] , the exact contribution of methyl-lysine binding activity to the biology of these proteins has not been worked out . Here , we show that C . elegans LIN-61 specifically interacts with H3K9me2/3 . Sequence homology and mutagenesis studies imply the fourth MBT repeat in this interaction . However , a minimum of three C-terminal MBT repeats is required for H3K9me2/3 binding and analysis of previously identified lin-61 point mutant alleles indicates complex conformational regulation of ligand interaction of LIN-61 MBT domains . We find that in vivo H3K9me2/3 binding of LIN-61 is necessary for C . elegans vulva development within the synMuvB pathway . We also demonstrate that lin-61 genetically interacts with hpl-2 , an HP1 ortholog H3K9me2/3 binding factor and met-2 , an H3K9 methyl transferase in determining C . elegans vulva development and fertility .\nWe used peptide affinity purification experiments to identify binding partners of H3K9me3 in C . elegans extracts . Besides other factors , LIN-61 and MBTR-1 were identified in MS analysis of proteins bound to H3K9me3 peptides compared to the H3K9me0 control ( Figure S1A-S1C ) . Both proteins share the same four MBT domain overall structure and are 40% identical in sequence ( Figure S1D ) . We raised antibodies specific for LIN-61 ( Figure S2D ) and confirmed this finding using a panel of lysine methylated histone peptides in affinity purification experiments . As Figure 1A shows , LIN-61 from C . elegans extracts interacted preferentially with the H3K9me3 peptide compared to the H3K9me1 peptide . No interaction with the H3K9me0 peptide was found under these conditions . Binding to H3K9me was specific as no binding to H3K4me3- , H3K27me3- , H3K36me3- or H4K20me3-containing peptides was observed . In contrast and as was previously found [12] , the recombinant MBT domains of human L3MBTL1 bound to the monomethylated forms of all tested histone methyl-lysine sites with little to no sequence preference in the same assay ( Figure 1A ) . Additional experiments showed that LIN-61 binds to H3K9me2 equally well as to H3K9me3 ( Figure 1B ) . HP1 proteins in different model systems have been described as major H3K9me3 interacting chromatin factors . On the basis of immunofluorescence experiments , it was nevertheless suggested that HPL-2 , one of the two C . elegans HP1 orthologous factors might not be a direct binding protein of H3K9me3 [43] . We detected HPL-2 in affinity purification experiments of C . elegans extracts using H3K9me peptides . We found slight preference for the trimethlated over the monomethylated form and discrimination against the unmodified template ( Figure 1A ) . To exclude indirect binding of LIN-61 to H3K9me2/3 via bridging interaction by the C . elegans HPL-1 and HPL-2 HP1 proteins , we repeated the affinity purification experiments using extracts prepared from hpl-1 and hpl-2 mutant worms . LIN-61 was recovered on H3K9me3 peptide-containing beads under these conditions comparable to the wild type situation ( Figure 1C ) . Further , we purified recombinant MBP-LIN-61 fusion protein after expression in bacteria . In affinity purification experiments , the recombinant LIN-61 protein showed strong preference for the H3K9me3 peptide over H3K4 , H3K27 , H3K36 , H3K64 and H4K20 trimethylated peptides and for the trimethylated H3K9 site over the monomethylated form reminiscent of the endogenous C . elegans protein ( Figure 1D and Figure S1E ) . Also , in vitro translated LIN-61 and MBTR-1 proteins specifically bound H3K9me3 ( Figure S1F and S1G ) . Only H3K9me3 peptide but not H3K9me0 , H4K20me0 or H4K20me3 peptides was able to compete with the binding of recombinant LIN-61 to the immobilized H3K9me3 target ( Figure 1E ) . From these experiments we conclude that the C . elegans MBT domain protein LIN-61 specifically and autonomously interacts with H3K9me . In contrast to other MBT proteins that display little to no sequence specific methyl-lysine binding and that discriminate against the tri-methylated state , LIN-61 shows preference for the di- and tri-methylated states of the H3K9 site . Alignment of LIN-61 with other MBT domain proteins , dScm [35] , hL3MBTL1 [37] , dSfmbt [5] , [36] , hL3MBTL2 [41] and hMBTD1 [40] indicated that only the fourth MBT repeat of LIN-61 contains all three aromatic caging residues and the aspartate moiety that have been implicated in methyl-lysine binding of other MBT repeats ( Figure 2A and 2B ) . From the structural insights available from these MBT domain proteins , we predicted that LIN-61 MBT domain four is involved in H3K9me3 peptide interaction . To characterize the H3K9me binding of LIN-61 , we first analyzed a series of mutant recombinant GST-fusion proteins where different MBT repeats were deleted ( Figure 2C ) . In peptide affinity purification experiments we found the first MBT repeat of LIN-61 dispensable for H3K9me interaction . When additional MBT repeats were deleted , neither truncated LIN-61 protein corresponding to MBT repeats three and four nor truncated LIN-61 protein corresponding to MBT repeats two and three bound the H3K9me3 peptide . Also , none of the individual MBT repeats showed any interaction . Next , we analyzed a series of LIN-61 proteins with point mutations in conserved residues in MBT domain four . In other factors , these residues were implicated in MBT repeat methyl-lysine binding . To this end , affinity purifications were carried out with in vitro translated MYC-tagged LIN-61 proteins ( Figure 2D ) . Mutation of the highly conserved aspartate residue ( LIN-61 D428A ) caused reduced binding , but did not abolish interaction . This finding is in stark contrast to other MBT domain protein interaction with mono- and dimethylated histone lysine residues where the corresponding residue is absolutely required [35]–[37] . In agreement with an aromatic cage in MBT domain four being involved in H3K9me3 binding , simultaneous mutation of three conserved aromatic residues in LIN-61 MBT domain four ( LIN-61 F452A/W455A/F459A ) completely abolished H3K9me3 interaction . However , we found only two of these residues , W455 and F459 , essential for methyl-lysine binding , whereas F452 was not necessary for interaction . We conclude that MBT domain four of LIN-61 is likely directly involved in H3K9me3 binding . The results suggest that the overall structure of the three MBT repeats two to four is essential for this interaction . In general , LIN-61 binding to methyl-lysine residues appears to be different from other MBT repeat-containing methyl-lysine binding factors . To analyze the biological role of LIN-61 H3K9me2/3 binding , we obtained a deletion mutant worm strain from the National BioResource Project . Analysis of this strain , lin-61 ( tm2649 ) indicated loss of a 672 bp fragment spanning from the middle of exon two to exon four ( Figure S2A ) . While shortened mRNA could be detected by reverse transcription PCR analysis ( Figure S2B ) , Western blotting using two different antibodies directed against an N- terminal region of LIN-61 or the full-length recombinant protein verified that lin-61 ( tm2649 ) is a protein null mutant allele ( Figure S2D and S2E ) . In agreement with previous observations on lin-61 mutant C . elegans , lin-61 ( tm2649 ) did not have any apparent phenotype on the level of the organism [15] . We also did not detect profound changes on a cellular level , and the global degree of H3K9me2/3 was unchanged ( data not shown ) . Nevertheless , congruent with the earlier studies , we detected a synMuv phenotype for lin-61 ( Figure 3A and 3B ) . Only when individual members of two sets of genes , synMuvA and synMuvB , in the C . elegans vulva development pathway are simultaneously mutated is a multivulva ( Muv ) phenotype observed . Individual synMuvA or SynMuvB gene mutation does not cause a phenotype . lin-61 ( tm2649 ) in the background of lin-15A ( n767 ) , a synMuvA gene , caused extra ventral protrusions ( pseudovulvae ) in 78 . 3% of worms at 20°C and in 99 . 9% of worms at 24 . 5°C . Similarly , RNAi knockdown of the lin-15A gene product in lin-61 ( tm2649 ) C . elegans caused a Muv phenotype with a frequency of 94 . 0% at 24 . 5°C ( Table 1 ) . These finding confirm lin-61 as a synMuvB gene . To analyze whether H3K9me3 binding is essential for LIN-61 function within the synMuv pathway , we injected a genomic lin-61 DNA fragment into lin-61 ( tm2649 ) ; lin-15A ( n767 ) C . elegans ( Figure 3C ) . In seven independent C . elegans lines , we observed significant rescue of the Muv phenotype where the individual lines displayed a residual frequency of worms containing pseudovulvaes from 12 . 1% to 35 . 8% . In contrast , injection of the same genomic DNA fragment carrying the F452A/W455A/F459A triple mutation that abolished LIN-61–H3K9me3 interaction did not rescue the Muv phenotype at all . In four independent C . elegans lines , we observed Muv phenotypes with a frequency close to 100% . Importantly , Western blot analysis of transgene expression in several of the C . elegans lines verified that the exogenous lin-61 wild type and mutant gene copies were expressed to levels comparable to those in wild type worms ( Figure 3D ) . A number of lin-61 point mutant alleles with synMuv phenotypes have been described [15] . While some of these mutants show significantly reduced expression levels ( n3807 , n3922 ) others have diminished ( n3624 , n3736 ) or wild type LIN-61 content ( n3447 ) [15] . We expressed the corresponding mutant proteins in an in vitro translation system and tested their interaction with H3K9me3 peptides in affinity purification experiments ( for a map of the mutants see Figure 2B ) . As Figure 3E shows , the G445R ( within MBT domain four ) and G250F ( within MBT domain two ) mutant proteins encoded by the lin-61 ( n3922 ) and lin-61 ( n3807 ) alleles did not bind to H3K9me3 . The P132S mutant protein ( within MBT domain one ) encoded by the lin-61 ( n3624 ) allele , in contrast , showed H3K9me3 interaction similar to the wild type factor . The F247S mutant protein ( within MBT domain two ) encoded by the lin-61 ( n3736 ) allele showed somewhat reduced binding . However , the S354N mutant protein ( within MBT domain three ) encoded by the lin-61 ( n3447 ) allele showed significantly reduced H3K9me3 interaction . Considering the expression levels of the mutant proteins , we conclude from these experiments that H3K9me2/3 binding is essential for LIN-61 function in the synMuv pathway and that amino acid residues outside of MBT repeat four are essential for interaction of LIN-61 with H3K9me2/3 . Also , additional protein interactions that map outside the MBT domains two to four , which are required for H3K9me2/3 binding , are likely involved in LIN-61 synMuv function . Only one of the two HP1 orthologous factors in C . elegans , hpl-2 but not hpl-1 is a synMuvB gene [31] . Since we detected both LIN-61 and HPL-2 interacting with H3K9me2/3 , we asked whether these two factors act synergistically in C . elegans vulva cell fate determination . It has been suggested that such genetic enhancement studies can be used to dissect the relationship of genes within biological pathways [44] . In agreement with earlier findings , hpl-2 mutant worms did not show a phenotype at 20°C , but displayed low frequency of Muv phenotype at elevated temperature ( 24 . 5°C ) ( Table 1 ) [32] , [43] . Interestingly , lin-61;hpl-2 double mutant worms showed a very high frequency of Muv phenotype under these conditions in the absence of a synMuvA mutation , indicating strong genetic interaction between these factors within this process ( Figure 4A and Table 1 ) . Importantly , mbtr-1 , which itself is not a synMuvB gene [15] , but whose protein product binds H3K9me2/3 , did not act synergistically either with hpl-2 or lin-61 in these experiments ( see also Figure S2F ) . Also , hpl-1 , which enhances the mild Muv phenotype of hpl-2 observed at elevated temperature [32] , did not synergize with lin-61 . We infer that LIN-61 and HPL-2 might regulate the same target genes in the synMuv pathway , possibly via binding the same H3K9me2/3 regions of the genome . MET-2 is the H3K9MT within the synMuvB pathway . If a linear pathway from MET-2 , which establishes H3K9me2/3 modification on target regions of the genome involved in determining C . elegans vulva cell fate , to LIN-61 , which binds and translates this chromatin mark , exists , then the corresponding genes should show no interaction . Similar to earlier studies [28] , we did not detect worms with pseudovulvaes with considerable frequency for met-2 even at elevated temperature . In context of lin-61;met-2 we found no significant Muv phenotype at 20°C . However , at 24 . 5°C we found 12 . 9% of double mutant worms containing peseudovulvaes indicating a weak but robust genetic interaction of lin-61 and met-2 . The results indicate that met-2 is not only upstream of lin-61 , but also acts to some degree parallel to this gene in determining C . elegans vulva cell fate . LIN-61 is globally distributed and shows chromatin association in adult worms and focal distribution in embryos [15] . Therefore , the synMuv pathway represents only part of LIN-61 biology . In addition , several synMuvB genes have been found to interact with hpl-2 [28] , [31] , [43] . hpl-1 also enhances the frequency of C . elegans with pseudovulvaes . As hpl-2 might therefore be a special synMuvB gene displaying pleiotropic effects [28] , we wanted to test whether lin-61 and hpl-2 interact beyond the synMuv pathway . As both , HPL-2 and MET-2 have been implied in germ line development [29] , [31] , [32] , we investigated whether LIN-61 also synergizes with these factors in determining C . elegans fertility and brood size . In agreement with earlier findings , hpl-2 mutation caused some sterility of worms ( 13% ) that was enhanced at higher temperature ( 25% at 24 . 5°C , Table 2 ) [31] , [32] . For lin-61 C . elegans , we detected only very low sterility at elevated temperature ( 2% at 24 . 5°C compared to 0% at 20°C ) . However , lin61;hpl-2 double mutant worms showed 22% sterility at 20°C and 98% sterility at 24 . 5°C , indicating strong interaction . These effects were not caused by general loss of germ cells but were due to enhancement of the defects observed for hpl-2 worms [31] . While 1% of hpl-2 worms had no oocytes and 2% displayed failures in gonad elongation , 32% showed defects in oocyte maturation or fertilization ( n = 88 ) . In contrast , 35% of lin61;hpl-2 double mutant worms had no oocytes , 25% displayed failures in gonad elongation and 22% showed defects in oocyte maturation or fertilization at 24 . 5°C ( n = 113 , Figure 4B ) . Importantly , no synergism between mbtr-1 and lin-61 or hpl-2 in causing C . elegans sterility was observed . Similar to the results of the Muv analysis , we also detected some – albeit weaker – synergism between lin-61 and met-2 , which itself brought about only a mild phenotype under the conditions tested , in causing sterility of C . elegans , ( Table 2 ) [29] . Observations analogous to those made when evaluating C . elegans sterility were made when analyzing the brood size of mutant worms ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . lin-61 caused mild but significant reduction in brood size at 20°C and brought about more severe reduction at 24 . 5°C . At both conditions tested , a clear synergism with the brood size reduction of hpl-2 was observed . Similarly , interaction of lin-61 with met-2 was detected in this assay . We conclude that within different pathways of differentiation of somatic cells such as determining C . elegans vulva cell fate and of development of germ cells such as determining C . elegans fertility , the H3K9me2/3 binding proteins LIN-61 and HPL-2 have overlapping functionality by at least partially working in parallel pathways . Similarly , lin-61 and met-2 show some redundancy .\nOur results have two main implications . On one side , they are important for the understanding of MBT protein histone methyl-lysine binding and on the other side they provide molecular insights into the synMuv pathway in C . elegans . Why is LIN-61 ( and MBTR-1 ) binding to H3K9me2/3 highly specific whereas MBT containing proteins of Drosophila and human origin show promiscuous interaction with methyl-lysine residues embedded in different sequence context ? The specific ligands for other MBT domain proteins might not yet have been identified and the analyzed histone methyl-lysine target sites might only be surrogate interaction partners . Yet , in the available structures of MBT domain–ligand complexes , there is very little specific interaction of MBT surfaces with histone sequences . Binding appears largely dependent on unspecific contact of charged interfaces [35]–[41] . Alternatively , interaction might be more specific in cellular context . To this point , binding studies investigating MBT domain behavior have been undertaken with recombinant proteins . In vivo , the MBT proteins of higher eukaryotes might need to be modified or interacting with other factors to allow for sequence specific histone methyl-lysine binding . Along this line , H4K20me1 , but not H3K9me1/2 , recruits hL3MBTL1 in cellular target assays to chromatin , despite the fact that peptides containing these histone marks bind to the recombinant MBT repeats with similar affinities in vitro [12] . Lastly , the methyl-lysine binding mode of LIN-61 might be completely different from other MBT proteins . Mutagenesis of two of three conserved putatively methyl-group caging aromatic residues abolishes LIN-61–H3K9me3 interaction . However , mutagenesis of the third aromatic residue , F452 does not have an effect . Further , mutation of D428 , a highly conserved , charged residue implicated in essential salt bridging and hydrogen bonding of the mono- and dimethylammonium moieties of the methylated lysines in other MBT domain–ligand complexes did not abolish interaction [35]–[37] . A different binding mode is clearly inferred from the fact that LIN-61 prefers the di-and trimethylated states of its target H3K9me residue to the unmodified and mono-methylated forms , whereas other MBT-proteins discriminate against the fully methylated states . Structural studies of Drosophila and human factors have revealed interdigitation of the N-terminal arms of predicted MBT repeats with β-barrel folds of adjacent MBT domains [35]–[41] , [45] . While the exact functional consequence of this overall folding principle of MBT proteins is unclear , expression of the individual MBT repeats of hSCML2 was not possible [46] . We could investigate the individual MBT repeats of LIN-61 , but found them incapable of mediating H3K9me2/3 interaction . We also note that proteins containing only two MBT repeats of the SCM type display about 50- to 100-fold weaker binding to methyl-lysine residues compared to three or four MBT repeat containing factors [5] , [12] , [35]–[39] . Interestingly , four MBT domains of dSfmbt , hL3MBTL2 and hMBTD1 fold into three propeller blade like structures similar to three MBT domain proteins ( hL3MBTL1 [37] , [38] , [45] with the fourth MBT domain stacked atop the planar arrangement [36] , [40] , [41] . Our results on LIN-61 indeed indicate that the first MBT repeat is dispensable for H3K9me2/3 binding . What is it about three MBT domain structures that mediate stable interactions with methyl-lysine ligands ? In the ring form with each domain making contact to two adjacent domains , the individual MBT repeats and especially the single ligand binding domains might be structurally stabilized . Indeed , almost all mutations that cause the malignant phenotype in Drosophila l ( 3 ) mbt or the polycomb phenotype of Scm map to the MBT repeats but not necessarily to the domain that has been implicated in methyl-lysine interaction [4] , [47] . While the corresponding mutant proteins have not yet been explicitly tested in in vitro binding experiments , we show that several single amino acid exchanges in LIN-61 that map outside of MBT repeat four interfere with H3K9me2/3 interaction . Some of these mutations , G445R ( n3922 ) and G250F ( n3807 ) obviously affect overall protein stability as they are detected only at very low levels in mutant C . elegans [15] . However , other mutant LIN-61 proteins , which are expressed to significant ( F247S ( n3736 ) ) or even wild type ( S354N ( n3447 ) ) levels , nevertheless interfere with H3K9me2/3 interaction . While these findings might indicate a composite LIN-61 binding surface with elements of different MBT repeats , they could also point to conformational linkage within the three MBT repeat structures [1] . Slight differences of MBT domain architecture and especially the methyl-lysine binding pockets crystallized under different conditions or in the absence and presence of ligand have been observed [39] , [45] . It remains open whether additional ligands regulate the cross-talk of MBT domains or whether other mechanisms of MBT domain interaction and regulation exist . Structural insights of LIN-61–H3K9me2/3 binding and of mutant LIN-61 proteins are required to better understand not only LIN-61 but also general MBT domain function . Besides the possible implications for the biochemistry of MBT domain-containing proteins , our studies on LIN-61 also involve and further emphasize a significant role for H3K9me in the synMuv pathway of C . elegans vulva cell fate determination . They also stress a role of H3K9me2/3 in germline development . We confirm here that the HP1 homolog synMuvB factor HPL-2 recognizes H3K9 methylation and introduce LIN-61 as novel H3K9me2/3 reader . The high degree of synergy between lin-61 and hpl-2 in vulva cell fate determination and germline development might indicate that these are the only reader proteins in these pathways acting in parallel to translate the effects of H3K9me2/3 . While both factors might act redundantly , binding H3K9me2/3 independently and targeting similar downstream machinery to the same regions of the genome , we also consider a direct interplay between these factors . LIN-61 and HPL-2 might be part of the same multiprotein complex ( es ) . These associations might be transient in the nucleoplasm , as no stable interaction of LIN-61 and HPL-2 was observed in immunoprecipitation experiments [15] . However , these might be stabilized by additional components on the target chromatin regions . While in many instances the H3K9me2/3 binding activity of either HPL-2 or LIN-61 might be sufficient , under conditions of stress ( such as elevated temperature ) both proteins might be necessary to stably anchor effector machinery at certain sites of the genome . It has been proposed that such multivalency binding modes could be crucial to the stable readout of patterns of histone modifications [34] . Earlier work has implied enzymatic activity of MET-2 in the synMuv pathway [28] . It has also been found that this protein in the germline of C . elegans exclusively establishes H3K9me2 [29] . We detect mild but significant genetic interaction of met-2 with lin-61 in determining C . elegans vulva cell fate and in germline development . Such interaction would not be expected in a strictly singular linear writer ( H3K9MT ) – reader ( H3K9me2/3 binding protein ) relationship . Obviously , met-2 is not essential in both pathways of worm development . Other HKMTs can substitute at least partially for MET-2 function . One candidate is met-1 , which has been shown to affect global H3K9me3 to some degree and which is also a synMuvB factor [28] . Another candidate is MES-2 , which in the germline mediates H3K9me3 but does not affect H3K9me2 [29] . Genetic interaction of met-2 and lin-61 might then be due to possible self-reinforcing loops , where H3K9MTs redundant to MET-2 have to be brought to and maintained at target regions via anchoring activity of LIN-61 as an H3K9me binding protein . HPL-2 might only partially be able to substitute for this function , for example if it does not directly interact with the H3K9MTs . Indeed , direct interactions between HKMTs and proteins binding the corresponding histone modifications have been observed in several instances , for example in the case of Suv-39/HP1 [48] and PR-SET7/L3MBTL1 [12] . What are the targets of the MET-2/LIN-61/HPL-2/H3K9me2/3 system ? Penetrance of the Muv phenotype has directly been linked to aberrant , increased expression levels of lin-3 EGF in the hyp7 syncytium , which is secreted and induces abnormal differentiation of additional vulva precursor cells ( VPC ) ( see Figure 3A ) [44] , [49] . Indeed , all three components , lin-61 , hpl-2 and met-2 , have been shown to cause elevated LIN-3 levels in a lin-15A background [28] , [44] . However , the available genome wide mapping data of H3K9me3 do not show enrichment of H3K9me3 at the lin-3 locus [50] . Also , we have failed so far to detect H3K9me2/3 at this region using direct ChIP approaches . Therefore , the mechanisms by which MET-2/LIN-61/HPL-2/H3K9me2/3 regulate lin-3 might be indirect , involving intermediate factors . Since no synMuvA mutation is needed for inducing a Muv phenotype in lin-61;hpl-2 and lin-61;met-2 ( this study ) as well as met-2 hpl-2 [28] double mutant C . elegans , we infer nevertheless that H3K9me2/3 is central in vulva cell fate determination . The results also support a more operational definition of synMuv genes using genetic enhancement tests [44] compared to the original classification where synMuvB mutants are supposed to result in a Muv phenotype only in combination with mutations in the synMuvA pathway , and where factors of one class do not genetically interact [51] . Since LIN-61 is globally distributed in adult worms and embryos [15] , it is clear that this factor has other functionality outside of vulva cell fate determination and germline development . A role in genomic stability has been suggested using an RNAi screening strategy [52] . It remains to be seen whether this and putative other functions of LIN-61 also depend on H3K9me2/3 binding . Since mutation of P132 ( corresponding to the n3624 allele of lin-61 ) does not interfere with H3K9me2/3 interaction and as the n3447 allele is not a very strong synMuv mutant [15] , additional biochemical functions of LIN-61 clearly await discovery .\nCosmid R06C7 was obtained from the Sanger Institute ( UK ) . Plasmids R06C7 . 7 pL4440-Dest-containing cDNA corresponding to LIN-61 and ZK678 . 1 pL4440-Dest-containing cDNA corresponding to LIN-15A were obtained from OpenBiosystems . l3mbtl1pCMV-SPORT6 plasmid containing the cDNA of human L3MBTL1 ( GenBank BC039829 . 1 ) was obtained from Geneservice . MBTR-1 cDNA containing the full ORF was amplified from total C . elegans mRNA after reverse transcription . cDNAs were subcloned into the following vectors using standard PCR and cloning procedures: pETM-40 ( gift of G . Stier , EMBL Heidelberg ) for generating MBP-tagged LIN-61; pcDNA3 . 1 to generate MYC-tagged LIN-61 and MYC-tagged MBTR-1 . hL3MBTL1 cDNA corresponding to amino acid residues 197-526 were cloned into pET16b ( Merck ) to generate His6-3xMBT-L3MBTL1 . cDNAs corresponding to the following amino acid residues of LIN-61 were cloned into pGEX-4T-3: GST-MBT ( 2-4 ) -LIN61 , aa 138-491; GST-MBT ( 2-3 ) -LIN61 , aa 138-383; GST-MBT ( 3-4 ) -LIN61 , aa 266-491; GST-MBT ( 2 ) -LIN61 , aa 138-265 , GST-MBT ( 3 ) -LIN61 , aa 266-383; GST-MBT ( 4 ) -LIN61 , aa 384-491 . Side directed mutagenesis ( LIN61 D248A; F452A/W455A/F459A; F452A; W455A; F459A; P132S; F247S; G250F; S354N; G445R ) was carried out according to the QuickChange protocol ( Stratagene ) . A 4387 bp fragment of C . elegans genomic DNA generated by StuI/SacII restriction digest of cosmid R06C7 was cloned into pBluescript SK ( - ) ( Stratagene ) and used for microinjection experiments [15] .

Experiments were performed as described with slight modification [53] . 1 ml C . elegans extract ( 5 mg/ml ) , 17 µl TNT in vitro translation reaction or 25 µg recombinant protein with 30 µl avidin agarose resin ( Thermo Scientific ) were used per reaction . PD150 buffer was supplemented with 0 . 5% ( w/v ) low fat dry milk as blocking reagent . Peptides carried a biotinylated lysine residue at the C-terminus for affinity purifications: H3K4me1/3: ARTK ( me1/3 ) QTARKSTGGKAPRKQLK-biotin; H3K9me0: ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLK-biotin; H3K9me1/2/3: ARTKQTARK ( me1/2/3 ) STGGKAPRKQLK-biotin; H3K27me0: QLATKAARKSAPATGGVKKPHK-biotin; H3K27me1/3: QLATKAARK ( me1/3 ) SAPATGGVKKPHK-biotin; H3K36me3: SAPATGGVK ( me3 ) KPHRYRP-biotin; H3K64me0: STELLIRKLPFQRLVREI-biotin; H3K64me3: STELLIRK ( me3 ) LPFQRLVREI-biotin; H4K20me0: KGGAKRHRKVLRDNIQ-biotin; H4K20me1/3: KGGAKRHRK ( me1/3 ) VLRDNIQ-biotin . SDS PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and entire gel lanes were cut into 23 slices of equal size . Proteins within the slices were digested according to Shevchenko et al . [54] . Peptides were extracted and analyzed by LC-coupled tandem MS on an Orbitrap Xl mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . CID fragment spectra were searched against NCBInr database using MASCOT ( taxonomy filter C . elegans ) as search engine . For Western blot analysis , primary antibodies were used as follows: anti-LIN-61 ( rabbit ) , 1∶4000; anti-LIN-61 ( guinea pig ) , 1∶1000; anti-HPL2 ( gift from F . Palladino , ENS de Lyon ) , 1∶1000; anti-His6 ( Santa Cruz ) , 1∶1000; anti-H3 ( Abcam ) , 1∶10000; anti-Myc ( Millipore ) , 1∶1000 . MBP- , His6- and GST-fusion proteins were expressed in E . coli strain BL21-CodonPlus ( DE3 ) -RIL ( Stratagene ) using auto-inducing medium . Cells were harvested and frozen in lysis buffer: MBP lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM Benzamidine , pH 7 . 4 ) ; His6 lysis buffer ( 50 mM sodium phosphate , 300 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 2 mM PMSF , 2 mM benzamidine , 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , pH 8 . 0 ) ; GST lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 2 mM PMSF , 2 mM benzamidine , pH 7 . 4 ) . After thawing , bacterial suspensions were passed multiple times through an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer ( Avestin ) . After clarification of extracts ( 40 , 000×g , 15 min , 4°C ) , protein purification was carried out on amylose ( MBP-tagged proteins , NEB ) , Ni-NTA ( His6-tagged proteins , Qiagen ) or GSH resins ( GST-tagged proteins , GE Healthcare ) , according to the manufacturers' protocols . C . elegans was cultivated on NGM plates seeded with E . coli OP50-1 or in liquid S medium containing E . coli HB101 as described [55]–[57] . N2 was the wild type strain . C . elegans strains with the following genotypes were used: LGI: mbtr-1 ( n4775 ) [15] , lin-61 ( tm2649 ) ( National BioResource project ) ; LGIII: met-2 ( n4256 ) [28] , hpl-2 ( tm1489 ) [43]; LGX: hpl-1 ( tm1624 ) [32] , lin-15A ( n767 ) [58] . Single worm PCR was carried out to analyze genotypes ( details of PCR reaction conditions and primers are available upon request ) . Microinjection of C . elegans was performed as described with some modifications [59] . pRF4 plasmid expressing the rol-6 ( su1006 ) allele was used as injection marker at a ratio of 4∶1 compared to linearized ( SacII – PspOMI restriction digest of the pBluescript R06C7 plasmid ) genomic lin-61 DNA fragment . F1 progeny displaying a roller phenotype were singled . Plates were incubated for at least one week until offspring were starved . Individuals with a roller phenotype were transferred to new plates and progeny was analyzed . RNAi feeding experiments were performed as described [60] . C . elegans protein extract was prepared according to Cheeseman et al . with some modifications [61] . ∼ 5 g of frozen C . elegans were grounded using a pre-chilled mortar and pestle in liquid N2 . The grounded worm pellet was supplemented with an equal volume of 2x extraction buffer ( 50 mM HEPES-KOH , 2 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl2 , 200 mM KCl , 20% glycerol , 0 . 1% NP-40 , 2x EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche ) , pH 7 . 4 ) while grounding and then thawed on ice . Grounded worms were sonicated ( Branson ) and extract was clarified by centrifugation ( 50 , 000×g , 60 min , 4°C ) . Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus ( Thermo Scientific ) . For Western blot analysis , a minimum of 50 worms were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and washed with H2O . An equal amount ( w/v ) of nematode solubilization buffer ( 0 . 3% ( v/v ) ethanolamine , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF , 5 mM DTT ) was added . The sample was sonicated for 20 min in a Bioruptor using 30 s intervals ( Diagenode ) . An equal volume of 2x protein sample buffer was added . After boiling for 5 min , the extract was clarified by centrifugation ( 16 , 000×g , 10 min , 4°C ) . Individual hermaphrodites at larvae stage ( L3 – L4 ) were picked to NGM plates and transferred to fresh NGM plates at successive days . Progeny were counted at larval stage . The mean brood size and standard deviation of a particular strain was calculated and corresponds to the average brood size of all assayed hermaphrodites that were not sterile . Percentage of sterile hermaphrodites ( without offspring ) of particular strains was determined in parallel .",
         "Post-translational modifications ( PTM ) of histones , the proteins around which DNA is wrapped in chromatin , have been implicated in different biological processes ranging from transcriptional regulation to cell cycle progression . Many histone PTMs recruit specific proteins that translate their function into biological outcomes . Understanding the binding mode and molecular biology of these factors is key for our comprehension of epigenetic processes . In this study , we found that the Caenorhabditis elegans LIN-61 protein specifically interacts with particular PTMs on histone H3 , di- and trimethylation of lysine 9 ( H3K9me2/3 ) , which are implicated in transcriptional repression . LIN-61 contains so-called malignant brain tumor repeats ( MBT ) , which have been found to bind histone methyl-lysine residues in other proteins and model systems . However , these interactions are limited to the mono- and dimethylated states , and there is little to no sequence specificity for particular histone lysine residues . Importantly , H3K9me2/3 binding by LIN-61 is essential for the function of this factor within the synMuv pathway of C . elegans vulva cell fate determination . Besides identifying the first sequence and methylation state specific MBT protein , our studies define novel functions of LIN-61 and manifest a role of H3K9me2/3 in the synMuv pathway .",

         "Melioidosis is a problem in the developing tropical regions of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia where the the Gram negative saprophytic bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei is endemic with the risk of fulminant septicaemia . While diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for melioidiosis , little is known if specific hypoglycemic agents may differentially influence the susceptibility and clinical course of infection with B . pseudomallei ( Bp ) . In this cohort study , patients with pre-existing diabetes and melioidosis were retrospectively studied . Outcome measures: mortality , length of stay and development of complications ( namely hypotension , intubation , renal failure and septicaemia ) were studied in relation to prior diabetic treatment regimen . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from diabetic patients and healthy PBMC primed with metformin , glyburide and insulin were stimulated with purified Bp antigens in vitro . Immune response and specific immune pathway mediators were studied to relate to the clinical findings mechanistically . Of 74 subjects , 44 ( 57 . 9% ) had sulphonylurea-containing diabetic regimens . Patient receiving sulphonylureas had more severe septic complications ( 47 . 7% versus 16 . 7% p = 0 . 006 ) , in particular , hypotension requiring intropes ( p = 0 . 005 ) . There was also a trend towards increased mortality in sulphonylurea-users ( 15 . 9% versus 3 . 3% p = 0 . 08 ) . In-vitro , glyburide suppressed inflammatory cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner . An effect of the drug was the induction of IL-1R-associated kinase-M at the level of mRNA transcription . Sulphonylurea treatment results in suppression of host inflammatory response and may put patients at higher risk for adverse outcomes in melioidosis .\nMelioidosis is an environmental saprophyte endemic in tropical regions . The infection is caused by the Gram negative saprophytic bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei found commonly in environmental soil and surface water [1] . Clinical presentations of melioidosis include bacteremia , abscesses in any organ systems , pneumonia or soft tissue infection . The clinical course can be mild and chronic through to fulminant leading to septic shock and death [2] . Diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for susceptibility to melioidosis [3] , [4] . Approximately 50% of patients presenting with melioidosis are diabetics , the majority of whom are already receiving anti-diabetic therapy . However little is known if specific hypoglycemic agents , by themselves , may differentially influence the susceptibility and clinical course of infection with B . pseudomallei . This is important in light of recent knowledge that sulphonylureas ( glyburide ) and the biguanides ( metformin ) may possess modulating capabilities on host immune response [5] , [6] . It is known that the activation of host immune defence and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines against the pathogen is requisite [7] , [8] but opinion on the optimal cytokine milieu for facilitating an effective host response during melioidosis remains unclear [9] , [10] . Hence we aim to study whether commonly prescribed anti-diabetic medications , in particular the sulphonylureas by virtue of their ascribed immunomodulating potential , may influence outcomes in melioidosis . Consequently , we also will attempt to underline the mechanisms by which the specified drug may exert their effects on host immune response against B . pseudomallei .\nThe study was conducted at two of Singapore's largest hospitals , the National University Hospital and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital , each with more than1000-beds capacity . We identified patients diagnosed with melioidosis between January 2001 to December 2010 from the integrated hospital electronic medical record systems . A total of 116 such patients were identified , of which 15 subjects ( 12 . 9% ) did not have diabetes by history and laboratory investigation , while 27 subjects ( 23 . 3% ) were newly diagnosed diabetics upon presentation with melioidosis . The remaining 74 patients ( 63 . 8% ) had pre-existing type II diabetes and receiving medication prior to presenting with melioidosis and this was the study cohort being analysed . All patients received the recommended melioidosis treatment regimen consisting of an initial intensive therapy consisting of either ceftazidime , meropenem or imipenem intravenously for at least 2 weeks , followed by a prolonged oral eradication phase consisting of a combination of 2 oral agents from the 3 antibiotics: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( TMP-SMX ) , amoxicillin-clavulanate , doxycycline for at least 10 weeks [11] . Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the backbone of the 2-drug eradication regimen unless there were drug tolerance issues with individual patients . The patients were followed up for at least 12 weeks . Records of pre-existing diabetic medications were obtained from clinical notes and/or verified from computerised outpatient pharmacy archives . Most of the glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels were measured upon admission to hospital with melioidosis . When this was not available , the last known HbA1c level ( up to 3 months prior presentation ) was traced through electronic outpatient records . The primary outcome measure was mortality . The secondary outcome measures included length of hospital stay and measures of disease severity , namely: ( i ) hypotension requiring the infusion of inotropes ( ii ) respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation ( iii ) renal impairment with need for renal replacement therapy ( iv ) septicaemia as per defined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines [12] . The Toll like receptor ( TLR ) 4 ligand lipopolysaccharide ( LPS-EK Ultrapure , Escherichia coli serotype K-12 ) was purchased from Invivogen ( San Diego , CA ) . Metformin ( a biguanide ) , glyburide ( a sulphonylurea ) and human recombinant insulin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( Singapore ) and re-suspended in DMSO . The antibodies ERK 1&2 ( H-72 ) and p-ERK ( E-4 ) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc ( Dallas , TX ) . Overnight culture of B . pseudomallei , Bp22 , was inoculated into LB broth ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , Michigan ) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C until an OD600 reading of 0 . 8–1 . 0 . The bacteria was pelleted at 4000 g for 10 min and washed twice with 1X phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) , prior to reconstitution in 1X PBS containing 0 . 2 µg/ml leupeptin ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) , 0 . 2 µg/ml pepstatin A ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) and 2 . 5 Kunitz units of DNase I ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) . To extract bacterial proteins , the suspension was loaded into lysing Matrix B tubes ( MP Biochemicals , Solon , OH ) , and three rounds of homogenization was performed using Fastprep instrument ( MP Biochemicals , Solon , OH ) at a speed of 6 m/s for 30 s with a pause of 10–15 min in between for cooling . The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min , and passed through 0 . 22 µm filter unit ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA ) to remove any live bacteria . The supernatant was further purified and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal units with 10 kDa nominal molecular weight limit ( NMWL ) membrane ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . The final purified Bp antigen were recovered in 1XPBS , quantified by BCA protein assay kit ( Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL ) and used for further stimulation experiments . Separation and stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from healthy volunteers and diabetic patients was performed as previously described [13] . Blood was drawn into sodium heparin tubes ( BD Vacutainer Franklin Lakes , NJ ) after informed consent . PBMC were isolated by density centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Cells were washed , counted and adjusted to 5×106 cells/mL in culture medium ( RPMI 1640 DM supplemented with gentamicin , L-glutamine , and sodium pyruvate ) . Stimulation assays were performed in 96-well round-bottom plates using 100 µl of PBMC with the various stimuli and drugs to a total volume of 200 µl per well . PBMC were pre-incubated with metformin , glyburide , insulin or control media for 1 hour after which purified Bp antigen was added . After 24 h or 48 h of incubation in humidified atmosphere ( 5% CO2 ) at 37°C , the supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C until further assay . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-10 , IL-1β , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) and interferon- gamma ( IFN-γ ) were measured by commercial ELISA kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) . Detection limits were 20 pg/ml ( IL-1b , TNF-α and IFN-γ ) and 10 pg/ml ( for IL-6 and IL-10 ) respectively . PBMCs from healthy volunteers were treated with glyburide , metformin , insulin and the carrier medium ( DMSO ) for 1 h , followed by stimulation with purified Bp antigen for 30 mins . Whole-cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer and protein content was determined by the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) . 25 µg of lysates were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes . After blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk , the membranes were incubated with p-ERK ( sc-7383 ) , p-JNK ( #4668 ) or p-p38 ( #9215 ) primary antibodies . Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence detection substrate ( Pierce ) . The membranes were stripped and re-probed for total ERK ( sc-292838 ) , JNK ( #9252 ) and p38 ( #9215 ) . Western blot was also performed for MyD88 ( sc-11356 ) . Beta-actin ( sc-47778 ) was used as the loading control . Antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Cell Signaling were used . PBMC were incubated with glyburide , metformin , insulin and the carrier medium ( DMSO ) for 2 h prior to stimulation with purified Bp antigen for 30 minutes . Following stimulation , cells were washed twice with 1XPBS supplemented with 0 . 2% ( w/v ) BSA and stained with anti-CD14-V450 antibody ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) . Cells were then fixed with BD Cytofix ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and permeabilized using Perm III buffer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) for 30 minutes . The permeabilized cells were stained with mouse anti- p-ERK1/2 antibody ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , mouse anti- phospho-JNK antibody ( Cell signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) and goat anti-IRAK-M antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) . For cells stained with unlabelled goat anti-IRAK-M antibody , secondary labeling with donkey anti-goat-FITC antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) was carried out . Stained cells were then analyzed on FACSCanto flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and data analysis was performed using Flow Jo software ( version 7 . 6 . 5 ) ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . The expressions of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 ( IRAK-1 ) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M ( IRAK-M ) in PBMC primed with glyburide , metformin , insulin and control medium were determined . RNA was extracted from 107 PBMC by using 1 ml TRIzol reagent ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Subsequently , 200 µl chloroform and 500 µl 2-propanol were used to separate the RNA from DNA and proteins . After washing with 75% ethanol , the dry RNA was dissolved in 50 µl of diethylpyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) water . To obtain cDNA , we reverse-transcribed 1 µg DNase-treated total RNA with oligo ( dT ) primers ( 0 . 01 µg/ml ) in a reverse transcription-PCR mixture with a total volume of 20 µl . Quantitative PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad iCycler and SYBR Green . The following primers were used ( 5′-3′ ) : GTACATCAAGACGGGAAGGC ( forward ) and AGTGTGCTCTGGGTGCTTCT ( reverse ) for IRAK-1 , GTACATCAGACAGGGGAAACTTT ( forward ) and GACATGAATCCAGGCCTCTC ( reverse ) for IRAK-M , and ATGAGTATGCCTGCCGTGTG ( forward ) and CCAAATGCGGCATCTTCAAC ( reverse ) for β2 microglobulin ( B2M ) [9] . Quantification of the PCR signals for each sample was performed by comparing the cycle threshold values , in duplicate , for the gene of interest with the cycle threshold values for the B2M as housekeeping gene . All primers were validated according to the protocol . Mean relative mRNA expression was calculated using Pfaffl method . Values are expressed as a ratio of fold increase to mRNA levels of unprimed cells . The SPSS version 20 . 0 statistical software package was used to perform the calculations . In the cohort study , the differences between patient groups were analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact probability where appropriate , for categorical variables and the t-test for continuous variables . Adjustments for the effect of HbA1c and diabetic drug usage on outcome measures were performed using binary logistic regression . For the in-vitro experiments , results were pooled from at least 3 sets of experiments and analyzed , unless otherwise specified . The cytokine data was presented as mean±standard error of the means ( SEM ) . The differences in cytokine production were tested using Mann-Whitney U test . The level of significance was set at p<0 . 05 . Ethics approval for the conduct of the above study had been attained through the Domain Specific Review Boards , National Healthcare Group , Singapore ( no . 2012/00596 and no . 2012/00949 ) . Adult study subjects had provided written informed consent to participate in the study . There were no study subjects under the age of 21 years old .\nOf the 74 subjects with pre-existing diabetes on treatment and melioidosis , 44 ( 57 . 9% ) were taking a sulphonylurea group drug either alone or in combination with other diabetic medications . The demographics and outcomes of this group of patients were studied against patients who did not receive sulphonylureas as part of their diabetic drug regimen . As described in Table 1 , the background characteristics between the 2 groups of patients including immune status and renal function were similar . Glycaemic control as judged by their most recentHbA1c sugar control was similar between both groups ( 9 . 00 versus 9 . 59 , p = 0 . 353 ) . However , patient receiving sulphonylurea-containing regimens had higher incidence of secondary end points indicating severity ( 47 . 7% versus 16 . 7% , p = 0 . 006 ) . In particular , melioidosis patients on sulphonylurea were more likely to be hypotensive requiring inotropic support ( 29 . 5% versus 3 . 3% , p = 0 . 005 ) . The other analysed criteria showed increased tendencies for mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy . Similarly there was a trend towards increased overall mortality in patients on sulphonylurea ( 15 . 9% versus 3 . 3% , p = 0 . 080 ) . After adjustment for HbA1c , sulphonylurea usage remained a significant predictor of development of severity manifestations ( adjusted odds ratio AOR 4 . 89 , 95% confidence interval C . I . 1 . 37–17 . 5 , p = 0 . 015 ) . Mortality was not significantly linked to prior sulphonylurea exposure ( AOR 4 . 48 95% C . I . 0 . 49–41 . 4 , p = 0 . 186 ) even after HbA1c correction . Of note , concurrent insulin therapy was prescribed more in diabetic regimens not containing sulphonylureas , and the converse for α-glucosidase inhibitor . Melioidosis patients who had insulin as part of their diabetic therapy had a lower incidence of severe manifestations during infection ( 19 . 0% versus 41 . 5% , p = 0 . 104 ) . The use of metformin did not influence the clinical outcomes ( data not shown ) . To specifically elucidate the influence of the respective diabetic drugs on the immune response , PBMC from healthy volunteers were primed with metformin , glyburide and insulin and then stimulated with purified Bp antigen . Over a drug concentration range of 0 . 001 mg/mL to 0 . 01 mg/mL , glyburide clearly diminished the production of TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner as compared to Bp control ( in carrier medium ) ( Figure 1A–D ) . Conversely , insulin had a tendency to accentuate IL-1β response but this is only most evident at the dose of 0 . 01 mg/mL ( Figure 1B ) . Low dose metformin had a limited effect in enhancing TNF-α , IL-1β and IFN-γ production ( Figures 1A–C ) . To further validate the above findings in the patient cohort , PBMC from diabetic patients were stimulated with purified Bp antigen . We found that patients who had sulphonylurea in their treatment regimen for diabetes had a significantly weaker IL-1β response ( p = 0 . 04 ) as compared to patients who were on non-sulphonylurea containing regimens . The attenuative effects of sulphonylurea on the other cytokines in the patients were suggestive but not significant ( Figure 1E ) . Further to the above findings , we found that the attenuation of cytokine production by glyburide was effected upstream at the level of transcription . In the presence of glyburide , the IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA transcription was significantly reduced . In comparison , metformin and insulin induced minimal transcriptional changes ( Figure 2 ) . Because the suppressive effects induced by glyburide was generally seen with IL-1β , TNF-α and IL-10 and possibly not localized to a specific arm of the immune signaling pathway , we decided it was logical to study first , the major upstream adaptor molecule MyD88 and the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases JNK , ERK and p38 in the canonical innate signaling pathways . However we found that the expression of MyD88 , JNK , ERK and p38 were not affected glyburide-treated cells ( Figures 3A–D ) . Recently it has been proposed that elevated expression of IL-1R-associated kinase-M ( IRAK-M ) , a regulator of the inflammatory signaling pathway , was associated with adverse outcome in septic melioidosis [9] . The role of IRAK-M in the context of diabetes treatment and melioidosis , however , is not known to date . We saw increased expression of IRAK-M mRNA in glyburide-treated cells . The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 ( IRAK-1 ) mRNA expression was not affected ( Figure 4A ) . The effects of insulin and metformin on IRAK-M and IRAK-1 were limited . This was further confirmed on flow cytometery showing increased IRAK-M expression in monocytes exposed to glyburide ( Figure 4B ) . This up-regulation of IRAK-M expression reasonably accounts for the immune suppressive effects induced by glyburide , and the association with disease severity observed with sulphonylurea use in melioidosis .\nDuring an infection the capacity of the host to mount an appropriate immune and inflammatory response against the pathogen is pivotal . In the context of recent reports that diabetic medications like glyburide and metformin may possess inherent immune modulating capabilities , at least in the in-vitro setting [5] , [6] , we felt that it was important to study this further in the clinical context of melioidosis whereby diabetics are specifically predisposed to . In this study , we found that the use of a sulphonylurea-containing diabetes treatment regimen is linked to a more severe clinical course especially hypotension during melioidosis . This finding has implications for the large number of diabetics living in melioidosis endemic regions , particularly Singapore , Thailand and Northern Australia . The low cost of sulphonylureas , its availability and its relatively wide therapeutic window contributes to the popularity of the drug . While glycaemic control between the 2 treatment groups might have been a potential factor contributing to the difference in outcomes , we have shown that HbA1c was not a significant confounder of the results . We showed that glyburide had the capacity to suppress cytokine production . These effects were seen not only in-vitro in cells primed with the drug , but also similarly demonstrated in diabetic patients who were taking sulphonylureas . The importance of this latter finding is to be highlighted in that the differences in cytokine trends could still be elicited despite the numerous of confounders like multiple co-morbidities and polypharmacy in the clinical cohort . The attenuative effect on cytokine production was exerted at the level of mRNA transcription and one of the effects of glyburide was through the enhancement of IRAK-M which assumes a regulatory or inhibitory role in proinflammatory cytokine production in the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway though inhibition of nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB [14] . Conversely , IRAK-1 which up-regulates NF-kappaB , is suppressed . These findings on the mechanistic action of glyburide are novel as to date; glyburide is reported to act through the NALP3 inflammasome complex [5] . The response to infection by B . pseudomallei requires the host defence to first mount a prompt and effective innate immune response [7] . Results from our studies indicate that this capacity to mount an inflammatory cytokine milieu is compromised in the background presence of sulphonylureas in the body . This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that increased IRAK-M with consequent immunosuppresion was associated with poor outcome in melioidosis , though the specific aspect of diabetes and drugs was not looked at in that study [9] . The findings of our study is in contrast to that by another group [10] , who had reported reduced mortality , hypotension and respiratory failure with glyburide usage in melioidosis in Thailand . The group had hypothesized that the inhibition of the inflammasome and the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory process by glyburide might be beneficial in limiting sepsis-induced tissue injury and organ damage . Conversely , it is imperative that the host innate immunity be able to mount a robust inflammatory response against the pathogen during the initial phase of infection . The presence of sulphonylurea in the body compromises the immune response as we have demonstrated . Furthermore , such modulation of the IRAK complex as induced by sulphonylurea leads to susceptibility to infections as can be seen in patients with these genetic deficiencies [15] . In our smaller cohort of patients in Singapore , we were able to document diabetic drug history from our electronic records as well as the prescribed appropriate initial intensive therapy for at least 2 weeks followed by oral eradication therapy of at least 10 weeks as per recommended for melioidosis [16] . While HbA1c was not captured in the Thai cohort , we had sought to obtain the last known HbA1c of our patients and had factored glycaemic control into our analysis to show that sulphonylurea usage was an independent predictor of developing severe disease in melioidosis . In our study , the diabetic patients who were receiving insulin tended not to be prescribed concurrent sulphonylurea . This was expected as per prescribing practice in the management of diabetes . Our data suggests that patients on insulin might have a lower risk of severe septic manifestations of melioidosis . However we are cautious in not over-interpreting these results at this point as functionally , the immunomodulatory effects of insulin are not as clearly evident as compared to the suppression of cytokines induced by sulphonylurea . To validate these findings , the mechanistic effects of insulin need to be elucidated further . Diabetes mellitus remains the single most important risk factor for development of melioidosis . We find here that a sulphonylurea-containing diabetes treatment regimen suppresses the host inflammatory response and puts patients at higher risk for adverse outcomes . The implication of this finding may extend beyond melioidosis to other Gram negative septicaemia . Against the background of the popularity of sulphonylurea use in diabetes , this study highlights caution in the prescription of this class of drug especially in melioidosis-endemic regions .",

Diabetes mellitus is a recognised risk factor for melioidiosis; however little is known if commonly used anti-diabetic drugs may affect the clinical course of the disease . In this study , we found that patients who were receiving sulphonylureas for diabetic treatment had more severe septic complications requiring intensive care as well as increased risk of deaths . This may be attributable to the capacity of sulphonylureas in modulating the host immune response . We highlight caution in the prescription of this class of drug , which is popular due to its low cost and easy availability , especially in melioidosis-endemic tropical regions .",

         "The recent origin and great evolutionary potential of HIV imply that the virulence of the virus might still be changing , which could greatly affect the future of the pandemic . However , previous studies of time trends of HIV virulence have yielded conflicting results . Here we used an established methodology to assess time trends in the severity ( virulence ) of untreated HIV infections in a large Italian cohort . We characterized clinical virulence by the decline slope of the CD4 count ( n = 1423 patients ) and the viral setpoint ( n = 785 patients ) in untreated patients with sufficient data points . We used linear regression models to detect correlations between the date of diagnosis ( ranging 1984–2006 ) and the virulence markers , controlling for gender , exposure category , age , and CD4 count at entry . The decline slope of the CD4 count and the viral setpoint displayed highly significant correlation with the date of diagnosis pointing in the direction of increasing virulence . A detailed analysis of riskgroups revealed that the epidemics of intravenous drug users started with an apparently less virulent virus , but experienced the strongest trend towards steeper CD4 decline among the major exposure categories . While our study did not allow us to exclude the effect of potential time trends in host factors , our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing HIV virulence . Importantly , the use of an established methodology allowed for a comparison with earlier results , which confirmed that genuine differences exist in the time trends of HIV virulence between different epidemics . We thus conclude that there is not a single global trend of HIV virulence , and results obtained in one epidemic cannot be extrapolated to others . Comparison of discordant patterns between riskgroups and epidemics hints at a converging trend , which might indicate that an optimal level of virulence might exist for the virus .\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is a recent pathogen of humans , estimated to have jumped to the human species about 80 years ago [1] . The virus may still be adapting to humans , and this evolution may affect also its ability to cause disease . There is evidence for heritable variation in viral traits that influence the virulence of the virus ( severity of the infection ) [2]–[5] , which creates the conditions for the evolution of virulence . Multiple studies have attempted to assess time trends of HIV virulence , and have found increasing [6]–[11] , stable [12]–[17] , or decreasing [18] , [19] virulence . The discrepancies may arise either from genuine differences between the study populations or from differences in the methodology used to quantify virulence . Comparing results from different studies and assessing global trends require the use of the same methodology in different geographical areas and epidemics . Here we use a methodology developed for an earlier analysis of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study [17] , on an Italian cohort of comparable size . Our findings ( increasing virulence in Italy vs . stable virulence in Switzerland ) with the same methodology indicate that genuine differences exist between different epidemics . In addition , in the Italian cohort we found different patterns of virulence among the major exposure categories , indicating the possibility of relatively isolated sub-epidemics within the same country . Finally , we note that any measure of clinical virulence combines the effects of both host and virus factors , and must therefore be interpreted with caution . Our results are consistent with a time trend towards more virulent viruses ( either by local evolution or by the introduction and spread of more virulent viruses from other epidemics ) ; however , we could not exclude the effect of host factors .\nThe most direct measure of virulence available in untreated HIV infections is the rate of decline of the CD4 cell count in the blood . After a data selection procedure ( see Methods ) , the CD4 slope could be calculated for 1423 patients . The earliest date of confirmed infection ranged between 1984–2005; the median number of CD4 counts used in the calculation of the slope was 9 , the median baseline CD4 count was 596 cells/µL , and median age was 28 . 9 years at entry . The median CD4 slope was −50 . 4 cells/µL/year . The representation of the major exposure categories was as follows: intravenous drug-users ( IDUs ) 46 . 3% , heterosexuals ( HETs ) 36 . 6% , and men having sex with men ( MSM ) 17 . 1%; 31 . 9% of the patients were females . The CD4 slope displayed highly significant correlation with the date of confirmed infection ( Spearman's rank correlation test: rho = −0 . 16 , p<0 . 001; unadjusted effect: −1 . 7 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −2 . 3–−1 . 1 ) , in the direction of steeper CD4 slopes over the time span of the cohort . To account for potential confounding effects , we performed multivariate linear regression controlling for gender and exposure category ( reference levels were male and IDU ) , age at the date of confirmed infection and baseline CD4+ cell count; the primary variable of interest was the date of confirmed infection . The distribution of the CD4 slopes had very long tails , with 10% of the data responsible for about 70% of the range . To approach normality , we therefore discarded outliers below the 5% and above the 95% quantiles . 1279 patients were included in the main analysis; the characteristics of this group are summarized in Table 1 according to exposure category . Best model fit was achieved after merging the HET and MSM exposure categories . The effect of the date of confirmed infection was highly significant ( −2 . 0 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 7–−1 . 3; p<0 . 001 ) in the regression analysis , confirming the time trend toward steeper CD4 slopes . The effect of date on the virulence markers in the main analyses is summarized in Table 2 . The baseline CD4 count also had highly significant effect ( −0 . 048 per year; 95% CI: −0 . 058–−0 . 039; p<0 . 001 ) , indicating that the rate of loss slows down at lower CD4 counts , as has been observed before [7] , [12] , [17] . Furthermore , the HET and MSM exposure categories were associated with significantly faster CD4 decline compared with IDUs ( −27 . 6 cells/µL/year; 95% CI: −50 . 4–−4 . 9; p = 0 . 017 ) , and the interaction between the merged MSM/HET exposure category and the date of confirmed infection displayed borderline significance ( 0 . 90 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −0 . 0–1 . 8; p = 0 . 056 ) , indicating that the time trend may be less pronounced in these riskgroups . All other factors and interaction terms were dropped from the regression design due to lack of significance during model simplification ( see Methods ) . To further investigate potential differences between the riskgroups , we carried out separate regression analyses restricted to each category . The effect of date was strongest in the analysis of IDUs ( unadjusted effect: −1 . 7 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −2 . 4–−1 . 1; adjusted effect: −2 . 0 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 6–−1 . 4; p<0 . 001 ) , weaker among HETs ( unadjusted effect: −1 . 1 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −2 . 0–−0 . 3; adjusted effect: −1 . 3 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 2–−0 . 3; p = 0 . 008 ) and weakest in MSM ( unadjusted effect: −0 . 6 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −1 . 7–0 . 6; adjusted effect: −1 . 01 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 16–0 . 14; p = 0 . 086 ) , where it failed to reach significance . Factors for adjustment retained after model simplification were baseline CD4 count in all three riskgroups , and also gender and age in the HET exposure category ( not shown ) . The analysis of the point estimates of the CD4 slope per patient cannot account for the misspecification of the slope of any one individual . To ensure reliable estimation , we required five CD4 measurements for the estimation of the slope; however , this requirement introduced a selection bias against fast progressors , who cannot accumulate sufficient data points before starting therapy . We therefore assessed time trends in the CD4 slope also with a mixed-effect model fitted to the original CD4 count data . The model included the same fixed effects as the general linear model , plus random intercept and slope to account for the correlation of repeated measurements within each individual . We included patients with at least three CD4 counts; this more relaxed selection criterion increased sample size to 1889 patients ( the characteristics of this group are shown in Table 1 ) . The results of the analysis were consistent with the findings from the linear regression model ( Table 2 ) . The magnitude of virus load in the blood after the resolution of primary infection ( “viral setpoint” ) has been shown to correlate with the rate of disease progression [20] and was therefore chosen as our second measure of virulence . Following data selection ( see Methods ) , we calculated the setpoint for 785 patients as the mean log virus load in each patient . The date of confirmed infection ranged between 1996–2006; the median number of RNA measurements used for the calculation of the setpoint was 7 , the median baseline CD4 count was 560 cells/µL , and the median age at entry was 34 . 1 years . The median setpoint was 4 . 21 log10 RNA copies/mL . The representation of the major exposure categories was as follows: heterosexuals 51% , MSM 29% and IDUs 20%; 30 . 6% of the patients were females . The characteristics of the study group are summarized in Table 1 according to exposure category . The setpoint displayed highly significant correlation with the date of confirmed infection ( Spearman's rank correlation test: rho = 0 . 19 , p<0 . 001; unadjusted effect: 0 . 062 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 038–0 . 085 ) , indicating an increasing trend over time . To account for potential confounding effects , we performed multivariate linear regression controlling for gender and exposure category ( reference levels were male and HET ) , age at the date of confirmed infection and baseline CD4+ cell count; the primary variable of interest was the date of confirmed infection . The effect of the date of confirmed infection was highly significant ( 0 . 043 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 019–0 . 066; p<0 . 001 ) in the regression analysis , confirming the time trend toward increasing setpoints . Higher baseline CD4 count was associated with lower virus load ( −9 . 38×10−4 log10 RNA copies/mL/cell/µL , 95% CI: −1 . 25×10−3–−6 . 30×10−4; p<0 . 001 ) except among IDUs ( IDU × baseline CD4 count: 0 . 001 log10 RNA copies/mL/cell/µL , 95% CI: 5 . 55×10−4–1 . 45×10−3; p<0 . 001 ) . Female gender was associated with lower virus load ( −0 . 24 log10 RNA copies/mL , 95% CI: −0 . 38–−0 . 11; p<0 . 001 ) and higher age correlated with lower virus load in the IDU exposure category ( IDU × age at entry: −0 . 026 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: −0 . 036–−0 . 016; p<0 . 001 ) . All other factors ( including riskgroup ) and interaction terms were dropped from the regression design due to lack of significance during model simplification . To further explore potential differences between riskgroups we carried out separate regression analyses restricted to each category . The effect of date proved strongest among MSM ( unadjusted effect: 0 . 057 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 019–0 . 096; adjusted effect: 0 . 050 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 012–0 . 088 , p = 0 . 001 ) , weaker among HET ( unadjusted effect: 0 . 047 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 017–0 . 081; adjusted effect: 0 . 037 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 004–0 . 065 , p = 0 . 026 ) and weakest among IDU ( unadjusted effect: 0 . 042 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: −0 . 023–0 . 108 , p = 0 . 2; no factor had significant effect for adjustment ) , where it failed to reach significance . Factors for adjustment retained after model simplification included the baseline CD4 count for HETs and MSM , and gender in the HET exposure category ( with female gender associated with lower setpoint as in the main analysis ) . Because the distribution of setpoints displayed considerable negative skew due to a long tail of low setpoints , we repeated all setpoint analyses after discarding low setpoint values to ensure normality . The results ( including the effect of the date of confirmed infection ) were consistent with those of the analyses performed on the complete dataset . We thus observed consistent trends of increasing virulence towards both faster CD4 decline and increasing setpoints during the time span of the cohort . Because higher setpoints have been associated with faster disease progression [20] and faster CD4 decline [17] , we next asked to what extent increasing setpoints might have been responsible for the trend towards steeper CD4 slopes in our dataset . Estimates for both the CD4 slope and the viral setpoint were available for 484 patients . Consistent with earlier results , the CD4 slope was negatively correlated with the setpoint ( Spearman rank correlation test: rho = −0 . 20 , p<0 . 001; unadjusted effect: −11 . 8 cells/µL/year/log10 RNA copies/mL , 95% CI: −17 . 0–−6 . 6 ) . To dissect the contribution of increasing setpoints and other time-dependent factors to the trend towards steeper CD4 decline , we performed an extended regression analysis of CD4 slopes by adding viral setpoint as additional explanatory variable to the earlier regression design . However , because this subset had a much later median date ( due to the requirement of viral setpoint ) , we first tested the original multivariate regression design ( without setpoint ) . The effect of the date of confirmed infection remained highly significant in this more recent subset ( −4 . 4 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −6 . 2–−2 . 6; p<0 . 001 ) , and proved even stronger than in the main analysis . Further factors retained after model simplification included gender , baseline CD4 count , age and the interaction between gender and age . We then repeated the analysis including also setpoint as explanatory variable ( the effect of age and the interaction between gender and age were dropped due to lack of significance in this design ) . The effect of setpoint proved highly significant ( −14 . 4 cells/µL/year/log10 RNA copies/mL , 95% CI: −19 . 6–−9 . 3 , p<0 . 001 ) ; however , the effect of the date of confirmed infection also remained significant ( −3 . 4 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −5 . 2–−1 . 7; p<0 . 001 ) , and its strength decreased by only 22 . 2% compared with the analysis not controlling for setpoint . This result suggests that the bulk of the time trend towards steeper CD4 slopes was independent of variation ( increase ) in the setpoint . We tested also the inclusion of higher order terms in the setpoint into the regression model , but these proved not to be significant . Furthermore , calculating the expected effect of the increasing setpoints on the CD4 slopes by multiplying the unadjusted date coefficient of the setpoint ( 0 . 062 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , as obtained earlier ) with the setpoint coefficient of the CD4 slope ( −14 . 4 cells/µL/year/log10 RNA copies/mL ) yields a result ( 0 . 89 cells/µL/year/year ) that is consistent with the decrease in the effect of date ( 0 . 98 cells/µL/year/year ) upon the inclusion of the setpoint in the analysis of the CD4 slopes . Using mixed-effect models , we could repeat the analyses on a considerably larger patient set due to the less stringent selection criteria ( 1120 individuals had three of more CD4 counts and an estimate for the setpoint ) , and the effect of date was consistent with the results of the linear regression analysis ( Table 2 ) . We thus conclude that the observed increase in the setpoints had a relatively small contribution to the time trend towards steeper CD4 slopes . Finally , to visualize short-term trends in the virulence markers , we plotted a moving average of both markers ( Figure 1 ) . Each point in the graphs represents the averaged value of 50 patients and is dated to their mean date of confirmed infection . The figure reveals that the trends towards increasing virulence ( steeper CD4 slope and higher setpoint ) have been stable throughout the time span of the cohort , with short-term fluctuations superimposed over the underlying long-term trend . We also calculated moving averages of both virulence markers in the major riskgroups separately ( Figure 2 ) . This fine-scale representation suggests two stages in the time evolution of CD4 slopes within the riskgroups: in the first stage , IDUs lost their initial advantage of slower CD4 decline compared with HETs and MSM . After the convergence of the three categories , the second half of the observed epidemic has been characterized by a steady coupled trend towards steeper CD4 slopes in all groups . This observation also explains why the difference in effect of date between riskgroups lost significance in the more recent set of patients for whom virus load data were also available . Trends in the viral setpoint seem to be strongly coupled between HETs and MSM with a recent deceleration of the increasing trend; the setpoint of IDUs seems to have fluctuated with no clear trend . Fine-scale resolution of time trends by moving averages thus allows a better interpretation of the results of the regression analyses . In particular , the slower CD4 decline of IDUs was restricted to the early years of the epidemic , and the estimated faster trend towards steeper slopes reflects the early convergence of this riskgroup to the others .\nWe found robust time trends both in the rate of CD4 decline and in the viral setpoint towards increasing virulence in untreated patients of the MASTER cohort . Over two decades of observations , the rate of CD4 decline in newly diagnosed infections has almost doubled , while the viral setpoint has been increasing at a rate of about one log per 16 years since RNA measurements had become available . The finding of increasing virulence is consistent with some [6]–[11] , but not all [12]–[19] earlier studies of time trends of HIV virulence in various countries . Previously , it has been unclear whether discrepancies between studies of virulence arose from differences of how virulence was quantified , or they reflected genuine differences between geographical regions and cohorts . Importantly , we used a methodology adopted from an earlier analysis [17] , which found stable levels of HIV virulence in Switzerland , over approximately the same time span as was analyzed in the current study . The use of the same methods ensures that the discrepancy reflects genuine differences in the temporal pattern of virulence between the Italian and the Swiss cohorts . This observation indicates that there is not a single “global trend” of HIV virulence , and results obtained in one local epidemic cannot be extrapolated to others . It also implies that correlating different markers of virulence will require the study of the same population with the different methods . Of particular interest would be the correlation of clinical markers , as used in this study , and replicative capacity [10] , [19] as “top” and “bottom” measures of virulence . Replicative capacity is easy to measure for individual virus isolates; however , its relationship to pathogenic effects has been shown to be quite complex [21] , [22] . We note that our “empirical” measures of virulence reflect the combined effect of both viral and non-viral ( host or environmental ) factors , and our findings are therefore not direct evidence for virus evolution . In addition to the factors incorporated in our analyses ( gender , riskgroup , age ) , the progression of HIV infections has been shown to be influenced by host genetic factors [23] , co-infections [24] , [25] and socioeconomic factors [26] . Observed time trends could , in principle , reflect changes in any of these categories , and our data did not allow us to test or exclude the effect of such host factors . Our results are consistent with time trends in the viruses circulating in the cohort ( either by evolution or by repeated introductions ) , but do not provide direct evidence or test for this hypothesis . The ultimate goal for future studies would be to identify viral factors contributing to virulence . Transmitted drug resistance has been associated with faster CD4 decline in the first year of infection [27] , the spread of resistance mutations might thus also have contributed to the observed trend in the CD4 slopes . However , the same trend existed in the pre-HAART era and most patients in our cohort were probably diagnosed after the first year of infection , which indicate the effect of other factors . We have also tested whether the criteria for starting therapy have changed over the time span of the cohort: the last CD4 count before the initiation of therapy showed a temporary peak around the beginning of the HAART era , but no trend over the studied period . A further potential confounding factor arises from our data selection procedure , which required three RNA measurements and five CD4 counts in untreated individuals to qualify for the estimation of the setpoint and the CD4 slope . These criteria selectively remove fast progressors , who may not have sufficiently long untreated disease history to accumulate the required number of measurements . However , such biased sampling should actually dampen a trend towards faster progressors and cannot have generated the observed trends as an artefact . Using mixed-effect models for the estimation of the CD4 slope , we were able to use less stringent selection conditions , and obtained consistent results . Finally , the earliest date of confirmed infection probably has a varying time lag compared to the true date of infection in the patients , which introduces variation in the disease stage at entry and uncertainty in the timing of infections . To minimize the effect of variation in the disease stage , we discarded the data points potentially associated with late-stage disease , and we also explicitly accounted for disease stage by controlling for the initial CD4 count . Uncertainties in the timing of infections may have contributed to short-term fluctuations: in particular , the temporary reversal of the CD4 slope trend around 1996 ( Figure 1 ) might have resulted from an elevated proportion of slow progressors among the newly diagnosed cases due to increased willingness for testing after the introduction of HAART . However , the effect of fluctuations in the time lag must average out in the long run , and therefore cannot generate , nor hide long-term trends . We also found differences in the time trends of virulence between riskgroups , which raises the possibility that the epidemics of the main exposure categories might have been founded by independent introductions of the virus . The strongest effect was the finding of a faster trend towards steeper CD4 slopes among IDUs , who initially had the slowest CD4 decline among the riskgroups . This suggests a plausible scenario that the IDU epidemic was by chance founded by a virus strain of reduced virulence , and occasional contact between the riskgroups later transmitted more virulent ( and apparently fitter ) viruses into this group . This hypothesis could be tested in the future by phylogenetic analysis . Alternatively , the increase in virulence might have reflected viral evolution within the IDU epidemic . It has been observed that explosive epidemics ( characteristic of early spread in IDU populations ) are associated with slow HIV evolution [28] . The IDU epidemic in our cohort followed the same pattern: more than half of all IDU infections were diagnosed in just six years between 1985–1990 . Our findings are also consistent with a scenario that selection pressure to attain optimal virulence was weak in the early years of the rapidly expanding IDU epidemic , but intensified with the slowing of the expansion , driving virulence towards the levels already attained in the slower HET and MSM epidemics . Differences in the time trends of the viral setpoint were less pronounced between the exposure categories , and we have shown that the increasing trend of the setpoint had only a minor role in the time trend towards steeper CD4 decline . Finally , we note that the overall median of the rate of CD4 decline was faster in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study ( 55 cells/µL/year ) that had stable virulence than in the Italian MASTER cohort ( 50 cells/µL/year ) that showed increasing virulence . This observation and the finding of converging levels of virulence among the riskgroups of the MASTER cohort are consistent with , but do not provide direct evidence for , the hypothesis that HIV has evolved close to the level of virulence that is optimal for its transmission [29] , and local epidemics started by a founder virus of less-than-optimal virulence might experience an increase in virulence ( whether by local evolution or repeated introductions ) . In contrast , epidemics founded by more virulent viruses might exhibit stable or even declining virulence . We conclude that trends and patterns of HIV virulence may differ between geographical regions and even between different riskgroups within the same region . The results of individual studies can therefore not be extrapolated to predict the global patterns of the evolution of HIV virulence .\nThe Italian MASTER ( Management Standardizzato di Terapia Antiretrovirale ) Cohort is a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort comprising the general HIV patient population in referral centres throughout Italy . The analyses were restricted to patients of Italian nationality and white ethnicity for best representation of the local epidemics , and to the three major exposure categories: heterosexually infected patients ( HET ) , intravenous drug users ( IDU ) and men having sex with men ( MSM ) . Patients under age 15 were excluded from the analysis . Markers of virulence were defined as in [17] . Briefly , we calculated two markers of virulence in antiretroviral naïve patients: the linear slope of the decline of the CD4 count and the mean log virus load ( setpoint ) of each patient . Serial measurements of CD4 cell counts and plasma RNA determinations for all registered patients were obtained from the MASTER database . Only data points preceding the first initiation of antiretroviral treatment in each patient were included in the analysis . The infections were dated to the earliest date of confirmed HIV-1 infection in the patients . To eliminate confounding effects of primary and late-stage infection , we discarded data points obtained within 200 days after the earliest date of confirmed infection in each patient , and data points obtained after the first CD4 count below 100 cells/µL . The viral setpoint was calculated in patients who had at least three remaining RNA measurements spanning at least 100 days , as the mean log10 virus load per mL . The CD4 slope was estimated by linear regression in patients who had at least five remaining measurements of the CD4 count , spanning at least one year . We have verified that fitting linear decline slopes yielded smaller residual sums of squared errors than fitting exponential decline . Analyses of the CD4 slope and the setpoint were restricted to patients who had their original first CD4 count or RNA measurement obtained within one year of the earliest date of confirmed infection . We estimated the effect of the date of confirmed infection on the virulence markers by analysis of covariance ( general linear models ) . Categorical factors included gender and exposure category ( riskgroup ) ; reference levels were chosen to reflect the majority in the study groups . Continuous predictors included the earliest date of confirmed infection ( converted to Julian date ) , age at the date of confirmed infection and the baseline CD4+ cell count , defined as the first CD4+ count obtained at least 200 days after the earliest date of confirmed infection . The starting models included the interaction between gender and riskgroup , and two-way interactions between all pairs of a continuous and a categorical predictor . Significant effects were assessed by stepwise elimination of non-significant interaction terms and non-significant factors , and finally by merging non-significant levels of categorical predictors [30] . The time trend of the CD4 slopes was also investigated with mixed-effect models fitted to the CD4+ T cell counts ( relative to baseline ) from all eligible patients over time; the models accounted for the correlation of repeated measurements within each individual by random intercept and time slope . The primary explanatory variable was time since the earliest date of confirmed infection ( estimating the CD4 slope ) , and the models also included the interactions of the time with gender , riskgroup , the earliest date of confirmed infection , age at the date of confirmed infection , the baseline CD4+ cell count and ( in some analyses ) the viral setpoint , to account for the effect of these factors on the CD4 slope; and the 3-way interaction between time , date and riskgroup . Stepwise elimination of non-significant factors was performed based on likelihood ratio tests . All statistical analyses were performed with the R software package ( www . r-project . org ) . The datasets of both virulence markers were sorted into ascending order according to the date of confirmed infection of each patient . CD4 slope values below the 5% and above the 95% quantiles were excluded from the analysis . The average of 50 patients was calculated at a time , with the window of averaging moving along the lists of patients . The first point in each graph represents the average of the first 50 patients in the respective list; the second point represents the average of the patients second through 51st in the list , etc . Each average was dated on the horizontal time axis to the mean date of confirmed infection among the respective 50 patients .",
         "The AIDS epidemic claims more lives per year than any other infectious disease , even though its cause , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , is the youngest of all major human pathogens . The recent origin and great evolutionary potential of the virus raise the possibility that the virus might still be adapting to humans . Of primary interest is whether the virulence of the virus , i . e . its ability to cause disease , has been changing over time . Unfortunately , previous results have yielded conflicting results . We investigated time trends of virulence in the Italian HIV epidemic and found increasing virulence . The use of an established methodology allowed , for the first time , direct comparison with results obtained in other epidemics . The comparisons revealed that genuine differences exist in the trends of HIV virulence between different epidemics . Thus , there is no single time trend of HIV virulence worldwide . Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing HIV virulence; however , clinical virulence combines viral and host factors , and the effect of host factors could not be excluded in our analysis .",

         "Invariant representations of stimulus features are thought to play an important role in producing stable percepts of objects . In the present study , we assess the invariance of neural representations of tactile motion direction with respect to other stimulus properties . To this end , we record the responses evoked in individual neurons in somatosensory cortex of primates , including areas 3b , 1 , and 2 , by three types of motion stimuli , namely scanned bars and dot patterns , and random dot displays , presented to the fingertips of macaque monkeys . We identify a population of neurons in area 1 that is highly sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion and whose motion signals are invariant across stimulus types and conditions . The motion signals conveyed by individual neurons in area 1 can account for the ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of motion of these stimuli , as measured in paired psychophysical experiments . We conclude that area 1 contains a robust representation of motion and discuss similarities in the neural mechanisms of visual and tactile motion processing .\nIn both vision and touch , information about form and motion is inferred from a spatio-temporal pattern of activation across a two-dimensional sensory sheet ( the retina and the skin ) . The early stages of form processing have been shown to be similar in these two modalities in that both involve decomposing the stimulus into a set of local oriented contours [1]–[3] . Furthermore , the tactile integration of local motion cues has been shown , in psychophysical experiments , to be analogous to its visual counterpart [4] and the visual and tactile perception of motion have been shown to interact ( see e . g . [5] , [6] ) . In previous studies of motion processing in primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) , a population of neurons has been identified whose responses are modulated by the direction of stimulus motion [7]–[10] . Directionally sensitive neurons have been found in three areas of what is traditionally considered S1 , namely 3b , 1 , and 2 . The question remains how representations of motion are elaborated in these three cortical areas . In the present study , we investigate the representation of motion in S1 using experimental paradigms inspired by vision research . To that end , we deliver three types of motion stimuli—bars , dot patterns , and random dot displays—to the fingertips of Rhesus macaques while recording the responses these stimuli evoke in neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 . Stimuli are delivered using a 400-probe stimulator , the tactile analogue of a visual monitor [11] . Probes are indented into the skin in spatio-temporal sequences , analogously to pixels on a monitor , to produce verisimilar percepts of shape and motion . Because the spacing between adjacent probes is shorter than that between adjacent mechanoreceptors in the skin , the inherent pixelation of the array is not felt . The bars and dot patterns are scanned across the receptive field ( RF ) in each of 16 directions ranging from 0° to 360° . The random dot displays are the tactile analogues of stimuli that have been widely used in studies of visual motion [12] , [13] . In the tactile version , a set of five hemispheric dots move across the skin surface ( see inset of Figure 1C ) ; the degree to which the dots move in a coherent direction can be varied . At one extreme ( 0% coherence ) , the direction of motion of each dot at each point in time is determined randomly . In this condition , the display cannot and does not yield any holistic percept of motion direction . At the other extreme ( 100% coherence ) , all the dots move in the same direction , and the display yields a robust percept of motion direction . At intermediate levels of coherence , the probability that individual dots move in the prescribed direction is set ( at a level determined by the motion coherence ) between 0% ( chance ) and 100% . In a paired psychophysical study , we measured the ability of human subjects to discriminate the direction of motion of these same stimuli presented to their left index fingertips . The objective of the present study was to ascertain ( 1 ) whether a population of neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 conveyed motion information that was invariant relative to the spatial properties of the stimulus ( i . e . , its two-dimensional form ) ; ( 2 ) whether the direction signal was modulated by motion coherence ( in the case of random dot displays ) as has been found for neurons in area MT; and ( 3 ) whether the motion signal conveyed by a subpopulation of neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 could account for psychophysical performance across paradigms and stimulus types .\nWe recorded the responses of 20 SA1 and 11 RA afferents , and 92 , 148 , and 37 neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 , respectively ( peripheral afferents were tested only with scanned bars; only a subset of cortical neurons was tested with all stimuli ) ( see Table 1 ) . Figure 1 shows the responses of a neuron in area 1 to ( A ) scanned bars , ( B ) dot patterns and ( C ) random dot displays varying in coherence . The neuron responded most strongly when stimuli moved medial to lateral relative to the midline with a slight proximal to distal slant ( preferred direction = 20° ) . Importantly , its preferred direction was approximately the same across stimulus types , demonstrating that this neuron conveys information about stimulus direction that is invariant with respect to spatial form . Furthermore , the neuron's responses to all the random dot displays were equal when their coherence was 0% ( cyan rasters and tuning curve in C ) but direction tuning emerged and then sharpened as the motion coherence increased . To quantify the strength of tuning , we derived a direction selectivity index ( DI ) ( see Materials and Methods ) that increased from 0 to 1 as tuning strength increased . Figure 2A shows the cumulative histogram of DI obtained from the responses of peripheral afferents and neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 to scanned bars . Responses of individual SA1 and RA afferents were not tuned for direction as evidenced by the fact that they yielded DIs near zero ( Figure 2A; also see Figures S2 and S3 ) . In contrast , tuning for direction is evident at the earliest stage of cortical processing , namely in area 3b , which comprised a large proportion of neurons that were sensitive to the direction of motion of scanned bars . Direction tuning for bars was greater in areas 1 and 2 , which contained a much larger proportion of neurons that exhibited strong direction tuning than did area 3b ( Table 1 ) . Although direction tuning in responses to dot patterns was present in areas 3b and 2 , it was stronger for neurons in area 1 ( Figure 2B , Table 1 ) ( note that , although the numerical value of DI derived from responses to dot patterns tended to be higher for neurons in area 2 than in area 3b , many of the DIs derived from area 2 responses were not statistically reliable , as shown in Table 1 ) . Finally , neurons in areas 3b and 2 exhibited only weak direction tuning in their responses to random dot displays at 100% coherence ( Figure 2C ) , whereas the responses of a large proportion of area 1 neurons were strongly tuned for direction . Area 2 neurons exhibited particularly weak direction tuning to dot patterns , suggesting that these neurons are sensitive to edges; indeed , a large proportion of area 2 neurons are orientation selective ( unpublished data ) . Despite the fact that area 2 is higher in the somatosensory pathway than area 1 , it seems that the latter comprises a more robust representation of direction of motion than does the former . Next , we examined the effect of motion coherence on direction tuning in direction-sensitive neurons . We found that the increase in tuning strength was marginal for neurons in area 3b , whereas it was substantial for neurons in area 1 ( Figure 2D ) . The tuning strength of area 2 neurons exhibited an intermediate dependence on motion coherence , and direction tuning for these neurons only emerged at high levels of coherence ( >70% ) . We then wished to ascertain ( 1 ) whether individual neurons conveyed information about direction across stimulus types and ( 2 ) whether the direction signal conveyed by those neurons remained unchanged as the stimulus type changed . To this end , we identified a population of neurons that were significantly tuned for bars , dot patterns , and random dot displays . We found that no neurons in area 3b and 8% of the neurons ( 2 of 25 neurons ) in area 2 that were tested with all three types of patterns exhibited significantly direction-tuned responses to all three stimulus types . In contrast , 30% ( 14 of 42 ) of the neurons in area 1 exhibited significant direction tuning independent of stimulus type , with a large majority having the same preferred direction for all three stimulus types ( Figure 2E and 2F ) . The direction signal conveyed by these neurons was also largely insensitive to changes in the stimulus amplitude ( i . e . , the indentation amplitude ) , or scanning speed over a wide range of behaviorally relevant amplitudes and speeds . The strength of direction tuning was not significantly modulated by stimulus amplitude ( Figure 3A; F ( 2 , 705 ) = 0 . 4 , p>0 . 6 ) . Furthermore , with few exceptions , the preferred direction was the same across stimulus amplitudes ( Figure 3B , 84% of direction selective neurons yielded preferred directions that differed by less than 45° across the two amplitudes , in contrast to afferents; see Figure S3 ) . Similarly , while strength of tuning increased slightly but significantly with scanning speed across the population ( Figure 3C; F ( 3 , 540 ) = 7 . 3 , p< . 01 ) , the strength of direction tuning of individual neurons exhibited a wide variety of relationships with scanning speed ( Figure S4 ) , as did the strength of their responses ( unpublished data ) . Importantly , the preferred direction of individual neurons was consistent across speeds ( Figure 3D ) . As shown above , a subpopulation of neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 conveys significant information about direction of motion for each stimulus type ( Figure 2 ) . Can the responses of these neurons account for our ability to discriminate direction of motion ? We derived psychometric functions from clockwise-counterclockwise judgments obtained from human subjects and compared them to analogous “judgments” derived from the responses of individual neurons . Specifically , we used an ideal observer analysis to determine the extent to which stimuli moving in different directions could be discriminated on the basis of the responses these evoked in individual neurons . We found that the responses of the most direction-selective neurons in area 1 could account for psychophysical performance ( Figure 4 ) . ( We carried out this analysis using data only from neurons that were significantly direction selective for bars , dot patterns , and random dot displays . No neurons in area 3b and only 8% of neurons in area 2 met our selection criterion; see above . ) . Indeed , the direction of motion of bars , dot patterns , and random dots could be distinguished on the basis of the responses of a subpopulation of neurons in area 1 with the same accuracy as that observed in human psychophysical experiments ( Figure 4A–C , also see Figure S5 ) . Furthermore , the sensitivity of the direction signal to motion coherence mirrored that of human subjects ( Figure 4D ) . Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that area 1 comprises a population of neurons whose responses underlie our ability to perceive the direction of tactile motion . However , the neuronal and behavioral data were obtained from different species; this hypothesis could be tested in future experiments by assessing whether electrically stimulating clusters of direction selective neurons systematically affects the animal's performance in a direction discrimination task [14] or by ascertaining whether the responses of direction selective neurons are predictive of a monkey's behavior [15] , [16] . A hallmark of many visual neurons is that they are sensitive to both direction of motion and stimulus orientation . We ascertained the extent to which neurons exhibited this dual sensitivity by examining their responses to scanned and indented bars . Specifically , we gauged the strength of orientation and of direction tuning in the responses of each neuron in our sample to scanned bars . We found that these neurons spanned the spectrum of tuning properties ( Figure 5A ) . Some neurons ( 15% ) were sensitive to orientation and not direction ( Figure 5B ) ; others ( 36% ) were sensitive to direction but not orientation ( Figure 5C ) . A large proportion of neurons ( 32% ) , however , were sensitive to both; for example , the neuron shown in Figure 5D responded to a bar oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the finger regardless of whether the bar moved proximal to distal ( 90° ) or distal to proximal ( 270° ) , but produced a more robust response in the latter direction than in the former . In area MT , the relative preferred directions and orientations vary widely . However , the preferred direction is often perpendicular to the preferred orientation [17] . We tested whether this was the case for area 1 neurons by comparing the preferred orientation , measured from the responses to indented bars , to the preferred direction ( measured from the responses to scanned dot patterns ) . We found that , indeed , neurons that were sensitive to both orientation and direction exhibited a variety of relative orientation and direction preferences , with a tendency for orthogonal preferences ( Figure 5E ) . In summary , area 1 comprises a population of neurons that are strongly tuned for stimulus direction and whose tuning is invariant with respect to three major stimulus properties , namely spatial form , speed , or intensity . Furthermore , the responses of these neurons can account for the ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of moving stimuli across a range of conditions . Finally , a large population of neurons is tuned to both stimulus direction and orientation , with the preferred direction predominantly orthogonal to the preferred orientation . These neurons are specialized detectors for moving contours and thus have RF properties that are strongly analogous to those of neurons in primary visual cortex or area MT . As individual mechanoreceptive afferents are not sensitive to stimulus motion , an explicit representation of motion must emerge at higher processing stages . Computational models have been proposed to describe how the isomorphic representation of the stimulus at the somatosensory periphery is processed to yield information about direction of motion . Direction selectivity has been thought to be conferred by asymmetries in the spatial layout of in-field inhibition ( also referred to as replacing or lagging inhibition [2] , [18] , [19] ) . However , in-field inhibition is stronger in area 3b than it is in area 1 [19] , while neurons in the former exhibit weaker tuning than neurons in the latter . Rather , we propose that direction tuning first emerges in area 3b , produced in part by in-field inhibition and perhaps by mechanisms such as those observed in early visual motion processing ( see e . g . [20] ) . This direction signal is then elaborated in area 1 to yield a more invariant representation of motion direction . Models of the neural mechanisms that produce increasingly invariant motion representations with respect to other stimulus properties at successive processing stages have been developed for the visual system ( e . g . , [21] , [22] ) . The similarity in the visual and somatosensory representations of stimulus motion suggests that similar mechanisms may be involved in developing these representations in the two modalities [4] . Interestingly , complex processing of motion signals , in some ways analogous to that observed in area MT , occurs in a primary sensory area . Note , however , that area 1 is not strictly a primary somatosensory area [23] . Indeed , thalamocortical projections to area 1 are sparser , target layer III rather than layer IV , and comprise finer fibers than do those to areas 3a and 3b [24]–[27] . Furthermore , neurons in area 1 also receive strong projections from area 3b [28] . Indeed , many neurons in area 1 have larger RFs than do neurons in area 3b and are thought to each receive convergent input from multiple 3b neurons [29] . They are also less linear in the stimulus displacement profile than are their 3b counterparts [3] , [19] , which may in part account for the invariance of the representation of motion direction they carry with respect to stimulus parameters such as spatial form and speed . Area 1 also comprises a strong representation of stimulus orientation [3] and texture [30] , which suggests that it serves other functions and is not a dedicated area for motion processing . The contiguity of form , texture , and motion representations in somatosensory cortex is not surprising given that motion is a hallmark of tactile exploration . Information about motion direction may indeed be necessary to resolve the spatial relationships between stimulus features during scanning [31] .\nStimuli were generated and delivered with a device consisting of 400 independently controlled pins arrayed over a 1 cm2 area [11] . This array allows us to generate complex spatio-temporal patterns that simulate the kind of stimulation generated when a finger contacts a surface or object . Bars , scanned dot patterns , and random dot displays at 100% coherence yielded strong motion percepts as reported in pilot psychophysical experiments . Subjects were also able to clearly discern the spatial structure of the bars and the dot patterns ( see Text S1 for a discussion of tactile acuity and skin mechanics ) . To gauge the strength of direction tuning in the responses to scanned bars and dot patterns , we used vector strength: ( 1 ) where R ( θi ) is the neuron's response to a stimulus ( bar or dot pattern ) scanned in direction θi [36] . Values of DI ranged from 0 , if for example a neuron responded uniformly to all scanning directions , to 1 , when a neuron only responded to stimuli scanned in one direction . The statistical reliability of DI was tested using a standard randomization test ( α = 0 . 01 ) . The preferred direction was determined by computing the weighted circular mean: ( 2 ) We wished to assess the degree to which individual neurons also conveyed information about stimulus orientation . To that end , we computed an orientation selectivity index ( OI ) , analogous to the DI: ( 3 ) ( see above for conventions ) . Values of OI ranged from 0 , if for example a neuron responded uniformly to all orientations , to 1 , when a neuron only responded to stimuli at a single orientation . The statistical reliability of OI was tested using a standard randomization test ( α = 0 . 01 ) . The preferred orientation was then determined by computing the weighted circular mean with a moment of 2: ( 4 ) We wished to ascertain the extent to which neural responses could account for our psychophysical data using a standard ideal observer analysis . For each neuron , we randomly sampled , with replacement , from one of the five neural responses evoked by a stimulus moving in its preferred direction and one of the 10 neural responses evoked by a stimulus moving in a direction shifted by |Δφ| degrees relative to the preferred direction ( there were five presentations of each stimulus and we assumed that ±Δφ are equivalent ) . We repeated this procedure 500 times and computed the proportion of times the response was greater in the preferred direction than when the direction was shifted by Δφ for each Δφ ( ranging from 0° to 180° ) . Thus , to obtain the relative distributions of neural responses at φp and φp±22 . 5° evoked in a cell whose preferred direction was 90° , we sampled , on each of 500 iterations , one response evoked by a stimulus moving in the proximal-to-distal direction ( 90° ) and one response evoked by a stimulus moving at 67 . 5° or 112 . 5° . We then computed the proportion of times the former was larger than the latter . The resulting neurometric functions provide an estimate of how well one could discriminate direction of motion based on the responses of individual neurons . A similar analysis was performed to compute the neurometric function for random dot displays at various coherence levels: At each coherence level , responses to stimuli at the neuron's preferred direction were compared to responses to stimuli at its anti-preferred direction . For the purposes of illustration , we fit the data shown in Figure 5B–D with orientation , direction , and combined orientation/direction tuning functions , respectively . For Figure 5B , we used a von Mises function ( circular Gaussian ) with a moment of 2: ( 5 ) where R ( θ ) is the neuronal response to a bar scanned in direction θ , θp is the preferred orientation of the neuron , and α , β , and δ are free parameters representing the depth of modulation of the response , the width of tuning for orientation , and the baseline response , respectively . This function denotes orientation tuning . For Figure 5C , we used a von Mises function with a moment of 1 , which denotes direction tuning: ( 6 ) ( see above for conventions ) . Finally , for Figure 5D , we used products of von Mises functions of the form: ( 7 ) where α , β , γ , and δ are free parameters representing the depth of modulation of the response , the width of tuning for orientation , the width of tuning for direction , and the baseline response , respectively . The preferred orientations of the three neurons shown in Figure 5B–D were perpendicular to their preferred directions as reflected in the fitted function ( there is only one parameter denoting preference , namely θp ) . We also fit summed von Mises and found that the fits were equivalent but required an additional parameter ( because orientation and direction tuning needed to be weighted independently ) .",
         "When we physically interact with an object , our hands convey information about the shape of the object , its texture , its compliance , and its thermal properties . This information allows us to manipulate tools and to recognize objects based on tactile exploration alone . One of the hallmarks of tactile object recognition is that it involves movement between the skin and the object . In this study , we investigate how the direction in which objects move relative to the skin is represented in the brain . Specifically , we scan a variety of stimuli , including bars and dot patterns , across the fingers of non-human primates while recording the evoked neuronal activity . We find that a population of neurons in somatosensory cortex encodes the direction of moving stimuli regardless of the shape of the stimuli , the speed at which they are scanned across the skin , or the force with which they contact the skin . We show that these neurons can account for our ability to perceive the direction of motion of tactile stimuli .",
