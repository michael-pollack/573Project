         "Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development , yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms . In the C . elegans germline , reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation . Here , we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway . This is surprising , since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors . Through a combination of genetics , tissue-specific transcriptome analysis , and functional studies of candidate genes , we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch . We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes , silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming . These findings have wide implications , ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling .\nCell-fate decisions are controlled , on the one hand , by intercellular signaling and , on the other hand , by intrinsic mechanisms such as epigenetic chromatin modifications . The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved and widespread signaling mechanism ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al . , 1999; Greenwald and Kovall , 2013 ) , which has been implicated in key cell-fate decisions such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Notch signaling has also been implicated in cellular reprograming . Upon inhibition of Notch signaling , the oncogenic genes KLF4 and cMyc become dispensable for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) from mouse and human keratinocytes ( Ichida et al . , 2014 ) . In this setting , Notch inhibits reprograming . Conversely , Notch signaling promotes transdifferentiation of pancreatic acinar cells to ductal cells ( Sawey et al . , 2007 ) , or the conversion of hepatocytes into biliary cells in liver primary malignancy intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) ( Sekiya and Suzuki , 2012 ) . Notch signaling can also affect reprograming in normal development . In C . elegans , signaling through the GLP-1 and LIN-12 Notch receptors impedes reprograming during embryogenesis and , during larval development , signaling through LIN-12 is required for the conversion of a rectal epithelial cell into a motorneuron ( Jarriault et al . , 2008; Djabrayan et al . , 2012 ) . The role of epigenetic regulators in cell-fate decisions has been studied mostly in pluripotent cells cultured outside of their normal tissue environment ( Meshorer and Misteli , 2006; Spivakov and Fisher , 2007; Lessard and Crabtree , 2010; Orkin and Hochedlinger , 2011 ) . Therefore , the epigenetic regulation of stem cell identity in intact tissues remains poorly understood . Additionally , the impact of external cues , for example signaling from a stem cell niche to the recipient cell’s chromatin remains equally unresolved . By contrast , C . elegans has been used as a model to study reprograming in an intact organism ( Horner et al . , 1998; Fukushige et al . , 1998; Zhu et al . , 1998; Fukushige and Krause , 2005; Ciosk et al . , 2006; Jarriault et al . , 2008; Yuzyuk et al . , 2009; Riddle et al . , 2013 ) . In this model , germ cells can be directly reprogrammed into neurons by depleting specific chromatin modifiers such as LIN-53 ( Rbbp4/7 ) or components of PRC2 , and by concomitant overexpression of the transcription factor CHE-1 , which induces glutamatergic neuronal fate in a process which we refer to as Germ cell Conversion ( GeCo ) ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we identify the Notch signaling pathway as a critical player in this reprograming model . This was unanticipated , since signaling through the Notch receptor GLP-1 ( henceforth GLP-1Notch ) from the somatic gonadal niche is known to maintain germline stem cell/progenitor fate ( Kimble and Crittenden , 2007 ) . To understand this novel , reprograming-promoting role of GLP-1Notch , we combined genetics with tissue-specific expression profiling . We identified genes regulated by GLP-1Notch , including genes recently shown to maintain the germline stem/progenitor cells ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , and unexpectedly , we found that many genes activated by GLP-1Notch signaling were also repressed by the cell fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PRC2 . We show that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target , utx-1 . Importantly , UTX-1 is a histone demethylase known to erase the gene-silencing methylation of histone H3 dependent on PRC2 ( Maures et al . , 2011; Jin et al . , 2011; Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , we propose that the GLP-1Notch–dependent induction of UTX-1 facilitates reprograming by alleviating PRC2-mediated repression of alternative cell fates .\nGerm cells can be converted into neuronal cells in intact C . elegans upon overexpression of the neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 , simply by depleting the chromatin modifier LIN-53 ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . This GeCo phenotype can be followed in living animals by monitoring a reporter GFP expressed from the gcy-5 promoter , which otherwise is induced in glutamatergic ASE neurons ( Altun-Gultekin et al . , 2001 ) . In contrast to the spontaneous teratomatous differentiation of meiotic germ cells , observed in the absence of specific RNA-binding proteins ( Ciosk et al . , 2006; Biedermann et al . , 2009; Tocchini et al . , 2014 ) , GeCo is preferentially observed in the pre-meiotic , proliferating germ cells ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Consistently , removing the proliferating germ cells , by inhibiting GLP-1Notch signaling , prevents GeCo ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) . However , because the proliferating germ cells were eliminated , these experiments did not address a possible direct effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on GeCo . We began addressing this issue by examining the gonads of animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . These gonads are filled with proliferating germ cells and , upon depleting LIN-53 and overexpressing CHE-1 , we observed that significantly more germ cells converted to ASE neurons ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . We refer to this enhanced GeCo as 'GeCo+' . Detailed quantification revealed that the GeCo+ gonads contained more than twice the number of converted cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . The nuclei of these converted cells were reminiscent of neuronal nuclei and the cells displayed axo-dendritic projection ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) , as previously described ( Tursun et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . To confirm that the GeCo enhancement depends on the canonical Notch signaling pathway , rather than an independent function of the GLP-1Notch receptor , we RNAi-depleted the transcriptional effector of GLP-1Notch signaling , LAG-1 ( Christensen et al . , 1996 ) . We exposed animals only after hatching to lag-1 RNAi in order to avoid sterility , which is caused when animals are subjected to lag-1 RNAi earlier ( Supplemental file 1 ) . RNAi-mediated knock-down of lag-1 strongly inhibited GeCo ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Importantly , under these experimental conditions , we did not observe any obvious reduction of germ cell numbers ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—source data 1 ) , suggesting a proliferation-independent effect of GLP-1Notch signaling on cell-fate conversion . To investigate this further , we tested GeCo efficiency on germ cells proliferating independently of GLP-1Notch signaling . We took advantage of mutants in which , in the absence of two meiosis/differentiation-promoting factors GLD-1 and GLD-2 , germ cells proliferate independently of GLP-1Notch ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998 ) . Specifically , we examined GeCo in the loss-of-function gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutants , which carried either wild-type glp-1 or the loss-of-function glp-1 ( q175 ) allele ( Austin and Kimble , 1987 ) . Both mutant combinations have previously been described to have tumorous germlines and impaired meiotic entry ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . In contrast to efficient GeCo observed in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) gonads , GeCo was strongly diminished in the gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads , despite the ongoing germ cell proliferation ( Figure 1D , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Counting the number of germ cells in these gonads revealed only a slight difference ( a 15% increase in the numbers in the double vs . triple mutant gonads ) , suggesting that the strong enhancement of GeCo by GLP-1Notch signaling cannot be explained by the increased number of germ cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Since it has been proposed that dividing cells have a higher propensity for cellular reprograming ( Egli et al . , 2008; Hanna et al . , 2009 ) , we also tested whether blocking the cell cycle would affect the observed GeCo enhancement in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads . As previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) , we used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment to block the cell cycle in the S phase . Blocking the cell cycle by HU did not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Combined , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch enhances GeCo independently from its role in promoting germ cell proliferation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 003Figure 1 .

All animals ectopically expressed the pro-neuronal transcription factor CHE-1 from a heat-shock promoter . glp-1 ( ar202 ) is a temperature-sensitive gain-of-function allele of the Notch receptor . Animals were subjected to either mock ( control ) or lin-53 RNAi .

( A ) For the quantification of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm only the GeCo category of wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) was used because GeCo+ animals already show an extensive area of the gonad filled with gcy-5::gfp-positive cells with usually >100 cells/gonad making reliable counting impossible . Notably , animals with a seemingly similar extend of GeCo in wt vs . glp-1 ( gf ) show a clear increase of gcy-5::gfp-positive cells per gonadal arm from approx . 10 in wt to > 30 in glp-1 ( gf ) . n ( wt ) = 75 gonaldal arms , n ( glp-1 ( ar202 ) ) = 221 gonadal arms . The background of the loss of function allele glp-1 ( q175 ) leads to a significant decrease in GeCo as shown previously ( Tursun et al . , 2011 ) . ( B ) A magnified view of gcy-5::gfp-positive ( nGFP ) cells , in a GeCo+ gonad from a glp-1 ( gf ) animal . The converted cells show axo-dendritic projections ( white arrow heads ) .

Blocking the cell cycle with hydroxyurea does not inhibit GeCo+ . ( A ) We used hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment for 5 hr to chemically block the cell cycle , which makes germ cells arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle . This arrest does not diminish the GeCo+ phenotype in glp-1 ( gf ) gonads upon lin-53 RNAi and che-1 ( oe ) . At least 150 animals were quantified per condition . P-values were calculated using Student's t-test: p1=0 , 1409; p2=0 , 4583 . Error bars represent SEM .

After 12 hr of HU treatment , the gonads contained , as expected , enlargement nuclei ( arrowheads ) ( Gartner et al . , 2004; Fox et al . , 2011 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 007 To understand the effects of GLP-1Notch on GeCo , we set out to identify genes regulated by GLP-1Notch signaling in germ cells . To conduct the analysis in morphologically similar tissue , we again took advantage of the gld-1 gld-2 double mutants that , combined with either loss-of-function or gain-of-function glp-1 alleles , have morphologically similar gonads , filled with proliferating , undifferentiated germ cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) ( Kadyk and Kimble , 1998; Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . We combined gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) mutations with either the temperature-sensitive loss-of-function ( lf ) glp-1 allele ( e2144 ) , or the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function ( gf ) glp-1 allele ( ar202 ) ( Priess et al . , 1987; Pepper et al . , 2003 ) . Because GLD-1 and GLD-2 regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level only , we expected that transcriptionally regulated GLP-1Notch targets could be identified in this background . To analyze gene expression , gonads were dissected from animals grown at the restrictive temperature in two independent experiments , and transcripts were analyzed with tiling arrays ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . We identified around 100 transcripts that were differentially expressed between the gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( lf ) ( Notch OFF ) and gld-1 gld-2; glp-1 ( gf ) ( Notch ON ) gonads ( Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . These changes were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR ( RT-qPCR ) on selected transcripts ( Figure 2—figure supplement2A , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Most differentially expressed transcripts were upregulated in the ‘Notch ON’ gonads , indicating a predominantly activating role of GLP-1Notch in germ cells . For simplicity , we will refer to the transcripts upregulated at least two fold in the Notch ON gonads as ‘Notch–activated’ . Some Notch-activated genes , such as sel-8/Mastermind , lst-1 , and epn-1/Epsin , have been implicated in Notch signaling in other cell types ( Doyle et al . , 2000; Yoo , 2004; Tian et al . , 2004; Singh et al . , 2011; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . However , it remains possible that , rather than being direct GLP-1Notch targets , some of the Notch-activated genes were upregulated as an indirect consequence of increased GLP-1Notch signaling . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 008Figure 2 . GLP-1Notch and PRC2 regulate common targets and are functionally connected . ( A ) Notch-activated genes are biased for the sex chromosome linkage . Left: Changes in transcript abundance in the ‘Notch ON’ versus ‘OFF’ dissected gonads ( genotypes explained in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B ) were analyzed by microarrays . Transcripts upregulated at least 2-fold in the ‘Notch ON’ gonads are marked in red , those downregulated at least 2-fold in blue . Selected transcripts verified by RT-qPCR in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A are additionally circled in black . Right: 5426 genes can be considered expressed in the gonad , based on the bimodal distribution of expression values . Only 3% of those expressed genes are X-linked . In contrast , nearly half ( 46% ) of the expressed and Notch-activated transcripts are X-linked ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 2B for numbers ) . ( B ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 interact genetically . Left: DAPI-stained gonads from animals of the indicated genotypes . The mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z- single mutant gonads have wild-type appearance at 20°C . The glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function mutants have an almost wild-type appearance at this temperature , except for an extended proliferative zone in the gonad , referred to as 'distal tumor' . At the same temperature , mes-2 ( bn11 ) M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) double mutants developed germline tumors in 32/32 of the examined gonads . The insets show close-ups from the indicated gonadal regions: the distal-most regions contain undifferentiated , proliferative germ cells in all mutants ( a , c , e ) . However , while the single mutants contain oocytes with characteristically condensed chromosomes in the proximal gonads ( b , d ) , the proximal gonads of the double mutants harbor proliferative germ cells ( f ) . Scale bar = 30 μm . Right: quantification of the phenotypes . 'Distal tumor' indicates the presence of an elongated distal proliferative zone ( approximately ½ of the distal gonad arm ) . 'Extended' tumor indicates an extended distal tumor , few oocytes , and frequently also a proximal tumor . 'Fully tumorous' indicates the absence of all differentiated cell types except for sperm produced during larval development . ( C ) GLP-1Notch and PRC2 target the same genes on the X chromosomes . The plots correlate changes in gene expression in M+Z- mes-2 mutants with changes in gene expression changes in M+Z- mes-6 mutants . Results are shown separately for X-linked ( left ) and autosomal ( right ) transcripts . Notch-activated genes ( red in Figure 2A ) are marked in red . Lightly shaded areas indicate transcripts that are at least 2-fold upregulated . The overlap between transcripts upregulated by GLP-1Notch and transcripts upregulated by the loss of CePRC2 is highly significant , particularly for the X-linked genes . The significance of the correlation was measured by hypergeometric distribution; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 31e-31; X-linked Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=7 . 41e-25; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-2 derepressed: p=1 . 47e-22; autosomal Notch-activated vs . mes-6 de-repressed: p=1 . 8e-12 .

Examining transcriptional effects of GLP-1Notch signaling . ( A ) GLP-1Notch signaling counteracts the meiosis-promoting activity of several RNA binding proteins , of which GLD-1 and -2 are indicated . ( B ) Mutants that were used in this study: while the loss-of-function ( lf ) alleles of glp-1 cause the loss of germ cells , gain-of-function ( gf ) alleles result in a constitutive proliferation of germ cells . However , in the absence of the meiosis-promoting GLD-1 and GLD-2 proteins , germ cells continue to proliferate in the absence of GLP-1Notch activity . ( C ) Three representative gonads of Notch ON: gld-2 ( q497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) and Notch OFF: gld-2 ( a497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( e2144 ) animals are shown after dissection and DAPI staining . The central planes of the gonads were imaged . Nuclei were counted from those images using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ . For each genetic background , germ cells in the entire gonad of 10 dissected gonads were counted . The quantification below revealed that the numbers of germ cells in both backgrounds are not changed . Error bars represent SD . Scale bar = 10 μm .

The PRC2 component MES-6 and most enhancers/suppressors of glp-1 ( ar202 ) induced tumors appear to interact genetically with GLP-1Notch signaling in a germline-autonomous manner .

Empty vector 1–3 represent three independent replicates of the empty vector control and demonstrate the robustness of the experiment . We observed that , for an unknown reason , the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) double mutants were less likely to produce tumors at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C . Nonetheless , the double mutant strain reacts to enhancers , suppressors , and depletion of PRC2 components in a similar manner as the glp-1 ( ar202 ) single mutant strain , with the exception of mbk-1 and B0416 . 5 RNAi . Depletion of mes-2 and mes-3 by RNAi was ineffective , since it did not enhance the tumourous phenotype in either of the two strains .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 013 To demonstrate that Notch-activated genes are functionally relevant for germ cell proliferation , we performed RNAi knockdown of Notch-activated genes ( n = 64 ) on animals carrying the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele , and screened for enhancement or suppression of the tumorous gonad phenotype ( Supplementary file 1; for detailed experimental procedure see Materials and Methods ) . Knocking down some of the Notch-activated genes suppressed the tumorous phenotype , which agrees with predominantly proliferation-promoting role of GLP-1Notch . Interestingly , knocking down a smaller subset of the Notch-activated genes enhanced the tumor ( Supplementary file 1 ) , suggesting that some of the Notch-activated genes may counteract proliferation . While some of these genes may function autonomously in the germline , others could affect the germline indirectly from the soma . To test this , we RNAi-depleted selected candidates in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) mutant background , which is permissive for RNAi in the germline but deficient in RNAi in many ( but not all ) somatic tissues ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . While depleting most candidates in the rrf-1 background had similar effects on the germline as in the wild type ( suggesting germline-autonomous function ) , in some cases the effects were abolished , suggesting that these genes function in the soma ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Strikingly , we noticed that Notch-activated genes were enriched on the X-chromosome , the C . elegans sex chromosome . 45% of the Notch-activated genes were X-linked , which is four-fold more than expected by chance ( p=2 . 99e-14; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . When analyzing only genes with higher than baseline germline expression values , the disproportional X-linkage of Notch-activated genes was even more striking ( fifteen times more than expected by chance ( p=2 , 19e-38; Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . In the C . elegans germline , X-linked genes are largely silenced by the C . elegans PRC2 ( Fong et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the X chromosome bias among Notch-activated genes suggested a possible antagonistic relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 . The C . elegans PRC2 consists of MES-2 , -3 , and -6 ( Bender et al . , 2004 ) and levels of the corresponding transcripts were essentially not altered by GLP-1Notch signaling ( mes-2: absolute fold change ( fc ) -1 . 3747; mes-3: fc 1 . 003; mes-6: fc 1 . 037 ) . To test for a functional relationship between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we examined genetic interactions between GLP-1 and PRC2 mutants . At 20°C , both the temperature-sensitive gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) and the homozygous loss-of-function mes-2 ( bn11 ) mutants , derived from heterozygous mothers providing maternal MES-2 ( mes-2 M+Z- mutants ) , were viable and produced gonads with nearly wild-type appearance . The double mes-2 M+Z-; glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , however , displayed distal and proximal tumors at the same temperature ( Figure 2B; 32/32 examined gonads ) . PRC2 and GLP-1Notch thus interact functionally , and they appear to do so in a germ cell autonomous manner ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Given the striking enrichment of Notch-activated genes on the X chromosome , and the genetic interaction between PRC2 and GLP-1Notch , we speculated that GLP-1Notch and PRC2 act on similar genes . To determine whether Notch-activated genes are also PRC2-repressed , we first determined putative PRC2 targets by expression analyses on isolated wild-type , M+Z- mes-2 or mes-6 mutant gonads ( GEO accession number GSE49395 ) . Consistent with the joint function of MES-2 and MES-6 in the PRC2 complex , a very similar set of genes was upregulated upon the loss of either protein ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—source data 1; henceforth ‘PRC2 repressed’ genes; also see ( Gaydos et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , those PRC2-repressed genes overlapped strongly with Notch-activated genes , particularly those linked to the X chromosome . Nearly all of the X-linked Notch-activated genes were also derepressed upon the loss of PRC2 ( Figure 2C ) . This is consistent with the observed genetic interaction and suggests that increased GLP-1Notch signaling can induce expression of specific PRC2-repressed genes . This activation of the PRC2-repressed genes is not due to a global loss of the repressive tri-methylation of Histone H3 at lysine residue 27 ( H3K27me3 ) , since , upon examining gonads of different GLP-1Notch mutants , we observed no global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . Germ cell conversion to neurons can be triggered not only by LIN-53 depletion but also by the depletion of PRC2 ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Potentially , the depletion of LIN-53 could facilitate reprograming by inhibiting PRC2 , since the depletion of LIN-53 results in a global loss of H3K27me3 in the germline ( Patel et al . , 2012 ) . Considering the antagonistic relation between GLP-1Notch and PRC2 on cell proliferation and gene regulation , we wondered whether GeCo triggered by the depletion of PRC2 would be sensitive to Notch signaling . Indeed , GeCo was strongly enhanced in PRC2-depleted ( mes-2 , mes-3 or mes-6 RNAi ) animals , when they also carried the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) allele ( Figure 3A , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Moreover , similar to the LIN-53–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 1D ) , the loss of GLP-1 effectively prevented GeCo in PRC2–depleted gld-1 ( q497 ) gld-2 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( q175 ) gonads ( Figure 3B , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Together , these results suggest that GLP-1Notch stimulates GeCo in PRC2-compromised gonads . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 014Figure 3 . GLP-1Notch enhances reprograming upon the depletion of PRC2 . ( A ) Notch and PRC2 genetically interact in GeCo . Left: Fluorescent micrographs of glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function mutants expressing CHE-1–induced neuronal GFP . The animals were subjected to control RNAi or RNAi against PRC2 components ( MES-2 , 3 , and 6 ) , as indicated . Increased GLP-1Notch signaling enhanced the GeCo+ phenotype upon PRC2 depletion .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 015 To determine how GLP-1Notch might counteract PRC2 , we depleted candidate Notch-activated genes ( Supplementary file 1 ) , and examined GeCo efficiency ( Figure 4A , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The strongest suppression of the GeCo+ and GeCo phenotype was observed upon the depletion of utx-1 , which also suppressed mes-3 RNAi-mediated GeCo+ in glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Depletion of two other candidates , the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the aldolase ortholog aldo-1 , also suppressed GeCo+ , albeit less efficiently ( Figure 4A ) . Because UTX-1 was suggested to effect gonadal development by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) , we re-examined GeCo efficiency upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) background . Importantly , in rrf-1 mutants , RNAi is impaired in the somatic gonad , including the distal tip cell ( DTC ) , which constitutes the germline stem cell niche ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . Because the suppression of GeCo+ upon utx-1 RNAi was observed also in the rrf-1 background , UTX-1 does not seem to enhance GeCo by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . Furthermore , different genetic backgrounds and RNAi agains utx-1 do not affect the expression levels of CHE-1 in the germline ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 016Figure 4 . The H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 is required for GeCo enhancement . ( A ) UTX-1 is critical for GeCo enhancement . Candidate Notch-activated genes , selected from Supplementary file 2 with available RNAi clones , were assayed for a role in GeCo in glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals , expressing CHE-1–induced nGFP and treated with lin-53 RNAi . While the additional depletion of utx-1 had the strongest impact on GeCo+ and GeCo , the depletion of C07G1 . 6 and aldo-1 had a weaker effect .

Only RNAi against jmjd-1 . 2 suppresses GeCo+ , though to a lesser degree compared to utx-1 RNAi . Representative fluorescence micrographs are below the quantification chart .

UTX-1 is required for the GeCo+ enhancement upon the depletion of PRC2 . ( A ) Adult glp-1 ( ar202 ) animals treated with lin-53 or mes-3 RNAi were additionally subjected to either control or utx-1 RNAi . Depletion of utx-1 strongly suppressed the GeCo+ phenotype . Suppression upon utx-1 co-depletion with lin-53 is also detectable in the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) background which is permissive for RNAi in the germline but not in the somatic gonad and the DTC . Right: quantification: n = 715 were scored for lin-53; utx-1 RNAi; n = 500 for mes-3; utx-1 RNAi and n = 270 were scored for lin-53; utx-1 RNAi in rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) .

As additional controls the strain otIs305 ( hspprom::che-1::3xHA ) ntIs1 ( gcy-5prom::gfp ) with or without lin-53 RNAi and heat shock treatment was used .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 018 Importantly , utx-1 encodes a conserved H3K27me3 demethylase , an enzyme erasing the repressive mark deposited by PRC2 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Jin et al . , 2011; Maures et al . , 2011 ) , potentially explaining how its depletion impairs GeCo efficiency . However , a number of other H3K27me3 demethylases exist in C . elegans , which prompted us to test whether depletion of these demethylases might have an effect on GeCo in the glp-1 ( ar202 ) gonads . We RNAi-depleted jmjd-1 . 2 , encoding a H3K9/27me2 demethylase ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , jmjd-3 . 1 , jmjd-3 . 2 , and jmjd-3 . 3 , which were reported to demethylate H3K27me2/3 ( Agger et al . , 2007; Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010; Zuryn et al . , 2014 ) , and , as a control , jmjd-2 , encoding a H3K9/36 demethylase ( Whetstine et al . , 2006; Greer et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . Only the depletion of JMJD-1 . 2 suppressed GeCo+ significantly , though to a lesser degree than the depletion of UTX-1 ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The suppression of GeCo by the depletion of UTX-1 or JMJD-1 . 2 stresses the importance of counteracting PRC2 in reprograming . However , only the expression of utx-1 is activated by the GLP-1Notch signaling , suggesting that it is the activity of UTX-1 which is key for the reprograming dependent on GLP-1Notch signaling . The inhibition of GeCo enhancement upon utx-1 RNAi in the rrf-1 background suggested that UTX-1 functions in the germline . To test the potential expression of utx-1 in the germline , we constructed a strain expressing single copy-integrated , FLAG and GFP-tagged , functional UTX-1 ( expressed from the endogenous utx-1 promoter under the control of endogenous utx-1 3'UTR ) . We found that this protein was indeed expressed in the germline ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . To examine the potential transcriptional regulation of utx-1 expression by GLP-1Notch and PRC2 , we also created a strain expressing GFP-tagged histone H2B from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1 reporter ) , under the control of an unregulated ( tbb-2 ) 3’UTR . This construct was also single-copy integrated into a defined genomic location . With both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter , we expected expression patterns similar to that of other reported GLP-1Notch target genes ( Lamont et al . , 2004; Lee et al . , 2006; Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Among these , lst-1 and sygl-1 account for the role of GLP-1Notch in stem cell maintenance , and both genes are expressed in the distal-most stem cells/progenitors ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . By contrast , both the UTX-1 fusion protein and the putx-1 reporter were little or not expressed in the distal-most , proliferative part of the germline ( Figure 5A–C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Concomitantly with progression through meiosis , their expression increased toward the proximal end of the gonad ( Figure 5A–C ) . When examining the existing mRNA hybridization patterns of Notch-activated and PRC2-repressed genes ( 33 genes ) , we noticed that half of these ( 18 , all X-linked ) are similarly expressed in the medial and/or proximal , but not the distal-most , gonads ( Supplementary file 2 ) , arguing against direct transcriptional activation of these genes by GLP-1Notch in the wild type . Nevertheless , in agreement with the expression analyses , we observed increased expression of the putx-1 reporter in PRC2-depleted gonads; this increase occurred throughout the gonad , including the distal-most region ( Figure 5A ) . In situ hybridization for the endogenous utx-1 transcript also showed increased expression throughout the gonad in the absence of PRC2 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , expression of the putx-1 reporter was higher upon increased GLP-1Notch activity in glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutants , including the distal-most region where , in the wild type , utx-1 is little or not expressed ( Figure 5B ) . Importantly , we found that the activation of the utx-1 promoter by Notch signaling was depended on the putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites within the promoter ( Yoo et al . , 2004 ) , as deleting those sites reduced reporter expression by approximately one-fourth ( Figure 5C ) . The interaction between LAG-1 and utx-1 was also tested by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) , performed on a strain expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 in either wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background ( Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) ; the previously identified GLP-1Notch targets , lst-1 and sygl-1 ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) , served as positive controls for the ChIP . Expectedly , we observed the enhanced binding of LAG-1 to the utx-1 promoter , indicating that utx-1 is a transcriptional target of GLP-1Notch signaling . Summarizing , based on the observations in mutant backgrounds , PRC2 and GLP-1Notch signaling have antagonistic effects on utx-1 transcription . However , in wild type , the endogenous levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are apparently insufficient to overcome PRC2-mediated repression of utx-1 in the distal-most part of the gonad . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15477 . 019Figure 5 .

Top: dissected gonads expressing a GFP reporter , driven from the utx-1 promoter ( putx-1::GFP , fused to histone 2B for nuclear localization to facilitate quantification ) , subjected to the indicated RNAi ( A ) , crossed into the indicated genetic background ( B ) or carrying the indicated mutations in the reporter gene ( C ) . a , b , and c indicate gonadal regions containing germ cells in mitosis ( a ) , and leptotene/zygotene ( b ) or pachytene ( c ) stages of meiosis . Below: the corresponding GFP quantifications . The diagrams show GFP intensities relative to the control ( indicated by green arrows ) in regions a-c . Results are represented as average changes in the GFP intensity ( relative to mock RNAi-ed or untreated animals ) . The error bars represent SEM . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for the LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . ( A ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is repressed by PRC2 . In all mes-depleted gonads , the reporter was de-repressed in proliferating cells ( a ) as well as in more proximal gonadal regions ( b-c ) . ( B ) The putx-1::GFP reporter is upregulated by GLP-1Notch . In the gain-of-function glp-1 ( ar202 ) mutant , the reporter was strongly derepressed in the proliferating cells in the distal-most gonad ( a ) . Its expression was also increased in the more proximal regions ( b-c ) , which , in this mutant background , contain proliferating cells instead of meiotic cells . ( C ) putx-1::GFP expression depends on the predicted LAG-1/CSL binding sites in the promoter . Upon deletion of putative LAG-1/CSL binding sites , the reporter expression was abolished . The changes in GFP intensities were highly significant ( p-values were measured by independent t-tests ) p1=4 . 85–13 , p2=1 . 38–20 , p3=1 . 18–7 . ( D ) LAG-1 binds the utx-1 promoter . Lysates of animals expressing FLAG-tagged LAG-1 ( strain wgIs591; lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ) , either in wild-type or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background , were subjected to ChIP-qPCR analysis of the indicated genes . Negative controls and additional tested genes are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 . The qPCR amplicons were tested in at least three independent experiments . The results are shown as fold enrichment in anti-FLAG IP compared to IP with unspecific antibody . The 3’UTR of lst-1 serves as a negative control . Interestingly , LAG-1 binding in the glp-1 ( ar202 ) gain-of-function background is stronger to the utx-1 promoter than to the reported GLP-1Notch targets lst-1 and sygl-1 .

Worm lysates ( corresponding to 4 mg protein ) of animals , with or without lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ( wgIs591 ) transgene , were used for ChIP . Samples were incubated with 50 µl of FLAG ( ‘specific’ FLAG antibody ) or HA antibodies ( ‘unspecific’ HA antibody ) coupled to µMACS microbeads ( Milteny ) . As negative control , lysate N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) worm lysates , which do not express the recombinant target protein , were used . Both negative control lysates did not show any differences during the ChIP experiment when tested with either specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to µMACS beads ) or unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to µMACS beads ) . Lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein in N2 or glp-1 ( ar202 ) background were incubated with specific ( anti-FLAG ) and unspecific ( anti-HA ) antibodies coupled to µMACS beads . The qPCR amplicons were tested in a minimum of three independent ChIP-qPCR experiments . Quantification results are shown as fold enrichment of anti-FLAG µMACS™ beads using wgIs591 lysate over anti-FLAG µMACS beads using lysate without wgIs591 ( no lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG ) . Primer for qPCRs ( sequence details above ) were designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) . The FLAG-beads using lysates with lag-1::TY1::EGFP::3xFLAG show specific enrichment for tested target genes thereby validating the specificity of the ChIP .

Here , we report an unexpected role of GLP-1Notch signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming . To understand this phenomenon , we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . While the identified genes include the physiological GLP-1Notch targets , sygl-1 and lst-1 , many other genes , including utx-1 , appear to be only weakly or not expressed in the distal-most region of the wild-type gonad , where both sygl-1 and lst-1 are induced by GLP-1Notch ( Kershner et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , the wild-type levels of GLP-1Notch signaling are either insufficient to induce expression of many potential target genes ( see below ) , or their expression is controlled by additional mechanisms , perhaps similarly to lip-1 mRNA , which , while induced by GLP-1Notch , is post-transcriptionally degraded in the distal-most gonad ( Hajnal and Berset , 2002; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to its major proliferation-promoting function , GLP-1Notch has been suggested to have a lesser role in promoting germ cell differentiation ( Hansen et al . , 2004 ) . Some of the identified Notch-activated genes appear to promote germ cell differentiation , potentially explaining the proposed differentiation-promoting function of GLP-1Notch . However , whether these genes are activated by GLP-1Notch and promote differentiation under physiological conditions remains to be determined . Many of the Notch-activated genes are repressed by PRC2 , suggesting that the expression of these genes is determined by the crosstalk between the extrinsic intercellular signaling pathway , Notch , and the intrinsic chromatin modifier PRC2 . Indeed , at least in the case of utx-1 , PRC2 appears to prevent its inappropriate expression in the distal-most gonad , which , nevertheless , can be overcome upon increased GLP-1Notch signaling . Our findings suggest that GLP-1Notch antagonizes PRC2 , at least in part , by stimulating expression of the H3K27 demethylase UTX-1 , which is essential for the enhancement of cellular reprograming . Previously , it was suggested that UTX-1 influences the germline by functioning in the somatic gonad ( Vandamme et al . , 2012 ) . However , by using the rrf-1 background , which displays defective RNAi in the somatic gonad , including the DTC ( Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , we found that the reprograming-promoting role of UTX-1 is unlikely to depend on its function in the somatic gonad . Although we cannot fully exclude the possibility that the reprograming-facilitating role of UTX-1 depends on its expression in another somatic tissue ( such as the intestine , in which RNAi remains functional in the rrf-1 mutant; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , the germline expression of UTX-1 reported here suggests a germline-autonomous function . Consistent with this hypothesis , manipulating either PRC2 or GLP-1Notch affected the germline expression of utx-1 . Although additional factors , such as the uncharacterized C07G1 . 6 and the ortholog of the human aldolase A ( Kuwabara and O'Neil , 2001; Shaye and Greenwald , 2011 ) might contribute to reprograming , they appear to be less critical . In addition to UTX-1 , another H3K27/H3K9-demethylating enzyme , JMJD-1 . 2 ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) , is required for enhanced reprograming . Similar to UTX-1 , JMJD-1 . 2 is likely to be directly involved in regulating chromatin accessibility , since its depletion results in increased levels of the repressive H3K9me2 and H3K27me2 modifications ( Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al . , 2010 ) . The reprograming-promoting role of JMJD-1 . 2 might indicate that , besides further demethylation of H3K27me2 , perhaps also the removal of H3K9me2 facilitates GeCo . Future studies will shed light on this interesting question . UTX-1 orthologs in other species contribute to tissue-specific chromatin signatures , for example during myogenesis or in cardiac development ( Seenundun et al . , 2010; Lee et al . , 2012 ) , and have been implicated in germ-cell and somatic reprograming ( Mansour et al . , 2012 ) . Together with our data , these findings underscore the importance of UTX-1 in cellular reprograming . Here , we suggest that one way the activity of UTX-1 may be stimulated to promote reprograming is through its Notch signaling-dependent transcriptional activation . Interestingly , an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PRC2 has also been observed in T-cell leukemia ( Ntziachristos et al . , 2012 ) . A fascinating possibility is that a regulatory principle described here could help explain the etiology of this and perhaps other human diseases linked to a pathological increase in Notch signaling .\nStandard procedures were used to maintain animals . Worms ( RRID:WB_DL226 ) were grown at 25°C unless stated otherwise . All heat-shock and temperature-sensitive strains were kept at 15°C . The C . elegans lines used in this study are listed and described in detail in the Supplementary file 3A . The enhancer-suppressor screen on Notch targets was performed by feeding the animals with bacteria containing RNAi clones from the Ahringer and Vidal RNAi libraries . The clones not present in either of these libraries were cloned using primers as described in detail in the Supplementary file 3B . Experiments were performed at 15°C , 20°C or 25°C using bleached embryos or overnight-synchronized L1 animals as stated in Supplementary file 1 . The percentage of adult animals with the germline tumor phenotype was scored . To test germ-cell autonomy , RNAi clones that induced significant suppression or enhancement in either setting were re-tested in a strain carrying the glp-1 ( ar202 ) ( RRID:WB_GC833 ) allele and , additionally the rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) ( RRID:WB_NL2098 ) mutation , which impairs RNAi primarily in the soma ( Sijen et al . , 2001 ) . For this test , gravid adults were picked to RNAi plates and allowed to lay eggs overnight at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C . Progeny was scored for enhancement or suppression of the germline tumorous phenotype at the young adult stage by DAPI staining of dissected gonads and scoring gonads as either wild-type , as containing a proximal or distal tumor but still some eggs , or as completely tumorous . Reprograming experiments were carried out as F1-RNAi . Worms were put on RNAi plates and the following F1 generation was screened for phenotypes . Used RNAi clones are described in the Supplementary file 3B . The genotype of the worms used for germ cell reprograming assays is BAT28 ( otIs305 ntIs1 , RRID:WB_OH9846 , details in Supplemental Materials and methods ) . Animals were synchronized by bleaching and eggs were put on NGM-agar containing E . coli OP50 ( RRID:WB_OP50 ) as a food source to grow at 15°C until worms reached the L4-stage . At this stage 15–20 worms were put per well of a 6-well plate , containing bacteria expressing dsRNA or carrying an empty RNAi vector , and grown at 15°C until most of the F1 progeny reached the L3/L4 stage . The plates were heat-shocked at 37°C for 30 min followed by an overnight incubation at 25°C . Next day ( ~16 hrs post heat-shock ) the plates were screened for progeny showing ectopic GFP induction in the germline . To induce the Glp phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) , the animals were shifted to room temperature 9 hrs before the heat-shock . For double RNAi , bacteria were grown as saturated culture . The OD600 was measured to ensure that the bacteria were mixed in an appropriate 1:1 ratio and subsequently seeded on RNAi 6-well plates . The RNAi screen was performed as described above . The p-values were calculated using Student's t-test . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) treatment was carried out as previously described ( Fox et al . , 2011; Patel et al . , 2012 ) . HU was added to seeded RNAi-plates at a final concentration of 250 µM . L4 worms ( strain BAT32 , details in Supplementary file 3A ) grown on RNAi-plates were transferred to HU plates and incubated at room temperature for 5 hrs prior to heat-shock in order to induce CHE-1 expression . To test HU efficiency , control animals were treated with HU for 12 hrs with subsequent staining for DAPI and H3Ser10ph ( pH3 ) antibody ( Abcam #ab5176 ) . After overnight incubation , the worms were assessed for GFP induction in the germline as described above . To assess the efficiency of the HU treatment , the E . coli strain MG1693 ( E . coli stock center ) , with incorporated 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine ( EdU ) , was used to feed L3/L4 worms . EdU in combination with DAPI staining was performed similar to the procedure described previously ( Ito and McGhee , 1987 ) and according to the manufacturer's instructions ( Invitrogen , Europe ) of the EdU labeling kit . The Click-iT EdU reaction buffer ( Invitrogen , Europe ) was mixed with Alexa Fluor azide ( ‘click’ reaction ) dye to detect cells that were replicating DNA . Staining was performed by freeze cracking worms after fixation with 2% formaldehyde . Parental animals were raised at 15°C and shifted to 25°C for egg laying . Offspring was dissected after the L4-adult transition . Fifty gonads per analyzed genotype in triplicates were dissected in M9 containing levamisole . RNA was isolated using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit ( Applied Biosystems ) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Total RNA ( 200 ng for the Notch ON/OFF experiments or 100 ng for the mes/wild-type experiments ) was amplified using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Amplified Double Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Affymetrix GeneChip WT Double-Stranded cDNA Terminal Labeling Kit was used for the fragmentation and labeling of 7 . 5 μg cDNA . The labeled material was loaded onto Affymetrix GeneChip C . elegans Tiling 1 . 0R Arrays and hybridized at 65ºC for 16 hrs . The arrays were washed in an Affymetrix Fluidics station with the protocol FS450_0001 and scanned in an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 with autoloader using Affymetrix GCC Scan Control v . 3 . 0 . 0 . 1214 software . All tiling arrays were processed in R ( 32 , 33 ) using Bioconductor ( 34 ) and the packages tilingArray and preprocessCore . The arrays were RMA background corrected and log2 transformed on the oligo level using the following command: expr <- log2 ( rma . background . correct ( exprs ( readCel2eSet ( filenames , rotated = TRUE ) ) ) ) . We mapped the oligos from the tiling array ( bpmap file from www . affymetrix . com ) to the C . elegans genome assembly ce6 ( www . genome . ucsc . edu ) using bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) , allowing no error and unique mapping position . Expressions for individual transcripts were calculated by intersecting the genomic positions of the oligos with transcript annotation ( WormBase WS190 ) and averaging the intensity of the respective oligos . For the mes-4/wt experiment , no quantile normalization was performed as the distributions for the mes-4 mutant and the wt differed substantially . In the case of the Notch ON/OFF dataset quantile normalization was performed on the level of transcripts . The p-values were calculated in R with the hypergeometric distribution function 'phyper' . RNA was isolated as described above . cDNA was synthesized with oligo dT primer using the ImProm II Reverse Transcription System from Promega according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was used for qPCR with the Absolute QPCR SYBR Green ROX Mix ( AbGene ) on an ABI PRISM 7700 system ( Applied Biosystems ) . qPCR reactions were performed as described previously ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . At least one primer in each pair is specific for an exon-exon junction . Sequences of the used primers are described in detail in the Supplementary file 3C . Mouse RNA was added before RNA isolation and reverse transcription , allowing for normalization to cyt-c and thereby correcting for variations in RNA isolation and reverse transcription . Standard curves for quantification were generated from a serial dilution of input cDNA for each primer pair . The amount of target present in each replicate was derived from the standard curve; an average was calculated for each of the triplicates . To compare total mRNA levels , the qPCR results were normalized to mouse cyt-c and to the C . elegans tubulin gene tbb-2 , and fold enrichments were calculated . RNA in situ hybridization was performed and analyzed as previously described ( Biedermann et al . , 2009 ) . Description of the primer pairs to generate probes from cDNA can be found in the Supplementary file 3C . Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope , equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRc camera . Images were taken in linear mode of the Axiovision software ( Zeiss ) and processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . ChIP was performed as described ( Askjaer et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , worms ( strains OP591 , RRID:WB_OP591 , and BAT890 ) were washed with M9 buffer and frozen as ‘worm popcorn’ in liquid nitrogen prior to pulverization with a mortar and pestle . The powder was dissolved in 10 volumes of 1 , 1% formaldehyde in PBS + 1 mM PMSF and incubated 10 mins with gentle rocking at room temperature with subsequent quenching for 5 mins at room temperature by adding 2 , 5 molar glycine ( final concentration 125 mM ) . After centrifugation with 4 . 000 g at 4°C the pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS+1 mM PMSF and resuspended in 50 mM FA buffer ( 50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7 , 5; 1 mM EDTA; 1% Triton-X 100; 0 , 1% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl ) + 1% sarkosyl + protease-inhibitors . Samples were sonicated twice using the Biorupter ( 15 times 30 s ON , 30 s OFF ) on high settings at 4°C followed by spinning at 13 . 000 g , 15 min , 4°C . The supernatant corresponding to 4 mg of protein measured by Bradford assay was used for ChIPs . Samples were incubated with 50 µl of FLAG or HA antibodies coupled to µMACS microbeads ( Milteny ) ( all blocked with 5% milk in FA-buffer ) . After incubating 1 hr at 4°C , the beads where washed in µMACS matrix columns in a magnetic rack with FA buffer containing 1 M and 0 . 5 M NaCl and subsequent wash with TE and TEL buffer ( 0 , 25 M LiCl; 1% Sodium deoxycholate; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM Tris pH 8 , 0 ) . Bound material was eluted with 65°C pre-warmed 125 µl ChIP elution buffer ( 1% SDS , 250 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA ) and fixation was reversed using 2 µl of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K at at 50°C for 1 hr followed by 65°C incubation overnight . DNA was purified using the Quiaquick PCR purification kit in a final volume of 40 µl and 1 µl was used for qPCR . Negative controls were used to assess the quality of the ChIP and fold enrichment of the target genes: lysates ( N2 worms ) which do not express the recombinant target protein with specific antibody ( anti-FLAG coupled to µMACS beads ) and lysates of worms expressing the recombinant target protein with unspecific antibody ( anti-HA coupled to µMACS beads ) controls , respectively . Primer for qPCRs was designed using Primer3Plus ( Untergasser et al . , 2007 ) with the following settings: amplified region min . 100 bp – max . 200 bp; GC content: 50–60%; min . primer length: 18 nt – max . length 24 nt; melting temperature: min . 58°C – max . 63°C; max . ; 3' self complementary allowance set to 1; max . allowed length of a mononucleotide repeat ( max . poly-x ) : 3 . Sequences of the used primers are listed in in the Supplementary file 3C . The qPCRs were run on CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System from BioRad using the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix ( 2X ) . The data analysis was performed by calculating the ΔΔCt-values . Differences were assessed using Student's t-test . Worms were transferred to a slide and fixed by adding 10–20 µl 95% ethanol and letting evaporate the ethanol . The ethanol fixation was repeated 2 more times before adding the DAPI solution in microscopy mounting media ( vectashield from Vector or similar ) . The samples were sealed with a coverslip and nail polish before microscopy . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and the SensicamII camera ( PCO ) and the micromanager software was used to capture Z-stack images with 0 . 5 µm slice steps . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times . Counting of germ cells within the range from the DTC to the turn of gonadal arms of glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; hsp::che-1; gcy-5::gfp animals treated with either mock or lin-53 RNAi was performed using the Z-stacks . Micromanager was used to control the Z-stack levels and the ImageJ plugin for cell counting for scoring the number of germ cells . Germ cell counts in gonads of Notch ON: gld-2 ( q497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( ar202 ) and Notch OFF: gld-2 ( a497 ) gld-1 ( q485 ) ; glp-1 ( e2144 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) and germline tumor phenotype in glp-1 ( ar202 ) and glp-1 ( ar202 ) ; rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) were scored after dissection , formaldehyde fixation and DAPI staining . For Notch ON and Notch OFF mutants , the central plane of the gonads was imaged and germ cells in the entire dissected gonad were counted using the CellCounter plugin with ImageJ . For each of the two strains , germ cells in the entire gonad of 15 dissected gonads were counted . Antibody stainings of intact worms were performed using a freeze-crack procedure as described ( Duerr , 2006 ) . In brief , after washing , worms were resuspended in 0 . 025% glutaraldehyde , and frozen between two frost-resistant glass slides on dry ice . Separating the glass slides while frozen creates additional cracks in the cuticle . Acetone/methanol or 4% paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer for 1 hr on ice fixation was used . Worms were washed off the slides in PBS , blocked with 0 . 2% gelatin + 0 . 25% Triton in PBS , and stained . Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS with 0 . 1% gelatin and 0 . 25% Triton and fixed worms were incubated 4 hrs - overnight at 4°C . After PBS washes secondary antibody was applied for 3 hrs . After PBS washes worms were mounted with DAPI-containing mounting medium ( Dianova , #CR-38448 ) on glass slides . The primary antibodies used were anti-H3K27me3 ( 1:400; gift from Dr . Hiroshi Kimura ) ; anti-HA ( 1:100 , Roche #12CA5; acetone fixation ) ; anti-H3Ser10ph ( 1:400 , Abcam , #ab14955; acetone fixation ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor dyes applied at 1:1000 dilution . Stainings for H3K27me3 on dissected gonads were performed using anti-H3K27me3 from Millipore ( catalogue number 07–449 , Lot 1959680; courtesy of Jan Padeken , Gasser laboratory ) on dissected gonads . The adult animals were dissected in M9 containing levamisole , fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS on poly-lysine coated slides , snap-frozen on dry ice , freeze-cracked , incubated for 5 mins in ice-cold DMF at −20° , washed for 5 mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature , blocked for 20 mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 + 5% BSA and incubated with the primary antibody over night at 4°C . Secondary antibodies ( Alexa 488 , goat anti rabbit , 1:500 ) were applied for 2 hrs at room temperature . Slides were then washed three times for 5 mins in PBS 0 . 1% Tween-20 at room temperature and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI . The transcriptional reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 ) was constructed from the 1302 bp putative promoter region of the gene utx-1 ( human UTX ( Ubiquitously transcribed TPR on X ) homolog - 1 ) fused to sequences encoding for GFP-H2B and the ubiquitously expressed tbb-2 3’UTR using the Gateway Reporter Cloning System ( Merritt et al . , 2008 ) . The reporter gene putx-1::gfp-h2b ( rrrSi185 and rrrSi281 ) was constructed with the following primers: putx-attB4: GGGGACAACTTTGTATAGAAAAGTTGGGATTTTATCTTCATCGGACCTG putx-attB1 : GGGGACTGCTTTTTTGTACAAACTTGTGGCGGTGTGAGAAGCGATAC The full-length functional transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-utx-1::utx-1 3’UTR ( rrrSi189 ) was constructed with the following primers: utx-1+3UTR+attB2 L ggggacagctttcttgtacaaagtggACGACGAATCAGAACCTCTGCCGGAGGAGCGTCATgtaag utx-1+3UTR+attB3 R ggggacaactttgtataataaagttgaatgcggatactgccttctc The functional UTX-1 transgene putx-1::flag-gfp-tev::utx-1::utx-1 3’utr ( rrrSi189 ) contains the same promoter as the transcriptional reporter , the full-length utx-1 genomic sequence as well as the endogenous 3’UTR , and was equipped with N-terminal GFP , FLAG , and TEV tags . Transgenic animals were produced as single-copy integrants using the MosSCI direct insertion protocol ( Frøkjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . The rrrSi189 transgene is functional , as it rescues the utx-1 mutant ( ok3553 allele ) . For GFP quantification , gonads were dissected from live animals in M9 buffer containing levamisole and mounted to glass microscopy slides ( Frøkjaer-Jensen et al . , 2008 ) . Fluorescent micrographs were recorded with Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and a Zeiss Axioncam MRm REV 2 CCD camera was used to capture images . Fluorescence intensities were quantified using ImageJ . GFP intensities were normalized to the picture background and corrected with the average autofluorescences measured in wild type ( N2 ) gonads at the corresponding temperatures . Images subject to direct comparison were taken at identical exposure times and were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS4 in an identical manner . The numbers of analyzed gonads were as follows: n = 44 for wild-type reporter; n = 36 for glp-1 ( gf ts ) ; n = 55 for wild-type reporter on control RNAi; n = 48 for mes-2 ( RNAi ) ; n = 15 for mes-3 ( RNAi ) ; n = 29 for mes-6 ( RNAi ) , and n = 20 for LAG-1 binding sites deleted reporter . Alleles used were glp-1 ( ar202 ) and mes-2 ( bn11 ) . Worms were grown at the semi-permissive temperature of 20°C and gonads were dissected and DAPI-stained shortly after the L4-young adult transition . The experiment was performed twice . In a first round , a low number of gonads were examined to identify whether the double mutant had a phenotype and to define phenotypic categories to score . Based on the observation of a clear and penetrant phenotype , gonads were scored in a second round according to the categories defined in the first round .",
         "The DNA in genes encodes the basic information needed to build an organism or control its day-to-day operations . Most cells in an organism contain the same genetic information , but different types of cell use the information differently . For example , many of the genes that are active in a muscle cell are different from those that are active in a skin cell . These different patterns of gene activation largely determine a cell’s identity and are brought about by DNA-binding proteins or chemical modifications to the DNA ( which are both forms of so-called epigenetic regulation ) . Nevertheless , cells occasionally change their identities – a phenomenon that is referred to as reprograming . This process allows tissues to be regenerated after wounding , but , due to technical difficulties , reprograming has been often studied in isolated cells grown in a dish . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . set out to understand how being surrounded by intact tissue influences reprograming . The experiments made use of C . elegans worms , because disturbing how this worm’s DNA is packaged can trigger its cells to undergo reprograming . Seelk , Adrian-Kalchhauser et al . show that a signaling pathway that is found in many different animals enhances this kind of reprograming in C . elegans . On the one hand , these findings help in understanding how epigenetic regulation can be altered by a specific tissue environment . On the other hand , the findings also suggest that abnormal signaling can result in altered epigenetic control of gene expression and lead to cells changing their identity . Indeed , increased signaling is linked to a major epigenetic mechanism seen in specific blood tumors , suggesting that the regulatory principles uncovered using this simple worm model could eventually provide insights into a human disease . A future challenge will be to determine precisely how the studied signaling pathway interacts with the epigenetic regulator that controls reprograming . Understanding this interaction in molecular detail could help to devise strategies for controlling reprograming . These strategies could in turn lead to treatments for people with conditions that cause specific cells types to be lost , such as Alzheimer’s disease or injuries .",

         "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a respiratory , blood , liver , and bladder pathogen of significant clinical concern . We show that the adaptor protein , SKAP2 , is required for protection against K . pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections . Skap2-/- mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells . Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs , and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K . pneumoniae infection in mice; however , K . pneumoniae-stimulated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in vitro was abolished . K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC . The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K . pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways . In conclusion , SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection .\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that can cause a wide range of life-threatening infections , including pneumonia , sepsis and urinary tract infections ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . K . pneumoniae is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections with one recent study reporting that K . pneumoniae contributes to 7 . 7% of cases from over 4500 hospitals ( Weiner et al . , 2016 ) . The increasing number of severe , and sometimes systemic , K . pneumoniae infections are largely attributed to a rise in antibiotic-resistant strains ( Falagas et al . , 2014; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , 2018; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) and hypervirulent strains that generate thicker capsules ( Zhang et al . , 2016; Harada et al . , 2019; Lam et al . , 2018 ) . Highlighting the importance of the innate immune response , neutropenic patients are highly susceptible to life-threatening respiratory and bloodstream infections , including those caused by K . pneumoniae ( Zhu et al . , 2018; Micozzi et al . , 2017 ) . K . pneumoniae lung pathogenesis has been extensively investigated in a mouse model using the rodent-adapted ATCC 43816 ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Bachman et al . , 2015; Vornhagen et al . , 2019; Batra et al . , 2012 ) . In murine models of infection , the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain robustly infects lungs eliciting a strong innate immune response through rapid and concurrent recruitment of neutrophils and iMOs to the infected lungs ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Cai et al . , 2010; Batra et al . , 2012; Sharma et al . , 2014; Ye et al . , 2001 ) . Work using this strain has revealed several genes that protect K . pneumoniae against the host neutrophil response ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Neutrophils are the first responder cell type for fighting against invading pathogens , however , their activation is tightly regulated to prevent severe tissue damage that have been correlated with several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases ( Mócsai , 2013 ) . At the site of infection , neutrophils can bind to pathogens leading to the activation of various killing mechanisms , including phagocytosis , generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , degranulation , and release of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) ( Futosi et al . , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017; Mócsai , 2013 ) . Although the K . pneumoniae capsule decreases bacterial binding and internalization ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , ROS , degranulation , NETs , and cytokine production have all been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae ( Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Chen et al . , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Ivin et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . The importance of ROS in host protection is highlighted in the setting of Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) , a disease characterized by genetic mutations in the NADPH oxidase , where patients are unable to make ROS and are susceptible to Klebsiella infections ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Bortoletto et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , mice with defective ROS production ( Cybb-/- ) have a higher bacterial burden than wild-type mice during K . pneumoniae lung infection ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . Receptor-mediated ROS production in neutrophils is driven by signal-transduction pathways that activate components of the NADPH oxidase complex ( Nguyen et al . , 2017; Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . These signaling pathways are tightly regulated to prevent inappropriate activation and subsequent tissue damage ( Futosi et al . , 2013 ) . Work in mice suggests that signaling through integrin , mincle receptors , G-protein couple receptors ( GPCRs ) and toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) are critical for protection against K . pneumoniae infection ( Teng et al . , 2016; Sharma et al . , 2014; Sharma et al . , 2017; Regueiro et al . , 2006; Galvão et al . , 2018; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . In fact , multiple receptors may sense and/or bind to K . pneumoniae triggering ROS production . Prior studies have indicated a critical role for Src Kinase Associated Phosphoprotein-2 , SKAP2 ( SKAP-Hom and SKAP-55R ) downstream of integrin , and GPCRs in neutrophils and macrophages ( Boras et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Mócsai et al . , 2002; Togni et al . , 2005 ) . SKAP2 , a cytosolic adaptor protein , is required for integrin-mediated ROS production , adhesion , and migration to sterile inflammatory sites through its interaction with mediators of actin rearrangement ( Alenghat et al . , 2012; Boras et al . , 2017; Shimamura et al . , 2013; Tanaka et al . , 2016 ) . SKAP2 is also a target for inactivation by bacterial virulence factors , suggesting that it plays a key role in host defenses against infections ( Black et al . , 2000; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) . In humans , the Skap2 gene has been identified as a risk locus for Type 1 Diabetes , and Crohn’s disease ( Jostins et al . , 2012; Barrett et al . , 2009 ) . In resting cells , SKAP2 is thought to exist in an autoinhibitory conformation as a homodimer that is constitutively bound to PRAM-1 in neutrophils ( Moog-Lutz et al . , 2001; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) , or its homolog , ADAP , in other immune cells ( Liu et al . , 1998; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Black et al . , 2000; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Upon receptor activation , SKAP2 changes to an active conformation that is localized to the plasma membrane , which allows it to interact other effector proteins including Src Family Kinases ( SFKs ) ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Liu et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , activated SKAP proteins can relay information from receptors to focal adhesion kinases ( FAK1/Pyk2 ) to other cytoskeletal mediators ( Ménasché et al . , 2007; Boras et al . , 2017; Tanaka et al . , 2016; Raab et al . , 2017; Ophir et al . , 2013 ) . Using a murine model of K . pneumoniae 43816 infection , we characterized the role of SKAP2 in pulmonary host defense against K . pneumoniae in this study . We demonstrate that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contributed to the pulmonary containment of K . pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes . Using murine neutrophils , we show that K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production requires SKAP2 , SFKs , Syk , PLCγ , Btk , and PKC , and that SKAP2 is required for maximal K . pneumoniae-activated phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinases SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 .\nTo examine the role of SKAP2 in the pathogenesis of pneumonic K . pneumoniae infection , we intranasally infected wild-type ( WT ) BALB/c or BALB/c Skap2-/- mice with a streptomycin-resistant derivative of K . pneumoniae 43816 , a hyper-capsule producer that belongs to one of the most common hypervirulent serotype , K2 ( Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Previous studies using K . pneumoniae 43816 or a derivative of this strain have reported a 50% lethal dose at 48 hr after infection with 3−5 × 103 colony forming units ( cfu ) in BALB/c mice , and a robust infection with high bacterial burden and cellular infiltration in the lungs by 24 hr with mice developing disseminated infection by 48 hr in C57BL/6J ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015; Ye et al . , 2001; Feldman et al . , 2019 ) . WT and Skap2-/- mice were infected with 5 × 103 cfu and were monitored for weight loss , bacterial colonization , and innate cell recruitment at 8 , 16 , and 24 hr post infection ( hpi ) ( Figure 1A–C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , E–J ) . Consistent with prior studies , by 24 hr , infected WT mice lost 2% of their body weight , and K . pneumoniae reached on average 106 cfu with a 5-fold increase in neutrophil presence in the infected lungs ( Figure 1A–C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . However , Skap2-/- mice lost significantly more body weight than the WT cohort at 24 hpi ( Figure 1A ) and had significantly higher bacterial loads in their lungs at 16 and 24 hpi ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that Skap2-/- mice are less competent at controlling K . pneumoniae infection . The increase in bacterial burden did not appear to be due to differences in the numbers of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6Ghi ) because neutrophils were detected at comparable levels in WT and Skap2-/- lungs , bone marrow as well as bronchoalveolar lavage of infected mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D ) . In addition , there was no difference in alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) , or dendritic cells ( CD11bhi CD11chi ) in the lungs of K . pneumoniae-infected WT and Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–J ) . Histological examination showed extensive leukocyte infiltration in both the WT and Skap2-/- infected lungs supporting the flow cytometry data ( Figure 1D–L , black arrows ) . This interstitial infiltration inflammatory cells can be seen in the early stages of infection prior to bronchopneumonia ( Lawlor et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , some infected Skap2-/- lungs ( 2/5 lungs ) had lesions with cellular destruction and uncontrolled bacterial growth surrounded by sparse leukocyte infiltration ( Figure 1K–L , blue arrows ) . To evaluate whether SKAP2-dependent control of K . pneumoniae colonization was required in a different mouse background , C57BL/6J , C57BL/6J Skap2-/- , or heterozygous littermates were inoculated retropharyngeally with K . pneumoniae ( Figure 1M–N; Figure 1—figure supplement 1K–N ) . At 24 hpi , C57BL/6 Skap2-/- mice had a significant increase in bacterial burden compared to C57BL/6 and heterozygous littermates ( Figure 1M ) . In general , comparable numbers of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes were detected in all three strains ( Figure 1N; Figure 1—figure supplement 1L–N ) although the percent of neutrophils recovered in C57Bl/6 Skap2-/- mice was higher ( Figure 1N ) In summary , although leukocytes are present in the Skap2-/- lungs at comparable or slightly higher level to wild-type lungs , Skap2-/- mice were more susceptible to K . pneumoniae infection suggesting that their antimicrobial functions are compromised . To investigate whether Skap2 expression in bone marrow-derived leukocytes was required for controlling the antibacterial response to K . pneumoniae infection , we generated bone marrow ( BM ) chimeric mice by transplanting WT or Skap2-/- BM cells into either WT or Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 2A ) . Transplantation efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . WT recipient mice reconstituted with Skap2-/- BM had significantly more K . pneumoniae in contrast to WT mice transplanted with WT BM ( Figure 2B ) . Conversely , Skap2-/- recipients with WT BM cells had significantly decreased K . pneumoniae in their lungs as compared to Skap2-/- hosts that received Skap2-/- BM cells ( Figure 2B ) . The differences in bacterial burdens were not due to differences in numbers of neutrophils as equivalent numbers were recovered among all four groups of mice ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–E ) . While fewer inflammatory monocytes ( iMOs ) were detected in Skap2-/- recipients regardless of BM cell donor , the difference did not correlate with bacterial load ( Figure 2B , D; Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–H ) . Combined , these data indicate Skap2 expression in BM-derived immune cells is required to contain K . pneumoniae growth during lung infection , and that Skap2 expression in cells that are not derived from the marrow do not contribute to this phenotype . The contribution of neutrophils and iMOs to host defense against K . pneumoniae infection is dependent on the bacterial strain used with K . pneumoniae ATCC 43816 being more susceptible to neutrophils ( Xiong et al . , 2015; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . To determine the role of neutrophils and iMOs in the increased susceptibility of Skap2-/- mice to K . pneumoniae , WT and Skap2-/- mice were treated with the α-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) to deplete neutrophils , or the MC-21 antibody , which targets CCR2+ cells to deplete iMOs ( Figure 2E ) . Depletion efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–F ) . While the K . pneumoniae burden in iMOs-depleted WT mice was similar to vehicle-treated mice , significantly more bacteria were recovered from the lungs of neutrophil-depleted WT mice ( Figure 2E ) confirming the importance of neutrophils in host defense ( Ye et al . , 2001; Xiong et al . , 2015 ) . The neutrophil-depleted WT mice had similarly high bacterial burdens as Skap2-/- mice ( Figure 2E ) , and the depletion of Skap2-/- mice of neutrophils or iMOs did not increase their bacterial burden suggesting that protection against K . pneumoniae infection is SKAP2-dependent ( Figure 2E ) . To assess the contribution of Skap2 expression in BM-derived iMOs and neutrophils in limiting K . pneumoniae infection , iMOs and neutrophils were depleted from irradiated Skap2-/- mice that had been reconstituted with WT BM cells ( Figure 2F ) . Depletion efficiency was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2G–J ) . As expected , reconstitution of Skap2-/- mice with WT BM resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial burden compared to Skap2-/- mice that received Skap2-/- BM cells ( Figure 2F ) . Skap2-/- mice that received WT BM and were then depleted of neutrophils with α-Ly6G showed an increase in bacterial load and that burden was similar to those in Skap2-/- mice that received Skap2-/- neutrophils ( Figure 2F ) . By contrast , α-CCR2-treated mice had a similar bacterial burden as PBS-treated mice ( Figure 2F ) . Together , these data indicate that neutrophils cannot control K . pneumoniae 43816 infection in the absence of SKAP2 in the hematopoietic compartment . As Skap2-/- neutrophils are present in infected tissues ( Figure 1D , J , N; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D ) , the uncontrolled K . pneumoniae growth may occur because of defects in the antimicrobial functions of Skap2-/- neutrophils at the site of infection . Neutrophils have multiple antimicrobial mechanisms to limit bacterial growth during infection ( Futosi et al . , 2013; Mócsai , 2013 ) . To investigate which antimicrobial functions are controlled by SKAP2 , the ER-Hoxb8 conditionally-immortalized stem cell system was adopted as a tool to produce a supply of neutrophils ( Wang et al . , 2006; Chu et al . , 2019 ) . Mouse BM-derived stem cells from WT and Skap2-/- mice were retrovirally transduced with Hoxb8 regulated by estrogen ( ER-Hoxb8 ) , and maintained in media containing estrogen ( E2 ) and stem cell factor ( SCF ) to expand granulocyte-monocyte progenitors ( GMP ) in vitro ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–I and see Materials and Methods ) . Removal of E2 inactivates Hoxb8 expression and the addition of interleukin-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor led to terminal neutrophil differentiation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–I ) . Neutrophil maturation from WT and Skap2-/- ER-HoxB8-immortalized GMP cells ( Hoxb8 GMP ) was evaluated by nuclear morphology ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) and cell surface expression of cKit , CD11b and Ly6G ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D , G–I ) . Hoxb8 GMP cells were mononuclear and cKit+ CD11b- Ly6G- ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D , G–I ) . Cells from both mouse lines differentiated by day 4 and were comparably viable ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F ) . Fully differentiated cells are referred to as differentiated in vitro ( DIV ) neutrophils . Like BM-derived neutrophils , DIV neutrophils expressed polymorphonuclear morphology and are cKit- CD11b+ Ly6G+ ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D , G–I ) . To confirm the functionality of DIV neutrophils in comparison to BM neutrophils , their ability to generate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) following integrin and Fcγ receptor stimulation was assessed ( Chu et al . , 2019 ) . When plated onto surfaces coated with poly-RGD , an engineered polypeptide containing multiple copies of the integrin binding motif , WT BM and DIV neutrophils released superoxide , while Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils did not ( Figure 3A–C ) . This is consistent with previously published data in C57BL/6J and Skap2-/- BM neutrophils ( Boras et al . , 2017 ) . The loss in integrin-mediated ROS production was not due to defects in the NADPH oxidase itself , as Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils robustly released ROS when stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) , which bypasses receptor-mediated signaling pathways and activates NADPH oxidase via protein kinase C ( PKC ) ( Dang et al . , 2001; Figure 3C ) . By contrast , after stimulation of Fcγ receptors by IgG immune complexes ( IC ) , WT and Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils robustly produced ROS ( Figure 3D–F ) . Skap2-/- BM and DIV neutrophils consistently released 60–80% as much ROS as compared to levels seen in comparable WT neutrophils . This indicates IC-stimulated ROS is partially dependent on SKAP2 . Differences in ROS production were not due to differences in surface marker expression levels as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils expressed similar levels of integrin and Fcγ receptors as measured by CD11b and CD16 expression , respectively , by flow cytometry ( Figure 3G–J ) . Combined , these results indicate WT and Skap2-/- DIVs phenocopy primary BM neutrophils both morphologically and functionally and are a useful tool to investigate how SKAP2 modulates K . pneumoniae-induced neutrophil responses . Furthermore , these data suggest that a functional NADPH complex can assemble in Skap2-/- neutrophils and that SKAP2 is required for receptor-activated signaling pathways downstream of integrin receptors , but not Fcγ receptors . Multiple neutrophil antimicrobial mechanisms , including degranulation , phagocytosis , and NETs , have been implicated in host defense against K . pneumoniae infection ( Chen et al . , 2016; Ivin et al . , 2017; Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019; Paczosa and Mecsas , 2016; Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015; Kobayashi et al . , 2016 ) . To examine whether Skap2-/- neutrophils degranulated as efficiently as WT neutrophils during K . pneumoniae infection , we measured levels of released MMP-9 and neutrophil elastase ( ELA2 ) , proteins found in tertiary and primary granules , respectively ( Papayannopoulos et al . , 2010; Sheshachalam et al . , 2014 ) . Supernatants from WT and Skap2-/- K . pneumoniae-infected lungs had equivalent levels of MMP-9 and ELA2 in Skap2-/- at 16 and 24 hpi as detected by ELISA ( Figure 4A–B ) . This suggests that the increased in susceptibility of Skap2-/- mice was not due to defects in degranulation . To determine the role of SKAP2 in phagocytosis of K . pneumoniae , phagocytosis was initially measured using microscopy . However , microscopic examination of WT DIV neutrophils infected with GFP-labeled K . pneumoniae and counterstained with Alexa594-conjugated polyvalent α-K . pneumoniae for extracellular bacteria did not reveal any internalized bacteria indicating that phagocytosis levels were less than 1% ( unpublished data ) . Using a more sensitive gentamicin protection assay ( Walker et al . , 2019 ) , K . pneumoniae 43816 was recovered on average at less than 0 . 01% in WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils , while a non-encapsulated ( ΔcpsB ) K . pneumoniae strain was recovered at approximately 0 . 05% ( Figure 4C ) . This low level was not due to a defect in phagocytosis of DIV neutrophils as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils were able to phagocytose Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII ΔyscNU strain , a strain that is susceptible to phagocytosis ( Balada-Llasat and Mecsas , 2006 ) . WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils phagocytosed 20% and 10% of ΔyscNU , respectively ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting that phagocytosis of this Y . pseudotuberculosis strain is partially dependent on SKAP2 . Although we observed low level of phagocytosis of K . pneumoniae 43816 , the SKAP2-mediated defect in phagocytosis might be more prominent when challenged with other K . pneumoniae isolates . Combined , these results indicate that the K . pneumoniae 43816 strain is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression , but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection . ROS is an important mechanism for protection against K . pneumoniae as mice that lack the essential gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase , Cybb-/- , were significantly more susceptible to K . pneumoniae infection and had a significant increase in bacterial burden in their lungs ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . To test whether SKAP2 deficiency resulted in a defect in neutrophil ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection , an isoluminol-amplified chemiluminiscence assay was used . In contrast to WT BM and DIV neutrophils , neither Skap2-/- BM nor DIV neutrophils produced ROS following exposure to K . pneumoniae ( Figure 5A–B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C ) . The loss of K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production was not due to a defect in bacterial-binding as WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils bound GFP-labeled K . pneumoniae equivalently when assessed by flow cytometry following both 15- and 30 min incubations ( Figure 5C ) . Without treating the cells with actin inhibitor , such as cytochalasin B , bound and phagocytosed bacteria could contribute to the levels of GFP+ cells . However , the less than 1% of internalization of K . pneumoniae observed in the gentamicin protection assay ( Figure 4C ) suggests that the majority of the bacteria are extracellular , and that GFP+ cells are more likely reflective of binding . Finally , SKAP2 was important for ROS production after infection with another gram-negative bacterial strain , a type 3 deficient Y . pseudotuberculosis strain , ΔyscF ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ) . In summary , Skap2-/- neutrophils are defective in triggering the signaling cascade ( s ) required for ROS after K . pneumoniae binding to surface receptors . To investigate how SKAP2 mediates K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production , we first evaluated the requirement for several well-established proteins that are critical for receptor-mediated ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection . Src family kinases ( SFKs ) , Spleen Associated Tyrosine Kinase ( Syk ) , Bruton’s tyrosine kinase ( Btk ) , Phospholipase Cγ2 ( PLCγ2 ) , and PKC play critical roles in receptor-mediated ROS production ( Löfgren et al . , 1999; Braselmann et al . , 2006; Volmering et al . , 2016; Dang et al . , 2001; Raad et al . , 2009; Kovács et al . , 2014; Fumagalli et al . , 2007; Graham et al . , 2007; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) . To determine whether these proteins are required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , WT DIV neutrophils were pretreated with PP2 , R406 , Ibrutinib , U-73122 , and Go6983 , which are small molecules that inhibit the functions of SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC ( both novel and conventional isoforms ) , respectively ( Figure 5D; Peterman et al . , 2004; Braselmann et al . , 2006; Rolán et al . , 2013; Prezzo et al . , 2019; Fumagalli et al . , 2007 ) . The DIV neutrophils were then infected with K . pneumoniae . Pretreatment with PP2 , R406 , Ibrutinib , U-73122 , and Go6983 abolished ROS production after K . pneumoniae infection compared to vehicle-pretreated neutrophils ( Figure 5E ) . As expected , only pretreatment with Go6983 blocked ROS after PMA exposure . U73433 , an U73122 analog that does not target PLCγ , did not block K . pneumoniae- and PMA-induced ROS ( Figure 5E; Rolán et al . , 2013 ) . This suggests SFKs , Syk , Btk , PLCγ2 , and PKC are each necessary for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS production . Next , we assessed whether SKAP2 mediates K . pneumoniae-induced ROS production by influencing tyrosine phosphorylated-dependent functions of SFKs and Syk . To determine whether SFKs and Syk are phosphorylated in response to K . pneumoniae infection , western blots of lysates from K . pneumoniae-infected WT DIV neutrophils were probed with phospho-specific antibodies . Infection with K . pneumoniae induced phosphorylation of SFKs ( pSFK ) and Syk ( pSFK ) to levels 2–5-fold higher than in unstimulated neutrophils ( Figure 5F–I; Supplementary file 1 ) . These results support findings with inhibitors showing that SFKs and Syk functions are required for K . pneumoniae-activated ROS ( Figure 5E ) . In addition , proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 ( Pyk2 ) , which is a tyrosine kinase that functions downstream of SFKs and Syk to mediate ROS production ( Kamen et al . , 2011; Zhao and Bokoch , 2005 ) , was phosphorylated in response to K . pneumoniae stimulation ( Figure 5K–L; Supplementary file 1 ) . Thus , signaling circuit ( s ) containing SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 were activated in neutrophils following receptor binding of K . pneumoniae . To determine if SKAP2 is required for phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases , the levels of pSFKs , pSyk , and pPyk2 were assessed in Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils following K . pneumoniae exposure . While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 phosphorylation were all slightly induced in Skap2-/- neutrophils , the level of induction was often significantly reduced as compared to WT neutrophils ( Figure 5F–L; Supplementary file 1 ) . To determine if the reduction in phosphorylation was due to decreased cell viability , Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils were also stimulated with IC as a control . Stimulation of FcγRs resulted in the phosphorylation for SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 to similar levels in both WT and Skap2-/- DIV neutrophils ( Figure 5F , H , K and Supplementary file 1 ) . Collectively , these results show that SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 are required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , and that the loss of SKAP2 prevents full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 after K . pneumoniae stimulation such that neutrophils are unable to generate ROS production .\nOur experiments reveal that SKAP2 plays a key role in host defense in the hematopoietic compartment against K . pneumoniae 43816 in pulmonary infections in a murine lung model of infection . SKAP2 was indispensable for K . pneumoniae-stimulated neutrophil ROS production , but not degranulation or phagocytosis , suggesting that the increased bacterial burden in the Skap2-/- mice is affected by the loss of ROS . Sensitivity of K . pneumoniae to ROS is strongly supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice during lung infection , and observations in CGD patients ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . In murine neutrophils , SKAP2 was required for full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 , demonstrating a critical role in K . pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways that are required for ROS production . Consistent with previous findings ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , K . pneumoniae 43816 was resistant to internalization indicating that phagocytosis is most likely not the primary protective mechanism provided by neutrophils to this strain . Prior studies , including one using K . pneumoniae 43816 , have shown that degranulation of myeloperoxidase , ELA2 , and cathepsin G are important for reducing bacterial burden of K . pneumoniae in mice ( Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . However , we found that despite equivalent levels of ELA2 , degranulation in Skap2-/- mice was not sufficient to control K . pneumoniae burden in the absence of ROS , indicating that neutrophil ROS and degranulation may cooperate in containing K . pneumoniae infection . Since degranulation occurred normally in Skap2-/- lungs , the pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling pathways regulating degranulation in murine neutrophils after K . pneumoniae infection . Neutrophils and ROS contribute to the defense against other pathogens such as Y . pseudotuberculosis , Staphylococcus aureus , Candida albicans , among others ( Green et al . , 2016; Mócsai , 2013; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) . The immunological mechanisms of SKAP2-mediated neutrophil responses to other pathogens are under investigation . We propose the following model for SKAP2-dependent neutrophilic response to K . pneumoniae in mice based our findings and work of others ( Figure 6; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Togni et al . , 2005; Timms et al . , 1999 ) . Following K . pneumoniae infection , activation of receptors , like GPCRs recognizing N-formylated bacterial proteins or mincle recognizing bacterial lectins , leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) and the generation of phosphatidylinositol [3 , 4 , 5]-triphosphate ( PIP3 ) , resulting in PIP3-mediated SKAP2 activation and membrane localization ( Figure 6A–B; Futosi et al . , 2013; Swanson et al . , 2008; Sharma et al . , 2014; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . The activated ( open ) phosphorylated SKAP2 complex can then bind to and enhance phosphorylation of SFKs shifting their active/inactive equilibrium to more active forms and leading to Syk activation ( Figure 6B; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Bureau et al . , 2018; Kouroku et al . , 1998; Lowell , 2011 ) . This is supported by previous biochemical and pull-down studies showing that SKAP2 can directly interact with SFKs ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Liu et al . , 1998; Wang and Rudd , 2008 ) . SFKs and Syk may directly associate with and activate Pyk2 , as observed in response to GPCRs , integrin , TNFα , and/or Salmonella stimulation ( Dikic et al . , 1996; Evangelista et al . , 2007; Han et al . , 2003; Mócsai et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , SKAP2 may interact with Pyk2 signaling complex directly or indirectly through their association with Sirpα ( Raab et al . , 2017; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . Any of these mechanisms would promote stabilization and propagation of SFKs/Syk/Pyk2 phosphorylation in activated murine neutrophil leading to ROS . While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 have been shown to be important for degranulation in murine and human neutrophils ( Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Kamen et al . , 2011; Mócsai et al . , 1999; Han et al . , 2003 ) , we observed degranulation in murine lungs and low levels of phosphorylation after K . pneumoniae infection in murine neutrophils in vitro . These low levels may be sufficient to induced degranulation through a SKAP2-independent signaling pathway . Alternatively , specific phosphorylation sites of SFKs or Syk not tested here may still occurred in the absence of SKAP2 and be sufficient to induce degranulation ( Carsetti et al . , 2009; Tsang et al . , 2008; Moroco et al . , 2014; Mócsai et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , different domains of Pyk2 regulate ROS and degranulation ( Han et al . , 2003 ) . Specifically , the inhibition of the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in human neutrophils leads to a reduction in ROS production in response to TNF , Salmonella , and Listeria , but did not impair neutrophil degranulation and bacterial killing ( Han et al . , 2003 ) . SKAP2 may impact the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in murine neutrophils , but not activation of other domains . Skap2-/- mice have normal levels of circulating neutrophils and Skap2-/- neutrophils were present in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs at a similar , and sometimes higher , levels as WT neutrophils ( Figure 1C–D; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) and ( Togni et al . , 2005 ) . However , prior studies revealed that Skap2-/- myeloid cells , including neutrophils , have impaired recruitment and migration into tissues during sterile inflammation ( Tanaka et al . , 2016; Boras et al . , 2017 ) . This suggests that migration to sterile , but not infectious sites , may require SKAP2 , which is consistent with findings with Syk . Syk is required for neutrophil migration in an inflammatory model but not during bacterial infection ( Zarbock et al . , 2007; Frommhold et al . , 2007; Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Schymeinsky et al . , 2006 ) . Alternatively , it is possible that Skap2-/- neutrophils may have a reduced migration level in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs but this is balanced by significantly higher rate of neutrophil survival and these two factors result in a net neutrophil level that is equivalent to or higher than that observed in WT mice . This result could arise because ROS production can increase myeloid cell death ( Coxon et al . , 1996; Geering and Simon , 2011; Geering et al . , 2011 ) , and thus , defects in ROS production by Skap2-/- neutrophils could contribute to higher survival and accumulation in infected murine lungs . These possibilities are important to address with additional experiments , such as pulse-labelling newly differentiated neutrophils to track rates of migration during infection in vivo . Murine models of infection have been helpful in illuminating K . pneumoniae infection biology , however , there exist significant differences between mice and humans in the immune response to infection , including disparities in structural anatomy , circulating neutrophil counts , surface receptors , and signaling cascades , among others ( Mizgerd and Skerrett , 2008; Mestas and Hughes , 2004; Condliffe et al . , 2005; Hajjar et al . , 2010; Sun et al . , 2016; Bagaitkar et al . , 2012; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) . Thus , to date it is unknown if SKAP2 plays a role in mediating the human neutrophil response to K . pneumoniae infection . Skap2 has 9 transcripts and at least 50 exonic variants that have been reported in the human population , however , their functional consequences , if any , remains unclear ( Cunningham et al . , 2019 ) . It would be interesting to explore if the SKAP2-mediated K . pneumoniae-stimulated responses occur in human neutrophils , and whether neutrophils ( or other cell types ) from individuals carrying specific Skap2 variants respond differently K . pneumoniae 43816 infection . In addition , it is unclear whether our results with K . pneumoniae 43816 will be found with other K2 strains or strains of other serotypes . Genome-wide analyses of K . pneumoniae clinical isolates have shown extensive genetic diversity , virulence factors , and pathogenicity ( Holt et al . , 2015; Deleo et al . , 2014; Agard et al . , 2019 ) . Furthermore , since neutrophils are not the major player in host defenses against all strains of K . pneumoniae , including some multi-drug resistant clinical isolates ( Xiong et al . , 2016; Xiong et al . , 2015; Broug-Holub et al . , 1997; Greenberger et al . , 1996 ) , future studies can use these K . pneumoniae strains to probe the role of SKAP2 in neutrophils as well as other hematopoietic cells during K . pneumoniae infections . In summary , neutrophils and their production of ROS play a dual role in host health in many disease states from acute infections to autoimmune diseases to cancer ( Hoffmann and Griffiths , 2018; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) , and the crucial function of SKAP2-mediated ROS in murine neutrophils suggests that further analysis of the role of SKAP2 in human health warrants investigation .\nBALB/c and C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Taconic Biosciences and Jackson laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) , respectively . Mating pairs of Cybb-/- in C57BL/6J background , and Skap2+/- ( B6 . 129S5-Skap2Gt ( VICTR20 ) 21Lex/Mmjax ) were purchased from Jackson laboratory and bred at Tufts University in the specific pathogen-free facility of Tufts University . Generation of Skap2-/- mice in the BALB/c background was previously described ( Togni et al . , 2005; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . Skap2-/- mice were genotyped by two independent PCRs using primer sequences: SkapLeft-forward primer ( common for both PCRs ) , 5’ CAG CTT GCC GAC TTT TCT; GTLexVir , 5’GAG GGC TGG ACC GCA TCT GG; GTSkapRight , 5’CCG CCT CCC ACC CCT CAA TC following procedures described from Jackson laboratory and ( Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) . All mice were handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tufts University . Mouse infections were carried out as previously described ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) with the following modifications . MKP220 , streptomycin-resistant derivative of K . pneumoniae ATCC43816 strain was used for all infections ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) . Isoflurane anesthetized mice on a BALB/c background were intranasally infected dropwise with 5 × 103 cfu K . pneumoniae in 40 μl of sterile PBS , or with PBS ( Fisher Scientific ) alone . C57BL/6J mice were inoculated retropharyngeally with 5 × 103 cfu as previously described ( Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) . This change in infection route was because we have found that if delivered intranasally , C57BL/6J mice will rapidly dispel the inoculum through their nose and mouth resulting in inconsistent infection . Mice were euthanized using CO2 asphyxiation at the indicated time points after infection . Lungs were collected into sterile PBS , weighed , and aseptically homogenized by pushing the tissue through a 70 μM cell strainer . For bacterial burden analyses , serially diluted homogenates were plated on L-agar and incubated at 37°C overnight to determine CFU/g lung . For depletion of neutrophils or iMOs , mice were intraperitoneally injecting 100 μl of 50 μg/ml α-Ly6G antibody ( clone: 1A8 , Fisher Scientific ) , or 100 μl of 200 μg/ml α-MC21 antibody 16 hr pre-infection . Depletion efficiency was measured by flow cytometry as described below . Collection of bronchoalveolar lavage was conducted as previously described ( Silver et al . , 2019 ) . 4–5 week-old BALB/c and Skap2-/- mice received 100 mg/kg/24 hr SulfaTrim available ad libitum in drinking water for a week prior to and a week following whole body irradiation . Mice were lethally irradiated with 2 doses of 4 . 5 Gγ with a 3–4 hr interval between doses . The next day , each mouse intravenously received 100 μl of sterile PBS containing 5 × 106 BM cells from either BALB/c or Skap2-/- donor mice ( 7–15 week-old ) and were infected with K . pneumoniae 4–5 weeks later . For histological studies , lungs from mock or K . pneumoniae-infected mice were perfused through a tracheal incision using 4% formaldehyde ( MP Biomedicals ) , removed , and incubated in fresh 4% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature ( RT ) . Excess fatty tissues were removed , and lungs were placed in histology cassettes for processing by the Tufts Animal Pathology Core . Tissues were embedded in paraffin and 7 μM thick sections were sliced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) . Sections were blindly scored for number of areas of leukocyte infiltration and detectable bacteria by 4–7 individuals with at least 3 lung sections per mouse using light microscopy . Three PBS-inoculated and 5 K . pneumoniae-infected mice were scored per genotype . Tissues were imaged using an Echo Revolve R4 microscope in the upright brightfield configuration at 4x ( NA 0 . 13 ) or 40x ( NA 0 . 75 ) magnification and acquired at RT using a 12 MP CMOS color camera and the Echo Revolve built-in software . After passage of lung tissues through 70 μm strainers , the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 13 , 000 x g for 10 min at 4°C . Supernatants were then transferred into new Eppendorf tubes for measurement of release of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP-9 ) , and neutrophil elastase ( ELA-2 ) by DuoSet ELISA kits ( R and D Systems ) per manufacturer’s protocols . After passage of lung tissues through a 70 μm strainer , cell suspensions were treated with 1 mg/ml Collagenase D ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 1 hr at 37°C , and then with 1X Pharm Lyse ( Fisher Scientific ) for 5 min at 4°C . Cells were resuspended in ice-cold fluorescence-activated cell sorter ( FACS ) buffer ( PBS containing 1% FBS ) , and blocked with rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 ( Mouse BD Fc Block BD Biosciences ) for 10 min at 4°C . For time courses , cells were stained with α-CD11b-PE ( BioLegend ) , α-Ly6G PE-Cy7 ( BioLegend ) , α-CD11c-PerCP-Cy5 . 5 ( BD Biosciences ) , and α-Gr1-FITC ( BioLegend ) for analysis of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6G+ ) , alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) , and dendritic cells ( CD11bhi CD11chi ) . For bone marrow chimeric and depletion experiments , lung cells were stained with α-CD11b-PacBlue ( BioLegend ) , α-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 ( BioLegend ) , α-Gr1-APC ( BioLegend ) , and α-Ly6C-AlexaFluor647 ( BioLegend ) for analysis of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes as indicated in figure legends . For some experiments , cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 1% saponin , and intracellularly stained with α-SKAP2 ( Proteintech ) or rabbit IgG polyclonal isotype antibody ( Proteintech ) , followed by goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488 secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Data were collected by a BD LSRII , and analyzed with FlowJo ( version 10 . 1 ) . Mouse BM neutrophils were isolated as previously described ( Rolán et al . , 2013 ) with the following modifications . Neutrophils were isolated using a three step Percoll density gradient ( 55% , 65% , and 75% ) , and centrifuged at 480 x g for 30 min at 26°C without applying the break . Neutrophils were collected at the 65–75% interface , resuspended in HBSS without Ca2+ or Mg2+ ( HBSS- ) , then centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min at RT to wash and pellet the cells . Supernatants were removed and cells were resuspended in HBSS- and centrifuged for a total of three washes . Neutrophils were rested at RT for one hour , resuspended in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ( HBSS+ ) to the desired concentration , incubated at RT for 20 min , and then shifted to 37°C for 10 min prior to the experiment . The purity of neutrophil preparations was verified by staining an aliquot of the cells with α-CD11b-PacBlu , α-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 , and α-Gr1-APC and analyzed by flow cytometry . Immortalization of murine BM cells with ER-HoxB8 was done as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2006 ) with the following modifications . Bone marrow stem cells were collected from the tibias and femurs of mice and passed through a 40 μm filter . Cells were layered over Ficoll-Paque-Plus ( Pharmacia ) , and centrifuged at 400 x g for 25 min at RT without applying the break to enrich for mononuclear cells . These cells were incubated in a 6-well tissue culture plate ( Greiner Bio-One ) for 24 hr at 37°C with 5% CO2 prior to the retroviral transduction in complete RPMI , cRPMI ( RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 100U penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) , supplemented with 10 ng/ml stem cell factor ( SCF ) , 10 ng/ml interleukin-3 ( IL-3 ) , and 10 ng/ml interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . The next day , non-adherent cells were harvested and 5 × 105 cells in 500 μl of cRPMI were plated onto a 12-well tissue culture plate ( Corning ) coated with 10 μg/ml human fibronectin ( Sigma ) . Retroviral supernatant ( MSCVneo-HA-ER-Hoxb8 ) was applied in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene and the plates were centrifuged for ‘spinoculation’ at 1000 x g for 90 min at RT . Following spin infection , cells were maintained in cRPMI supplemented with 0 . 5 μM beta-estradiol ( Sigma , E2 ) and conditioned media containing approximately 50 ng/ml SCF ( SCF + E2 cRPMI ) . Cells were maintained for 3–4 weeks to select for ER-HoxB8-carrying granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells . Uninfected cells were maintained alongside as controls and all died by 4 weeks . To confirm the identify of cell lines , we assessed for SKAP2 protein expression by intracellular staining or western blotting . Mycoplasma testing of cultured lines was conducted at 3–6 month intervals using e-Myco Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit ( Bulldog Bio ) . ER-HoxB8 stem cell lines were grown in E2 + SCF cRPMI . Differentiation into neutrophils was done as previously described ( Wang et al . , 2006; Pelletier et al . , 2017 ) with the following modifications . Aliquots of ER-HoxB8 progenitors were washed 3 times in PBS and cultured in E2-free cRPMI media supplemented with ~50 ng/ml SCF , IL-3 , and GCSF for two days . Cells were then restimulated with 50 ng/ml GCSF for another 48 hr . At this point , cells were differentiated and termed DIV neutrophils . DIV neutrophils were collected , pelleted at 250 x g for 5 min at 4°C , re-suspended in HBSS- and rested for 1 hr at RT . DIV neutrophils were re-suspended in HBSS+ to the desired concentration , incubated at RT for 20 min , and then shifted to 37°C for 10 min for functional assays . DAPI staining and flow cytometry were performed to confirm that >90% of cells were neutrophils . An aliquot of 1 × 105 BM and DIV neutrophils were spun onto microscope slide using Shannon Cytospin 3 , fixed with 4% formaldehyde , stained with DAPI ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Cell morphology was imaged at 60X by an Echo Revolve R4 microscope in the upright fluorescent configuration . Aliquots of cells were resuspended in cold FACS buffer and blocked with Mouse BD Fc Block ( BioLegend ) for 10 min at 4°C . Cells were then stained with α-CD11b-PacBlu , α-Ly6G-PE-Cy7 , and α-cKit-PE , and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde prior to analysis . Viability was assessed using trypan blue ( Gibco ) exclusion test immediately prior to functional studies to confirm that >85% of cells were live and all counts were based on live cells . In addition , an ATP-based assay , Promega CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell viability Assay , was conducted during the time course of several experiments to assess viability per instructor’s instructions ( Promega ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-F ) . Neutrophils ( 1 × 105 cells/well ) and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) -labeled K . pneumoniae ( MOI 40 ) were added to non-tissue-treated 96-well plates ( CellTreat ) , centrifuged at 250 x g for 3 min , and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 15 or 30 min . Cells were then harvested , centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min , and resuspended in 200 ul/well ice-cold FACS buffer; this was repeated for a total of 3 washes . Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde , and nuclei were stained with DAPI . The percentage of K . pneumoniae-associated neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry using uninfected neutrophils as control . K . pneumoniae MKP220 and a isogenic non-encapsulated ΔcpsB strain ( Paczosa et al . , 2020; Silver et al . , 2019 ) were grown overnight in LB media at 37°C with aeration , and the next day diluted 1:40 into fresh LB media and grown for an additional 2 hr at 37°C with aeration . The Y . pseudotuberculosis YPIII ΔyscNU strain ( Balada-Llasat and Mecsas , 2006 ) was grown in 2XYT at 26°C with aeration . K . pneumoniae and Y . pseudotuberculosis were then used to infect 1 × 105 DIV neutrophils at an MOI of 10 for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 in 96-well 4HBX plates pre-coated with 10% FBS , and then 100 μg/ml gentamicin was added to wells for 1 hr at 37°C to kill extracellular bacteria . Control FBS-coated wells contained bacteria but no neutrophils and were not treated with gentamicin ( non-gentamicin-treated wells ) . All following steps were conducted at 4°C . Cold PBS was added to the wells; plates were centrifuged at 250 x g for 5 min , and all media were gently removed; this was repeated for a total of four washes . All wells were treated with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 10 min at 4°C , and then serially diluted and plated to quantify surviving bacteria . The percent of phagocytosis was calculated as ( # of bacteria with neutrophils from gentamicin-treated wells ) / ( # of bacteria from non-gentamicin-treated wells ) . High-bound tissue-treated 4HBX 96-well plates ( Fisher Scientific ) were used for all ROS assays . Plates were prepared as follows . For integrin activation , wells were coated with 15 μg/ml poly-RGD ( Sigma ) for 2 hr at 37°C or overnight at RT . For Fcγ receptor activation by IgG immune complexes ( IC ) , wells were coated with 20 μg/ml human serum albumin ( Sigma ) for 1 hr , washed twice with PBS , blocked with 10% FBS for 30 min , washed twice with PBS , and incubated with anti-human serum albumin ( Sigma ) at 1:400 dilution in 10% FBS for 1 hr at 37°C . Control wells were coated with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37°C . All wells were washed twice with PBS prior to use . For experiments with K . pneumoniae , wells were coated with 10% FBS for 30 min at 37°C and washed twice with PBS prior to use . For all ROS assays , 100 nM of PMA was used as positive control . To evaluate whether Skap2-/- neutrophils generated ROS after infection with another species of bacteria , a Y . pseudotuberculosis YPIII type 3 secretion mutant , ΔyscF was used ( Green et al . , 2016 ) . To detect RGD or IgG IC-stimulated ROS , superoxide detection by cytochrome C ( Sigma ) was performed as previously described ( Lowell et al . , 1996 ) with the following modifications . Cytochrome C was added to each well at a final concentration of 100 μM and 1 × 105 neutrophils were added to each well coated with either FBS or ligand . Absorbance at 490 nm and 550 nm were recorded at 37°C using Biotek Synergy HT . Superoxide concentration was calculated by ( OD550-OD490 ) x ( 2 . 11 × 104 M−1cm−1 ) , which is the extinction coefficient of cytochrome C ( Dahlgren et al . , 2007 ) . Total superoxide production was calculated by the sum of the area under the curves for the indicated time . To detect ROS production following K . pneumoniae exposure , isoluminol was performed as previously described ( Kobayashi et al . , 2016; Dahlgren et al . , 2007 ) with the following modifications . Neutrophils resuspended in HBSS+ , rested at RT for 30 min , were loaded with 50 μM isoluminol ( Sigma ) and 15 U/ml HRP ( Sigma ) , added to a 96-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well , and incubated at 37°C for 10 min . K . pneumoniae ( grown as described in gentamicin protection assays ) were then added to wells at a MOI of 2 . 5 or 5 , and the plate was centrifuged at 500 x g for 3 min at 4°C . For inhibitor studies , following isoluminol and HRP loading , DIV neutrophils were pre-treated with 10 nM PP2 ( Selleck Chemical ) , 2 μM R406 ( Selleck Chemical ) , 1 μM Ibrutinib ( Selleck Chemical ) , 10 μM Go 6983 ( Abcam ) , 1 μM U-73122 ( Sigma ) , 1 μM U-73433 ( Sigma ) , or DMSO ( 1:10 , 000 final concentration , Sigma ) vehicle control for 10 min at 37°C with 5% CO2 . A BioTek Synergy HT late reader was used to detect chemiluminescence ( RLU ) . Total ROS ( total RLU ) production was calculated by the sum of the area under the curves for the indicated time in figure legends . DIV neutrophils ( 7 . 5 × 105 cells/well ) in HBSS+ were plated onto 96-well 4HBX plates coated with 10% FBS . K . pneumoniae was added at MOI 40 and spun at 250 x g for 2 min . Cells were incubated at 37°C in presence of 5% CO2 for 10 or 15 min , lysed in 1X Novex buffer ( 4X stock: 40% sucrose , 6 . 82% Tris-Base , 6 . 66% Tris-HCL , 8% SDS , 0 . 06% EDTA , 0 . 075% Bromophenol Blue , 2 . 5 mM NaVO4 , 100 mM DTT ) and 5–7 . 5 × 105 cells equivalents were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE gel ( Invitrogen ) in MOPS buffer ( 10 . 5% MOPS , 6% Tris-Base , 5% SDS , 0 . 3% EDTA ) . Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF ( Millipore Sigma ) and subjected to western blot analysis using antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 unless otherwise indicated . Antibodies to phosphorylated proteins include Src Family-Y416 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) , Syk-Y352 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) and Pyk2-Y402 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . All blots were also probed with RhoGDI ( Cell Signaling Technology ) at a dilution of 1:1000 as loading control . Secondary LI-COR goat anti-mouse IRDye 800 CW ( Cell Signaling Technology ) and goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800 CW ( Cell Signaling Technology ) were used at a dilution of 1:20 , 000 . The Odyssey CLx LI-COR system was used to develop the blots and IS Image Studio was used for analysis and quantification of bands . Blots were then stripped with 7M Guanine Hydrochloride ( Fisher Scientific ) by incubating at 56°C for 30 min with shaking , washed 3 times in 1x TBST ( 0 . 1% Tween-20 in 1x TBS ) , and reprobed with antibodies for total proteins against Syk and Pyk2 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . The normalized protein level of pSFKs was calculated by taking the ratio of phosphorylated protein to RhoGDI loading control . The normalized protein levels of pSyk and pPyk2 were calculated by first taking the ratio of phosphorylated to total protein and then normalizing to the RhoGDI loading control . Normalized phospho-protein levels were used to calculate the fold change to unstimulated ( 0 min ) control within each group , or to unstimulated control of WT ( Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , the relative induction of phosphorylation in unstimulated controls was determined by dividing the fold change of each experiment by the average of the three experiments . Fold change was log transformed and subjected to statistical analysis . Differences between the groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA with either Tukey’s or Sidak’s post-test , where appropriate ( GraphPad Software version 7 ) . Log-transformed values were used for determining significance in experiments measuring CFU .",
         "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that can cause life-threatening infections – including pneumonia , blood stream infections , and urinary tract infections – in hospitalized patients . These infections can be difficult to treat because some K . pneumoniae are resistant to antibiotics . The bacteria are normally found in the human intestine , and they do not usually cause infections in healthy people . This implies that healthy people’s immune systems are better able to fend off K . pneumoniae infections; learning how could help scientists develop new ways to treat or prevent infections in hospitalized patients . In healthy people , a type of immune cell called neutrophils are the first line of defense against bacterial infections . Several different proteins are needed to activate neutrophils , including a protein called SKAP2 . But the role of this protein in fighting K . pneumoniae infections is not clear . To find out what role SKAP2 plays in the defense against pneumonia caused by K . pneumoniae , Nguyen et al . compared infections in mice with and without the protein . Mice lacking SKAP2 in their white blood cells had more bacteria in their lungs than normal mice . The experiments showed that neutrophils from mice with SKAP2 produce a burst of chemicals called “reactive oxygen species” , which can kill bacteria . But neutrophils without the protein do not . Without SKAP2 , several proteins that help produce reactive oxygen species do not work . Understanding the role of SKAP2 in fighting infections may help scientists better understand the immune system . This could help clinicians to treat conditions that cause it to be hyperactive or ineffective . More studies are needed to determine if SKAP2 works the same way in human neutrophils and if it works against all types of K . pneumoniae . If it does , then scientists might be able use this information to develop therapies that help the immune system fight infections .",

         "Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur following activation of latent liver-stages parasites ( hypnozoites ) causing new blood-stage infections weeks to months after the initial infection . We develop a within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypnozoites , and validate it against data from tropical strains of P . vivax . The within-host model is embedded in a P . vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death . The hypnozoite reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites , and some having intensely infected livers . Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P . vivax transmission . Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P . vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment .\nThe study of the transmission dynamics of vector-borne diseases such as Plasmodium falciparum malaria has a rich history , with a theoretical foundation based on the Ross-Macdonald models ( malERA Consultative Group on Modeling , 2011; Smith et al . , 2012; Reiner et al . , 2013; Smith et al . , 2014 ) , a class of mathematical models describing the transmission of a pathogen between human and vector hosts . In the case of P . falciparum , the parasite has a reservoir in both the human host and the Anopheles mosquito , with transmission occurring when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a human . Ross-Macdonald models have provided insights into the dynamics of P . falciparum transmission resulting in valuable guidance for historical and contemporary malaria control programmes , most notably the large reductions in transmission that are achievable if the lifespan of the mosquito is reduced through vector control ( Macdonald , 1952a; Macdonald , 1952b ) . In contrast to the extensive theory of the mathematical epidemiology of P . falciparum malaria ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) , P . vivax malaria has been comparatively neglected . This is in spite of P . vivax being the geographically most widely distributed species of malaria in the world , causing in the region of 80–300 million clinical episodes every year ( Mueller et al . , 2009a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) . P . falciparum models are not applicable to P . vivax as they fail to account for the reservoir of dormant liver stages ( hypnozoites ) which give rise to relapsing infections—one of the defining characteristics of the biology and epidemiology of P . vivax ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) . In natural transmission settings relapses are often undistinguishable from re-infections from new mosquito bites or recrudescences of existing blood-stage infections . When the origin of renewed parasitemia following primary P . vivax infection is unknown , it can be classified as a recurrent infection ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver , but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P . vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection ( Ishikawa et al . , 2003; Chamchod and Beier , 2013; Roy et al . , 2013 ) or as up to two broods of hypnozoites ( Dezoysa et al . , 1991 ) . Relapse patterns and their implications for transmission have also been investigated using statistical distributions for the time to first relapse ( Lover et al . , 2014 ) . Here we advance on existing work by considering how the number of hypnozoites in the liver contributes to patterns of relapse infections and the epidemiology and control of P . vivax . When a P . vivax infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a human , sporozoites are injected into the skin and migrate to the liver , where they invade hepatocytes and develop into either actively dividing schizonts or dormant hypnozoites . The development of actively dividing schizonts may lead to a primary blood-stage infection and potentially clinical malaria ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . Hypnozoites will lie dormant in the liver for weeks to years before activating to initiate new blood-stage infections . The biological mechanisms regulating the activation of hypnozoites remain unknown ( Mueller et al . , 2009a ) , although a number of triggers for relapses have been proposed , including fever caused by other pathogens such as P . falciparum ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) and exposure to Anopheles-specific proteins ( Hulden and Hulden , 2011 ) . There is considerable geographical variation in the timing and frequency of P . vivax relapse infections , with strains from tropical areas having an average time to first relapse of 3–6 weeks and long-latency strains from temperate areas relapsing within 6–9 months ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) . Beyond the first relapse , periodic patterns in multiple relapses from a single mosquito bite have been observed ( White , 2011 ) . For example , following a single infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax the time until next relapse has been observed to increase with each successive relapse ( Berliner et al . , 1948; White , 2011 ) . In contrast , temperate strains are associated with a long latency period until first relapse ( of the order of 6 months ) followed by short intervals between successive relapses ( Coatney et al . , 1950; Hankey et al . , 1953; White , 2011 ) . A descriptive epidemiology of P . vivax relapses will thus require estimation of three key quantities: ( i ) the time to first relapse , ( ii ) the number of relapses per primary infection , and ( iii ) the duration of hypnozoite carriage . In this manuscript , a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate . This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P . vivax malaria . We use this model to provide qualitative insights into the relative contribution of relapses to P . vivax transmission and illustrate the consequences for controlling P . vivax with vector control and anti-malarial drugs .\nFigure 1 shows the best fit within-host relapse model to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P . vivax: South America , South East Asia and Melanesia ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . In each ecological zone , the number of hypnozoites N and the hypnozoite activation rate α were correlated ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . For example , a short time to relapse could be explained by a single fast activating hypnozoite or a large number of slow activating hypnozoites . Longitudinal data where multiple relapses are observed in individuals would allow better estimation of the number of hypnozoites in the liver and the duration of hypnozoite carriage . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 004 The within-host model can be used to simulate beyond the first relapse infection . Figure 2 shows some sample relapse patterns from the within-host models for tropical and temperate strains of P . vivax . This model predicts notable dose-dependency with increased numbers of hypnozoites associated with a greater number of relapses and shorter time to first relapse . Following the long latency to first relapse in temperate strains , the interval between subsequent relapses is considerably shorter . The within-host model assumes that hypnozoites act independently of each other , and hence the time to next relapsing hypnozoite is exponentially distributed . In particular we do not predict periodicity between relapsing hypnozoites ( in the absence of external triggers [White , 2011; Shanks and White , 2013] ) . If the simulated data are censored such that relapses occurring within 14 days of a previous relapse remain undetected ( due to either prophylaxis by blood-stage anti-malarials or the presence of parasites from an existing infection ) then there is an apparent periodicity in detected relapses . The observed periodicity of relapses will be determined by the duration of prophylactic protection and not via the biological mechanisms considered here . The periodicity in detected relapses is most evident for large numbers of hypnozoites with the period being determined by the assumed duration of prophylactic protection ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . However , as has been previously argued , periodicity in relapses could also be attributable to a cycle of fevers initiating hypnozoite activation which in turn cause new blood-stage infections and malaria-associated fevers ( White , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 005Figure 2 . Sample relapse patterns for tropical and temperate strains of P . vivax . A relapse is assumed to be undetected if it occurs within 14 days of a detected relapse . Both tropical and temperate phenotypes exhibit dose dependency , with a larger number of hypnozoites giving rise to a greater number of relapses and shorter times to first relapse . For larger numbers of hypnozoites ( N = 50 ) , periodicity in detected relapses is observed . The appearance of this periodicity is due to the undetected relapses .

The red curves denote the time between detected relapses: it is assumed that within 14 days of a detected relapse some activating hypnozoites can go undetected due to anti-malarial prophylaxis or the presence of blood-stage parasites . The grey curve denotes the expected time between all consecutively activating hypnozoites . The dashed line denotes a 3 week duration which has been regularly been observed as a common period between consecutive relapses ( White , 2011 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 006 Figure 3 shows the predicted number of relapsing hypnozoites in a population exposed to P . vivax in the absence of new infections . For tropical strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver is expected to decrease exponentially , but the proportion of individuals carrying hypnozoites is expected to decrease at a slower rate as an individual can relapse even if they have just one hypnozoite ( Figure 3A ) . For temperate strains the mean number of hypnozoites in the liver decreases slowly , as hypnozoites remain in the long-latency phase for approximately 6 months ( Figure 3B ) . The model allows estimation of time to second , third and consecutive relapses in addition to estimates of time to first relapse obtainable via survival analysis of patient data ( Lover and Coker , 2013; Battle et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 3C , D ) . The expected number of relapsing hypnozoites per individual is expected to follow an approximately exponential distribution ( Figure 3E , F ) in agreement with empirical observations ( Horing , 1947; White , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 007Figure 3 .

EIR is a measurement of the number of infectious bites per person per year . The proportion of people infected with hypnozoites is predicted to be higher than the proportion infected with P . vivax blood-stage parasites . For a given EIR , P . vivax blood-stage prevalence is predicted to be higher than P . falciparum prevalence as a single mosquito bite can give rise to multiple blood-stage infections . However this does not account for the longer duration of P . falciparum infections as a consequence of antigenic switching ( Molineaux et al . , 2001 ) , and the important role of heterogeneity in exposure ( Smith et al . , 2005 ) . With the exception of the P . vivax hypnozoite rate , these quantities can be measured in epidemiological field studies ( Smith et al . , 2005; Kelly-Hope and McKenzie , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 008Figure 4 .

EIR was varied by changing the number of mosquitoes per person m . ( B ) The number of hypnozoites per person is expected to increase with transmission intensity . The black line denotes the median number of hypnozoites , and the shaded areas denote the 50% and 95% ranges . ( C ) The distribution of the hypnozoite reservoir when PvPR = 50% . The grey bar represents individuals with zero hypnozoites . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 008 Figure 4B shows how the median number of hypnozoites increases with increasing P . vivax transmission . Figure 4C shows the distribution in the number of hypnozoites when PvPR = 50% . The number of hypnozoites per individual is predicted to be over-dispersed following a negative binomial distribution . Thus some individuals will harbour a large number of hypnozoites while some will have none . This phenomenon will be further amplified if there is heterogeneity in exposure where some individuals receive a large number of mosquito bites . The impact of malaria control interventions will depend on how effectively the parasite is targeted in each of the reservoirs in the mosquito , the blood and the liver . Figure 5 shows the qualitative effects of malaria control on the transmission dynamics of P . falciparum and P . vivax . Vector control with insecticide treated nets ( ITNs ) or indoor residual spraying ( IRS ) is assumed to increase mosquito mortality . The introduction of vector control is expected to cause a rapid decline in P . falciparum parasite rate ( PfPR ) , and a smaller and slower decline in P . vivax ( Figure 5A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 009Figure 5 .

Transmission model incorporating treatment of new infections with blood-stage anti-malarials . Treatment coverage χ is assumed , that is , the proportion of new blood-stage infections that receive treatment with blood-stage anti-malarials . There will be a delay between the emergence of parasites into the blood-stream and the administration of treatment following symptoms . This stage is described by treatment compartment Ti and lasts 1/ν = 7 days . Importantly , transmission to mosquitoes is possible during this stage as P . vivax gametocytes ( the sexual stage of the parasite that can be transmitted to mosquitoes ) are present in the blood very early on in the infection . Following treatment , individuals progress to a period of prophylactic protection Pi , during which they are not susceptible to new blood-stage infections but may still acquire hypnozoites from new bites from infectious mosquitoes . It is assumed that individuals remain under prophylactic protection for 1/ξ = 14 days after which they return to being susceptible Si .

Transmission model incorporating treatment of new infections with blood-stage anti-malarials and primaquine . The incorporation of primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is accounted for by assuming that treatment clears all hypnozoites from the liver as well as clearing blood-stage infections . A 14 day daily dosing regimen of primaquine which has proven efficacy at preventing relapses . In particular we assume treatment eliminates all hypnozoites , so that treated individuals move to compartment P0 ( under prophylaxis from treatment and with all hypnozoites removed ) . The 14 day treatment regimen is assumed to provide a period of prophylactic protection against new hypnozoite infection , that is , new hypnozoites cannot be acquired while primaquine is being administered . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 011 Figure 5B shows the effect of targeting the parasite reservoir in the blood by providing first-line treatment for new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or artemisinin combination therapies ( ACTs ) . See details of how treatment was implemented in the model are provided in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , 2 . Increasing treatment coverage leads to reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P . falciparum and P . vivax . Notably the reduction in the P . vivax hypnozoite rate is slow as the hypnozoite reservoir is not directly targeted . The hypnozoite reservoir can be directly targeted using a drug such as primaquine that can eliminate hypnozoites from the liver ( Wells et al . , 2010 ) . The inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in both the P . vivax parasite rate and hypnozoite rate ( Figure 5C ) , as individuals being treated for blood-stage P . vivax infections will also have their hypnozoites removed . A consequence of this strategy is that the hypnozoite reservoir can be targeted efficiently , as individuals with the most hypnozoites are most likely to relapse and potentially be detected by health systems . Figure 6 shows how the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment regimens preferentially targets the most intense infections , with the greatest reductions observed in individuals with the most hypnozoites . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 012Figure 6 .

Individuals with large numbers of hypnozoites are more likely to experience new blood-stage infections and hence become targeted for treatment and have their hypnozoites removed . This results in a selective targeting of the most intensely infected individuals . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 012\nRelapse infections arising from the activation of hypnozoites in the human liver have important consequences for the transmission dynamics of P . vivax . Hypnozoites in the liver constitute a third malaria parasite reservoir , in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito also present for P . falciparum . Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Macdonald models of malaria transmission through the addition of a state to represent the hypnozoite reservoir ( Roy et al . , 2013 ) , or as demonstrated here , through consideration of the number of hypnozoites in the liver . This allows the intensity of hypnozoite infection to be estimated which is crucial for understanding patterns of relapse infections ( White , 2011 ) and evaluating the effect of interventions such as primaquine treatment that directly target the hypnozoite reservoir . Hypnozoites are assumed to be subjected to two processes: activation at constant rate α , and death at constant rate µ . By considering infection with batches of hypnozoites , these simple processes can explain many of the complex patterns observed in P . vivax relapses ( see Box 1 ) . A key assumption in the proposed model is the constant activation of hypnozoites . This implies that relapses can occur immediately after primary P . vivax infection , in contrast to suggestions that the first relapse does not occur until 2–3 weeks later . The best evidence on early relapses comes from treatment efficacy studies where patients treated for P . vivax are followed for recurrent infection for 42 days ( Douglas et al . , 2010 ) . Except in cases with documented chloroquine resistance ( Price et al . , 2014 ) , recurrent infections are rarely observed prior to day 14 , however the inclusion of long-lasting anti-malarials in treatment regimens provides prophylaxis during this period making detection of parasites unlikely . In a recent study of the slowly eliminated drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) Tarning et al . ( 2014 ) tested a model where relapses occur in bursts every 3 weeks , but it arguably provided no better fit to the data than a model of constant hypnozoite activation . Testing the hypothesis of constant activation would require follow up of patients treated with rapidly eliminated artemisinin monotherapy , a challenging proposition given the concerns over artemisinin resistant P . falciparum ( Ashley et al . , 2014 ) . Although the model captures the key drivers of the dynamics of P . vivax transmission , it is a simplified representation subject to a number of limiting assumptions . The potential role of triggers of hypnozoite activation such as febrile illness ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) are not accounted for . There is no heterogeneity or seasonality in transmission , and no age structure . Incorporation of the acquisition of natural immunity into the model will be particularly important for settings with high transmission intensity where immunity has a role in regulating blood-stage infections ( Mueller et al . , 2013 ) . It is assumed that all individuals infected with blood-stage parasites are capable of transmitting to mosquitoes . Similar to the corresponding P . falciparum models , incorporation of these factors would change the quantitative predictions of the model , but not its qualitative behaviour . P . falciparum and P . vivax parasite prevalence ( PfPR and PvPR ) are the most widely reported and best validated metrics of malaria transmission from epidemiological studies ( Gething et al . , 2011a; Gething et al . , 2012 ) providing measurements of the proportion of individuals with detectable blood-stage parasites . In settings with similar levels of P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission , the model predicts PvPR to be greater than PfPR due to the additional blood-stage infections arising from relapses . However , this does not agree with empirical observations which find PfPR to be similar to or greater than PvPR ( Snounou and White , 2004; Mueller et al . , 2009b ) . This is most likely explained by the rapid acquisition of immunity to P . vivax ( Koepfli et al . , 2013; Mueller et al . , 2013 ) the low detectability of P . vivax blood-stage infections ( Harris et al . , 2010 ) , and the longer durations of P . falciparum blood-stage infection ( Molineaux et al . , 2001 ) not captured in the model . Furthermore , the additional P . vivax parasite reservoir in the liver means that PfPR and PvPR are not directly comparable metrics . Thus if a parasitological survey indicates similar parasite prevalence , a greater control effort will be required to reduce P . vivax transmission than to reduce P . falciparum transmission because of the additional infections emerging from the hypnozoite reservoir . The model described here allows the proportion of individuals harbouring hypnozoites to be estimated given metrics such as PvPR . The number of hypnozoites per person is predicted to be over-dispersed with some individuals with intensely infected livers and most carrying few or no hypnozoites ( Figure 4C ) . Estimates of the prevalence and intensity of hypnozoite infection will be dependent on both the uncertainty in the measurable data and the model assumptions . Vector control with ITNs or IRS , and treatment with effective anti-malarial drugs are the cornerstones of malaria control efforts targeting the parasite in the vector and the human host , however they are predicted to have different effects on P . vivax and P . falciparum transmission . Vector control interventions that increase mosquito mortality are expected to cause greater reductions in PfPR than PvPR ( Figure 5A ) , as higher levels of P . vivax transmission can be maintained with fewer mosquito bites . This has been observed in both Thailand ( Sattabongkot et al . , 2004 ) and Brazil ( Coura et al . , 2006 ) where increased vector control has caused greater reductions in P . falciparum than P . vivax . First-line treatment of new blood-stage infections with anti-malarial drugs such as chloroquine or ACTs is predicted to cause moderate reductions in blood-stage prevalence of both P . falciparum and P . vivax ( Figure 5B ) . The addition of primaquine to first-line treatment regimens is expected to cause large reductions in P . vivax blood-stage prevalence , as individuals with the most intense hypnozoite infections are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment and hence have their hypnozoites eliminated . The potential to simultaneously target parasite reservoirs in the blood and liver may turn the cause of P . vivax parasites' robust transmission into its Achilles' heel . In P . vivax and P . falciparum co-endemic regions , heterogeneity in exposure to mosquito bites may cause associations between P . falciparum fevers and the risk of future P . vivax relapses ( Douglas et al . , 2011 ) . Thus the inclusion of primaquine in first-line treatment for P . falciparum may also reduce P . vivax transmission . In addition to inclusion in first-line treatment regimens , primaquine can also be administered as part of mass drug administration ( MDA ) programmes . In treatment-reinfection studies of Papua New Guinean children ( Betuela et al . , 2012; Robinson et al . , unpublished ) , mass administration of drugs such as chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine successfully cleared P . vivax blood-stage infections but rapid recurrence of infection was observed during follow-up—most likely due to relapses . The addition of primaquine to the treatment regimen caused large reductions in the rate of recurrent infections . Although primaquine treatment clears the hypnozoite reservoir , it requires a difficult 14 day treatment regimen , and is not without risk due to vulnerability to haemolytic toxicity among glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficient patients ( Howes et al . , 2013 ) . Individuals should thus be tested for G6PD deficiency ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) before the administration of primaquine . A primaquine analogue , tafenoquine , is currently undergoing phase three trials and is likely to be licensed for use by 2017 ( Llanos-Cuentas et al . , 2014 ) . Tafenoquine requires a single dose alongside a 3 day chloroquine regimen , but is subject to the same risks in G6PD deficient patients . A quantitative model of P . vivax transmission will allow for the benefits of primaquine treatment to be weighed against the risks of G6PD deficiency and the costs of G6PD testing . Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P . vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector , the blood and the liver . In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites ( malERA Consultative Group on Diagnoses and Diagnostics , 2011 ) , models will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir , either indirectly via vector control and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly via primaquine treatment .\nFollowing infection with a tropical strain of P . vivax , the population dynamics of hypnozoites in the liver can be described by a within-host model where each hypnozoite is subject to two processes: ( i ) activation leading to relapse infection; and ( ii ) death , either of the hypnozoite itself or the host hepatocyte ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . Constant activation ( α ) and death ( µ ) rates are assumed implying hypnozoite residence time in the liver is exponentially distributed . The long latency of temperate strains before first relapse can be accounted for by assuming a period of dormancy during which hypnozoites must wait before they can activate . A schematic representation of the within-host model is presented in Figure 7 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 014Figure 7 . Within-host model schematic of relapsing hypnozoites in the liver . Hypnozoites from tropical strains of P . vivax will progress to the relapsing phase where they are subject to two processes: death and activation leading to relapse . Hypnozoites from temperate strains will begin in a temperate long-latency phase where they must wait before progressing to the relapsing phase .

An individual infected with N hypnozoites of a tropical strain begins in the HNN compartment and progresses to HN0 as hypnozoites activate or die . An individual infected with N hypnozoites of a temperate strain begins in the LNN , 1 compartment , and progresses down the flow diagram through the M steps during the period of long-latency . During this time they may also move to the right along the flow diagram as the number of hypnozoites reduces due to death . After passing through the M compartments for the long-latency phase , infections will enter the relapsing phase where relapse can occur . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 015 The tropical relapse model is assumed to begin with an initial population of N hypnozoites , each of which can either activate at rate α , or die at rate µ , independently of each other . The number of hypnozoites in the liver will decay exponentially with an expected Ne− ( µ+α ) t hypnozoites at time t . Let HiN ( t ) denote the probability that i of N hypnozoites remain in the liver after time t . The hypnozoite population dynamics can be described by the following set of equations: ( 1 ) dHNNdt=− ( μ+α ) NHNNdHiNdt=− ( μ+α ) iHiN+ ( μ+α ) ( i+1 ) Hi+1N , i=0…N−1 Equation 1 can be solved analytically to give: ( 2 ) HiN ( t ) = ( Ni ) e−N ( μ+α ) t ( e ( μ+α ) t−1 ) N−i Define PjN ( t ) to be the probability that j relapses have occurred by time t . This can be calculated as follows: if i hypnozoites remain in the liver , then N − i have either activated or died . The probability of each hypnozoite activating is αμ+α . The probability that j of N − i hypnozoites have activated can thus be calculated from a binomial distribution . Summing over the allowable number of hypnozoites ( at least j hypnozoites must have activated or died for j relapses to be observed ) gives: ( 3 ) PjN ( t ) =∑i=0N−j ( N−ij ) ( αμ+α ) j ( μμ+α ) N−i−jHiN ( t ) = ( Nj ) αjμN−j ( μ+α ) N ( 1−e− ( μ+α ) t ) N ( 1+μ+αμ1e ( μ+α ) t−1 ) N−j Equations 1–3 describe the population dynamics of hypnozoites in a single individual with N hypnozoites in the absence of exposure to new infections . In a population of individuals , we would expect substantial variation in the numbers of hypnozoites due to heterogeneity in exposure and the variation in sporozoite inoculum from each infectious mosquito bite ( Beier et al . , 1991; Medica and Sinnis , 2005; White et al . , 2013 ) . Based on evidence that the number of sporozoites injected with a mosquito bite approximately follows a geometric distribution ( Beier et al . , 1991 ) , we assume that the number of hypnozoites following a primary infection is also geometrically distributed . If the mean number of hypnozoites is N , then the probability of k hypnozoites is ( NN+1 ) k1N+1 . Assuming a geometrically distributed number of hypnozoites , the three quantities describing the epidemiology of relapses can be estimated in terms of the within-host parameters . The expected number of relapsing hypnozoites is: ( 4 ) h=∑k=0∞ ( NN+1 ) k1N+1︸probability of k initial hypnozoites k αα+μ︸probability of each hypnozoite relapsing=Nαμ+α The mean duration of hypnozoite carriage is: ( 5 ) 1γ=∑k=0∞ ( NN+1 ) k1N+1︸probability of k initial hypnozoites∑i=1k1i1μ+α︸duration of k hypnozoites=log ( N+1 ) μ+α The expected time to first relapse is: ( 6 ) 1f=∑k=1∞[ ( NN+1 ) k1N]︸probability of k initial hypnozoites∑i=1k[ ( μμ+α ) k−iαμ+α/ ( 1− ( μμ+α ) k ) ]︸probability of hypnozoite i being first to relapse∑j=0k−i1k−j1μ+α︸time to relapse The within-host relapse model describes a baseline scenario in the absence of potential external triggers for relapse such as fever ( Shanks and White , 2013 ) . Underlying assumptions of this model are: ( i ) each hypnozoite acts independently of other hypnozoites , for example , hypnozoites will not activate in batches due to mechanisms such as quorum sensing; and , ( ii ) hypnozoite death occurs at a constant rate , due to either death of the hypnozoite within the hepatocyte or death of the hepatocyte itself ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . The activation of a hypnozoite may not directly correspond to a detected relapse . For example , an infection arising from two hypnozoites activating within a day of each other is likely to be classified as a single relapse . The within-host model can be extended to account for temperate strains of P . vivax . We assume that before a hypnozoite is capable of activating , it must undergo a long-latency phase of duration d . During this period hypnozoites are subject to death at rate µ . In particular , we assume that the time spent in the temperate long-latency phase can be described by a gamma distribution with mean d and variance d2/M . This gamma distribution can be simulated by M successive compartments with exponential waiting times 1/δ = d/M . Increasing the number of compartments M reduces the variance in the duration of the dormancy period ( Wearing et al . , 2005 ) . Following a primary infection where N hypnozoites of a temperate phenotype develop in the liver , we define Li , jN as the probability that i of N hypnozoites are waiting in long-latency compartment number j , then the number of dormant and potentially active hypnozoites can be described by the following system of differential equations .

Equation 7 cannot be solved analytically and must be computed numerically to calculate HiN ( t ) and Li , jN ( t ) . A greater deal of uncertainty surrounds the biological processes accounting for the initial long-latency phase observed in temperate strains of P . vivax . In the model implemented here , it is assumed that all hypnozoites in an infection must undergo some waiting period before any of them can activate , and that during the long-latency phase hypnozoites are at risk of death due to natural hepatocyte death . We next embedded the within-host model for tropical relapses in a model for the transmission of P . vivax between humans and mosquitoes ( Figure 8 ) . The transmission dynamics are driven by two processes: ( i ) transmission of parasites through mosquito bites; and ( ii ) relapsing of liver-stage hypnozoites to cause new blood-stage infections . As per the standard Ross-Macdonald theory , the force of blood-stage infections in humans can be calculated as the product of the number of mosquitoes per human m , the rate at which each mosquito bites a human host a , the probability of transmission from mosquito to human following an infectious bite b , and the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious IM , to give λ = mabIM . Parameter values are provided in Table 1 . The force of infection on mosquitoes can be calculated in a similar manner . We assume that people can be susceptible ( Si ) or infected with blood-stage parasites ( Ii ) , where i denotes the number of hypnozoites in the liver . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04692 . 016Figure 8 .

The increase in hypnozoites in the liver is determined by the force of infection λ and the number of hypnozoites per infection N , and the decrease is due to hypnozoite activation α and death µ .

In the absence of super-infection , the recovery from blood-stage infection is ρi=r . Accounting for super-infections ( Dietz and Molineaux , 1973; Smith et al . , 2012 ) gives ρi=λ+iαeλ+iαr−1 . The within-host model for tropical relapses was fitted in a Bayesian framework to data on time to first relapse infection from three ecological zones with tropical strains of P . vivax: South America , South East Asia and Melanesia ( see Source data 1 ) . The data are described in detail by Battle et al . ( 2014 ) . Individual-level data on time to first recurrence was collated from individuals exposed to P . vivax infection ( either via natural exposure or artificial challenge ) and mostly followed up in the absence of exposure to new infections ( Battle et al . , 2014 ) . The likelihood of the tropical relapse model can be evaluated by applying the model to the data on time to first relapse infection . The first detected relapse will occur after clearance of parasites from the primary infection and after the period of prophylactic protection from anti-malarial drugs . Define QN ( t ) to be the probability that at least 1 of N hypnozoites has relapsed by time t . ( 9 ) QN ( t ) =1−P0N ( t ) =1− ( μ+αe− ( μ+α ) tμ+α ) N Accounting for a geometrically distributed number of hypnozoites gives: ( 10 ) QG ( N ) ( t ) =∑k=0∞1N+1 ( NN+1 ) kQk ( t ) where G ( N ) denotes a geometric distribution . An individual j followed up after a primary P . vivax infection will either relapse ( Ij = 1 ) or avoid infection ( Ij = 0 ) . Denote τj to be the time of detection of infection , or if uninfected , the time until the end of follow up . The likelihood of the parameters θ = {N , α , µ} given the data Dj = {Ij , τj} is: ( 11 ) L ( θ|Dj ) = ( dQG ( N ) dt|t=τj ) Ij ( 1−QG ( N ) ( τj ) ) 1−Ij The log-likelihood ( LL ) for all j individuals is: ( 12 ) LL=∑j ( Ijlog ( dQG ( N ) dt|t=τj ) + ( 1−Ij ) log ( 1−QG ( N ) ( τj ) ) ) Data on time to first relapse were not sufficiently informative to estimate the three parameters simultaneously and hence prior distributions were assumed . N was assumed to have an informative gamma prior distribution with median 10 ( 95% credible interval ( CrI ) : 1 , 28 ) ( Beier et al . , 1991 ) . µ was assumed to have an informative gamma prior distribution with median 1/200 ( 95% CrI: 1/309 , 1/140 ) day−1 ( Malato et al . , 2011 ) . α was assumed to have an uninformative uniform prior distribution U ( 0 , 1 ) . The likelihood in equation ( Ishikawa et al . , 2003 ) was sampled using a Metropolis–Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm and the posterior parameter distributions estimated ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The posterior median parameter estimates and 95% credible intervals are presented in Supplementary file 1 .",
         "Malaria is one of the world's most deadly infections , causing 100s of 1000s of deaths each year despite being both preventable and curable . Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites , which are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes . When a mosquito bites a human , Plasmodium is injected into the bloodstream with the mosquito's saliva . The parasite then travels through the bloodstream to the liver , infects liver cells and multiplies within those cells without causing any noticeable symptoms . After remaining silent in the liver for weeks or months , the now abundant parasite ruptures the host liver cell , re-enters the bloodstream , and begins infecting red blood cells . If another mosquito bites the infected individual and takes a blood meal , the parasite moves into the mosquito and the cycle of transmission continues . There are several species of Plasmodium that are known to cause malaria . The most widely studied species is P . falciparum , which also causes one of the deadliest types of malaria . However , another Plasmodium species called P . vivax is the most widely distributed species and , despite being less virulent than P . falciparum , is particularly dangerous because it causes recurring malaria . In contrast to P . falciparum , P . vivax has the ability to form hypnozoites: a dormant form of the parasite that can remain inside liver cells for long periods of time , sometimes for years . The reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites can regularly populate the bloodstream with the infectious form of the parasite , triggering relapses of malaria . Even if an individual suffering a relapse receives prompt treatment to clear parasites in the blood , more parasites may emerge from the liver and cause new blood-stage infections . White et al . developed a mathematical model to help understand how P . vivax is transmitted . Unlike many of the established models of malaria transmission , the new model accounts for the reservoir of P . vivax hypnozoites in the liver , and assumes that hypnozoites in the reservoir either die , or are activated and enter the bloodstream , at a constant rate . This produces patterns that closely match how often relapses occur in patients . White et al . go on to predict that although many infected people have few or no hypnozoites in their liver , some have many hypnozoites , and these people are more likely to suffer from malaria relapses . This suggests that if the initial treatments given to malaria sufferers incorporate additional drugs that kill the hypnozoites in the liver , then it may be possible to substantially reduce the extent of P . vivax transmission .",

         "When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year , more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) is emitted to the atmosphere . Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth . With an original modelling approach , calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia , we link regional differences in climate , soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery . We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall , high seasonality ) . We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia .\nWith on-going climate change , attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon ( C ) cycles ( Griggs and Noguer , 2002 ) , and in particular to the 2 . 1 ± 1 . 1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests ( Grace et al . , 2014 ) . Among those disturbances , selective logging , i . e . the selective harvest of a few merchantable tree species , is particularly widespread: in the Brazilian Amazon alone , about 2 Mha yr−1 were logged in 1999–2002 ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period , and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 ( Huang and Asner , 2010 ) which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to deforested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing , most selectively logged forests remain as forested areas ( Asner et al . , 2006 ) and may recover C stocks ( West et al . , 2014 ) . Previously logged Amazonian forests may thus accumulate large amounts of C ( Pan et al . , 2011 ) , but this C uptake is difficult to accurately estimate , because while detecting selective logging from space is increasingly feasible ( Frolking et al . , 2009 ) ( even if very few of the IPCC models effectively account for logging ) , directly quantifying forest recovery remains challenging ( Asner et al . , 2009; Houghton et al . , 2012; Goetz et al . , 2015 ) . Studies based on field measurements ( e . g . Sist and Ferreira , 2007; Blanc et al . , 2009; West et al . , 2014; Vidal et al . , 2016 ) , sometimes coupled with modeling approaches ( e . g . Gourlet-Fleury et al . , 2005; Valle et al . , 2007 ) or airborne light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) measurements ( e . g . Andersen et al . , 2014 ) have assessed post-logging dynamics at particular sites . Nonetheless , to our knowledge no spatially-explicit investigation of post-logging C dynamics at the Amazon biome scale is available . C losses from selective logging are determined by harvest intensity ( i . e . number of trees felled or volume of wood extracted ) plus the care with which harvest operations are conducted , which affects the amount of collateral damage . After logging , C losses continue for several years due to elevated mortality rates of trees injured during harvesting operations ( Shenkin et al . , 2015 ) . Logged forests may recover their aboveground carbon stocks ( ACS ) via enhanced growth of survivors and recruited trees ( Blanc et al . , 2009 ) . Full recovery of pre-disturbance ACS in logged stands reportedly requires up to 125 years , depending primarily on disturbance intensity ( Rutishauser et al . , 2015 ) . The underlying recovery processes ( i . e . tree mortality , growth and recruitment ) are likely to vary with the clear geographical patterns in forest structure and dynamics across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield . In particular , northeast-southwest gradients have been reported for ACS ( Malhi and Wright , 2004 ) , net primary productivity ( Aragão et al . , 2009 ) , wood density ( Baker et al . , 2004 ) , and floristic composition ( ter Steege et al . , 2006 ) . Such gradients coincide with climate and edaphic conditions that range from nearly a seasonal nutrient-limited in the northeast to seasonally dry and nutrient-rich in the southwest ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . These regional differences in biotic and abiotic conditions largely constrain demographic processes that ultimately shape forest C balances . Here we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia sensu lato ( that includes the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ) . Based on long-term ( 8–30 year ) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites ( Sist et al . , 2015 ) across Amazonia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) that cover a large gradient of disturbance intensities ( ACS losses ranging from 1% to 71% ) were used to model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes ( Figure 1 ) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework . We quantify the effect of pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics [the site’s average pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) and the relative difference between each plot and a⁢c⁢s⁢0 as a proxy of forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) ] , disturbance intensity [percentage of pre-logging ACS lost ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) ] , and interactions with the environment [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) , and soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) ] ( Figure 2 ) on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS changes converge to a theoretical steady state ( as in Figure 1 , see Materials and methods for more details ) . With global maps of ACS ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) , climatic conditions ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and soil bulk density ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , we up-scale our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss , which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( Blanc et al . , 2009; Martin et al . , 2015; West et al . , 2014 ) . Summing these ACS changes over time gives the net post-disturbance rate of ACS accumulation . Disentangling ACS recovery into demographic processes and cohorts is essential to reveal mechanisms underlying ACS responses to disturbance and to make more robust predictions of ACS recovery compared to an all-in-one approach ( see Appendix ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 003Figure 1 . Post-disturbance annual ACS changes of survivors and recruits in 133 Amazonian selectively logged plots . Data is available between the year of minimum ACS ( t=0 ) and t=30 years . ACS changes are: recruits’ ACS growth ( orange ) , recruits’ ACS loss ( gold ) , new recruits’ ACS ( red ) , survivors’ ACS growth ( light green ) and survivors’ ACS loss ( dark green ) . Thick solid lines are the maximum-likelihood predictions ( for an average plot , when all covariates are null ) , and dashed lines are the model theoretical behaviour . New recruits’ ACS , recruits’ ACS growth , and recruits’ ACS loss converge over time to constant values . A dynamic equilibrium is then reached: ACS gain from recruitment and recruits’ growth compensate ACS loss from recruits’ mortality . Survivors’ ACS growth and loss . decline over time and tend to zero when all initial survivors have died .

The closer the dots are to the x=y line , the better the prediction . Dot transparency is proportional to the observation weight: transparent dots are low-weight observations . Because mortality is a stochastic event , ACS loss has poorer predictions than ACS gain which is a more continuous process . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 007\nAt a given site , variations of post-logging ACS changes are explained with the disturbance intensity ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) and the relative forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) . At high disturbance intensity ( positive l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) as well as in relatively immature forests ( negative d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) , ACS gain from recruits is high: recruitment decreases slowly ( Figure 2b and Figure 3b ) and recruits’ growth increases rapidly ( Figure 2c and Figure 3c ) . In the same conditions of high disturbance intensity , survivors’ ACS growth is lower in the first years following logging than for low disturbance intensities , but declines slowly ( Figure 2a and Figure 3a ) . Disturbance intensity and relative forest maturity have a weak effect on ACS loss from both survivors and recruits ( Figures 2d , e and 3d , e ) . Overall , net ACS change stays high longer at high disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008Figure 3 .

( d ) Survivors’ ACS loss . ( e ) Recruits’ ACS loss . ( f ) Net ACS change . The net ACS change is the sum of all five ACS changes . ACS changes were calculated with all parameters set to their maximum-likelihood value and covariates ( except standardized disturbance intensity l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) set to 0 . Time since minimum ACS varies from 0 to 30 year ( i . e . the calibration interval ) and disturbance intensity ranges between 5% and 60% of initial ACS loss . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008 Variations of post-logging ACS changes between sites are explained with the mean ACS of each site ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) , climatic conditions [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) ] and the soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) . Contribution of survivors’ growth to ACS recovery declined slowly in sites with low a⁢c⁢s⁢0 and high water stress ( low precipitation , high seasonality and high bulk density ) ( Figure 2a ) . Survivors’ ACS loss showed the opposite pattern ( Figure 2d ) except in apparent response to high seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) that slowed the post-disturbance rates of decline of both ACS growth and loss . Despite slower recruits’ ACS growth in sites with high pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) , no other regional covariate had significant effects on recruits’ ACS changes ( Figure 2b , c and e ) . While no significant environmental effects were detected for recruits’ ACS changes ( Figures 2 and 4 ) , the survivors showed a highly structured regional gradient: ( i ) ACS gain from survivors’ ACS growth is high in the west and in the Guiana Shield , but low in the south ( Figure 4a ) , whereas ( ii ) survivors’ ACS loss is low in the south and in the Guiana Shield but high in the west ( Figure 4d ) . To illustrate how these regional differences will be critical for future ACS across Amazonia , we developed a map of net ACS recovery over the first 10 years after a 40% ACS loss by integrating the sum of ACS change predictions through time ( Figure 5 ) . Across the region , net ACS recovery over the first ten years after a 40% ACS loss is predicted to be 17 ± 7 Mg C ha-1 , with higher values in the west and in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 5a ) . The uncertainty in predictions was low to medium ( coefficient of variation under 40% ) in 82% of the mapped area , and high ( coefficient of variation above 50% ) in 5% of the mapped area ( Figure 5b ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 009Figure 4 . Predicted cumulative ACS changes ( Mg C ha−1 ) over the first 10 year after losing 40% of ACS .

( a ) median predictions . ( b ) coefficient of variation ( per pixel ) . Four areas were arbitrarily chosen to illustrate four different geographical behaviours: ( 1 ) the Guiana Shield and ( 2 ) northwestern Amazonia are two areas with high ACS recovery; the Guiana Shield has higher initial ACS and slower ACS dynamics whereas northwestern Amazonia has lower initial ACS and faster ACS dynamics . ( 3 ) central Amazonia has intermediate ACS recovery . ( 4 ) southern Amazonia has low ACS recovery . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 010 Four areas ( Figure 5a ) were selected to represent four contrasted cases of net ACS recovery in time ( Figure 6 ) : two areas , northwestern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield , with high ACS accumulation ( 21 ± 3 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) , one intermediate area , central Amazonia ( 15 ± 1 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) and one area with low ACS accumulation , southern Amazonia ( 12 ± 3 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) . Survivors’ contribution to the sum of ACS gains ( recruitment and growth ) over the first 10 years after disturbance was 71 ± 4% in the Guiana Shield , 71 ± 2% in the west; 63 ± 4% in central Amazonia and 55 ± 6% in the south . Predicted net ACS recovery ( Figure 5 ) and survivors’ ACS growth ( Figure 4a ) are highly correlated: ρ=0 . 90 ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011Figure 6 . Predicted contribution of annual ACS changes in ACS recovery in four regions of Amazonia ( Figure 5 ) . The white line is the net annual ACS recovery , i . e . the sum of all annual ACS changes . Survivors’ ( green ) and recruits’ ( orange ) contribution are positive for ACS gains ( survivors’ ACS growth , new recruits’ ACS and recruits’ ACS growth ) and negative for survivors’ and recruits’ ACS loss . Areas with higher levels of transparency and dotted lines are out of the calibration period ( 0–30 year ) . In the Guiana Shield and in nothwestern Amazonia , high levels of net ACS recovery are explained by large ACS gain from survivors’ growth . Extrapolation was based on global rasters: topsoil bulk density from the Harmonized global soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , precipitation data from Worldclim ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and biomass stocks from Avitabile et al . ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) map . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011\nContrasting post-disturbance ACS dynamics were detected among the western Amazon , Guiana Shield , and southern Amazon ( Figure 4 ) . ( i ) In the western Amazon , environmental stress is reduced due to fertile soils and abundant , mostly non-seasonal precipitation , but forests are prone to frequent and sometimes large-scale wind-induced disturbances ( Espírito-Santo et al . , 2014 ) . Such conditions of low stress and high disturbance tend to favor fast-growing species with rapid life cycles ( He et al . , 2013 ) , which results in fast ACS gain and loss from survivors even after the logging disturbance ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . ( ii ) Forests of the Guiana Shield are generally dense and grow on nutrient-poor soils ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) , where wood productivity is highly constrained by competition for key nutrients , especially phosphorus and nitrogen ( Santiago , 2015; Mercado et al . , 2011 ) . The short duration pulse of nutrients released from readily decomposed stems , twigs and leaves of trees damaged and killed by logging may thus explain the substantial but limited-duration increase in growth of survivors on these nutrient-poor soils ( Figure 6 ) . Yet post-disturbance ACS loss from survivors’ mortality decreases slowly in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 6 ) . This is consistent with the low mortality rates and the high tree longevity reported in old-growth forests of this region ( Phillips et al . , 2004 ) . ( iii ) In the southern Amazon , high seasonal water stress is the main constraint on ACS recovery ( Wagner et al . , 2016 ) . Stress-tolerant trees are generally poor competitors ( He et al . , 2013 ) and this may explain the slow ACS changes of survivors in this region ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . Finally , Central Amazonia is a transition zone for the main environmental and biotic gradients found in Amazonia: ( 1 ) a competition gradient between dense and nutrient-poor northeastern forests and nutrient-rich western forests; ( 2 ) an environmental gradient between northern wet forests and southern drier forests ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . Across Amazonia , survivors contribute most to post-disturbance ACS recovery . In regions where survivors’ ACS gain is high ( west and northeast ) , net ACS recovery is also high: annual ACS recovery is between 1 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the first 10 year after logging ( Figure 6 ) , lower than in Amazonian secondary forests ( 3–5 Mg C ha-1 yr−1 in the first 20 year after abandonment of land use [Poorter et al . , 2016] ) . Recruits , for their part , have very low geographical variations in post-logging ACS changes: 10 years after the disturbance they are predicted to store similar amounts of ACS almost everywhere in Amazonia . Nevertheless , small trees with DBH <20 cm have not been accounted for in our study and may play an important role in post-logging ACS changes . The 10–20 cm DBH size class contains as much as 14% of total ACS and may be highly dynamic in some Amazonian forests ( Vieira et al . , 2004 ) . Because of the slow tree growth rates in Amazonia ( Vieira et al . , 2005; Herault et al . , 2010 ) , many trees will not reach the 20 cm DBH threshold 10 years after logging: the effects of the 10–20 cm DBH stratum on post-logging ACS changes are likely to be missed in sites with less than 10 years of measurements ( e . g . Peteco , Ecosilva , Iracema , Cumaru ) and should be studied , together with the natural regeneration , in the future . At the stand level , high disturbance intensities reduce survivors’ ACS: survivors’ ACS growth is consequently lower ( Figure 3a ) , resulting in lower net ACS change during the first 10 years of the recovery period ( Figure 3f ) . High disturbance intensities as well as relatively low forest maturity alleviate competition , and this is probably why ACS contributions from recruits remain high for longer ( Figure 2b ) in such enhanced growth conditions ( Herault et al . , 2010 ) . In the first years after logging , net ACS recovery depends little on disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) , but recovery is predicted to last longer in heavily logged forests . In immature forests , intense self-thinning ( Swaine et al . , 1987 ) may explain fast ACS losses from survivors’ mortality ( Figure 2d ) . In the tropics , reduced-impact logging techniques ( RIL; [Putz et al . , 2008] ) are promoted to reduce collateral damage to residual stands and biodiversity . Our results reveal that lower disturbance intensities , as a direct consequence of the employment of RIL techniques , could increase survivors’ ACS growth and slow down their ACS loss . Given that government specified minimum cutting cycles are short , e . g . 35 year in the Brazilian Amazon ( Blaser et al . , 2011 ) , and that many commercial species are slow-growing and dense-wooded ( Dauber et al . , 2005; Wright et al . , 2010 ) , available timber stocks for the next cutting cycle will be comprised mostly of survivors . Attention should be taken to high harvest intensities and/or substantial incidental damage due to poor harvesting practices that diminish stocks of survivors , even if they promote recruitment . Most trees that recruit are fast-growing pioneers that are favored by disturbance but are vulnerable to water stress ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) and competition ( Valladares and Niinemets , 2008 ) , and because their height is lower than in mature forests ( Rutishauser et al . , 2016 ) , they might have reduced carbon sequestration potential . With ongoing climate change and increased frequencies and intensities of droughts in Amazonia ( Malhi et al . , 2008 ) , betting on recruits to store C in forests disturbed by selective logging might thus be a risky gamble . In this study , we focus on one type of disturbance: selective logging . Because of its economic value and implications for forest management , selective logging is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests , and the data gathered by the TmFO network are unique in terms of experiment duration and spatial extent . We nevertheless believe that our study gives clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances ( e . g . droughts , fire ) that are expected to increase in frequency with ongoing global changes ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) .\nOur study includes data from thirteen long-term ( 8–30 year ) experimental forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Sites meet the following criteria: ( i ) located in tropical forests with mean annual precipitation above 1000 mm; ( ii ) a total censused area above 1 ha; ( iii ) at least one pre-logging census and ( iv ) at least two post-logging censuses . For each site , we extracted annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation data from WorldClim ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) , topsoil bulk density data from the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , and the synthetic climatic index from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) , using in all cases the highest resolution data available ( 30 arc-seconds ) . For one of our sites ( La Chonta , see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , field measurements of precipitation ( mean = 1580 mm yr-1 ) differed substantially from WorldClim data ( 1032 mm yr-1 ) : in this particular case we used the measured value and adjusted the synthetic climatic index ( E ) in the allometric equation ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) accordingly . Sites' data is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . In all plots , diameter at breast height ( DBH ) of trees >20 cm DBH were measured , and trees were identified to the lowest taxonomic level: to the species level ( 75% ) when possible , or to the genus level ( 15% ) ; 10% of trees were not identified . To get the wood density , we applied the following standardized protocol to all sites: ( i ) trees identified to the species level were assigned the corresponding wood specific gravity value from the Global Wood Density Database ( GWDD , doi:10 . 5061/dryad . 234/1 ) ( Zanne et al . , 2009 ) ; ( ii ) trees identified to the genus level were assigned a genus-average wood density; ( iii ) trees with no botanical identification or that were not in the GWDD were assigned the site-average wood density . The aboveground biomass ( AGB ) was estimated with the allometric equations from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Biomass was assumed to be 50% carbon ( Penman et al . , 2003 ) . The ACS of every tree i was then computed as follows: ( 1 ) ACSi^=exp ( −1 . 803−0 . 976×E+0 . 976×ln ( WDi ) ++2 . 673×ln ( DBHi ) −0 . 0299×ln ( DBHi2 ) ) ×0 . 5 where W⁢Di and D⁢B⁢Hi are the specific wood density and diameter at breast height of the tree i and E is the synthetic climatic index ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . The ACS changes data that was generated is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . After logging , plot ACS decreases rapidly until it reaches its minimum value ( a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢n ) a few years later . This transition point determines the beginning tm⁢i⁢n=t0 of the recovery period . a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢n was estimated as the minimum ACS in the 4 years following logging activities . Because our focus is on post-logging ACS recovery , we did not include in our analysis plots where the minimum ACS value was not reached within the 4 years after logging , either because the logging activity did not affect the plot or because there were other sources of disturbance long after logging ( fire , road opening , silvicultural treatments ) . For each plot j and census k , with tk the time since the beginning of the recovery period t0 , we define 5 ACS changes : new recruits’ ACS ( R⁢rj , k ) is the ACS of all trees <20 cm DBH at tk-1 and ≥20 cm DBH at tk; recruits’ ACS growth ( R⁢gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living recruits between tk-1 and tk ; recruits’ ACS loss ( R⁢lj , k ) is the C in recruits that die between tk-1 and tk; survivors’ ACS growth ( S⁢gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living survivors between tk-1 and tk; survivors’ ACS loss ( S⁢lj , k ) is the ACS of survivors that die between tk-1 and tk . ACS gains ( S⁢g , R⁢r , R⁢g ) are positive and ACS losses ( S⁢l , R⁢l ) are negative . Instantaneous ACS changes are subject to stochastic variation over time: because we are less interested in year-to-year variations than in long-term ACS trajectories , we modelled cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . Cumulative ACS changes ( Mg C ha-1 ) were defined as follows: ( 2 ) c⁢C⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢ej , k=∑m=0kC⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢ej , m where j is the plot , tk the time since t0 ( yr ) and C⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢e is the annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , either recruits’ ACS ( R⁢r ) , recruits’ ACS growth ( R⁢g ) , recruits’ ACS loss ( R⁢l ) , survivors’ ACS growth ( S⁢g ) , or survivors’ ACS loss ( S⁢l ) . To model ACS changes , we chose six covariates : ( 1 ) l⁢o⁢s⁢s disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a⁢c⁢s⁢0 mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d⁢a⁢c⁢s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a⁢c⁢s⁢0; ( 4 ) p⁢r⁢e⁢c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s⁢e⁢a⁢s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b⁢d topsoil bulk density . To give equivalent weight to all covariates , we centred and standardized them in order to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one over all observations . The uncertainty associated with ACS covariates ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s , a⁢c⁢s⁢0 , d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) is less than 10% ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Climatic covariates ( annual precipitation p⁢r⁢e⁢c and precipitation seasonality s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) were extracted from Worldclim rasters ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) . Error in Worldclim precipitation data was estimated to be <10 mm in Amazonia ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) . There is no information on the uncertainty on topsoil bulk density but we expect it to be higher than the uncertainty on other covariates , due to measurement ( De Vos et al . , 2005 ) and interpolation methods ( Hendriks et al . , 2016 ) . Survivors’ cumulative ACS changes are null at t=0 ( by definition ) . When all survivors are dead , their ACS changes stop: annual ACS changes become null and cumulative ACS changes reach a constant/finite limit . We decided to model survivors’ cumulative ACS growth c⁢S⁢g and ACS loss c⁢S⁢l as: ( 3 ) c⁢Si , j , k∼𝒩⁢ ( αjS× ( 1-e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -βjS×tk ) ) , ( σES ) 2 ) where j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 , S is either S⁢g or Sl . αjS is the finite limit of the cumulative ACS change and βjS the rate at which the cumulative ACS change converges to this limit . By choosing an exponential kernel , we assume that survivors’ ACS change at tk is proportional to survivors’ ACS change at tk-1 . Because αjS values are expected to vary among plots , they are modelled with the following distribution: ( 4 ) αjS∼𝒩⁢ ( α0S , ( σαS ) 2 ) Parameter βjS is the rate at which survivors’ ACS change ( from growth or mortality ) on plot j converges to a finite limit after the disturbance: it reflects the response rapidity of survivors’ ACS changes to disturbance . Because we are interested in predicting variations in βjS ( S is either S⁢g or S⁢l ) , we expressed βjS as a function of covariates: ( 5 ) βjS=β0S+∑l=16 ( λlS×Vj , l ) where ∑l=16 ( λlS×Vj , l ) , is the effect of covariates ( Vj , l ) on the post-logging rate βj . Covariates are centred and standardized and are ( 1 ) l⁢o⁢s⁢s : disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a⁢c⁢s⁢0 : mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d⁢a⁢c⁢s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a⁢c⁢s⁢0; ( 4 ) p⁢r⁢e⁢c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s⁢e⁢a⁢s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b⁢d topsoil bulk density . When all survivors in plot j are dead , all the C gained by their growth ( c⁢S⁢gj , ∞=αjS⁢g ) plus their initial ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj ) will have been lost ( c⁢S⁢lj , ∞=αjS⁢l ) . We thus added the following constraint to each plot j: ( 6 ) αjS⁢l+αjS⁢g+a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj=0 with αjS⁢g , αjS⁢l the finite limits of survivors’ cumulative ACS growth and ACS loss respectively , and a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj the ACS of the plot j at tm⁢i⁢n=t0 . When survivors are all dead , recruits will constitute the new forest . We made the assumption that the ACS of this new forest will reach a dynamic equilibrium: recruits’ annual ACS changes are expected to converge to constant values ( that are however prone to small inter-annual variations ) , with ACS gains compensating ACS losses . Because there are no recruits yet at t0 , recruits’ annual ACS growth ( R⁢g ) and ACS loss ( R⁢l ) are zero , and progressively increase to reach their asymptotic values . Recruits’ annual ACS growth and ACS loss can be thus modelled with the function: ( 7 ) f⁢ ( t;α , β ) =α× ( 1-e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -β×t ) ) where t is the time since the beginning of the recovery period . In the same logic as survivors’ cumulative ACS change , α is the asymptotic value of recruits’ annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , and β is the rate at which this asymptotic value is reached . Contrary to recruits’ annual ACS growth and ACS loss , the ACS of new recruits ( R⁢r ) is high at t0 because of the competition drop induced by logging , but then progressively decreases to reach its asymptotic value . We modelled it with the following function: ( 8 ) f⁢ ( t;α , β , η ) =α× ( 1+η×e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -β×t ) ) where t is the time since logging . The parameter η was added to allow annual recruited ACS to be higher than α at t0 . As stated before , we chose to model cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . The general model for recruits’ cumulative ACS changes is deduced by integrating annual ACS changes from t0 to tk: ( 9 ) cRi , j , k∼𝒩 ( αiR× ( tk+η×1−exp ( −βjR×tk ) βjR ) , ( σER ) 2 ) where i is the site , j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 R is either Rr , Rg or R⁢l . When R is R⁢g or R⁢l , η=-1; when R is R⁢r , η>0 . Once the forest reaches a new dynamic equilibrium , recruits’ annual ACS changes should depend mostly on each site’s characteristics: we expect there to be more inter-site than intra-site variation in recruits’ asymptotic ACS changes αR . This is why we use one value αiR per site i , and model it as follows: ( 10 ) αiR∼𝒩⁢ ( α0R; ( σαR ) 2 ) When the dynamic equilibrium is reached , annual ACS gain ( growth and recruitment ) compensates annual ACS loss ( mortality ) . We thus added the following constraint for every site i: ( 11 ) αiR⁢r+αiR⁢g+αiR⁢l=0 With the same logic as for survivors , we are interested in predicting variation in βR . Given that we use one value αiR per site i ( i . e . all plots in one site i have the same value for αiR ) , we chose to take into account the inter-plot variability as follows: ( 12 ) βjR∼𝒩⁢ ( β0R+∑l=16 ( λlR×Vj , l ) ⁢ , ⁢ ( σβR ) 2 ) Bayesian hierarchical models were inferred through MCMC methods using an adaptive form of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . Each observation was given a weight proportional to the size of the plot . Codes were developed using the R language ( RRID:SCR_001905 ) ( R Developement Core Team , 2015 ) and the Rstan package ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . A detailed list of priors is provided in Table 1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 012Table 1 . List of priors used to infer ACS changes in a Bayesian framework .

Maps were obtained with the following steps: ( i ) spatially-explicit covariates are extracted at the resolution of 30 arc-second from: the pan-tropical carbon map of Avitabile et al . for pre-disturbance aboveground carbon stocks ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) ; WorldClim ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) for annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation , and the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) for topsoil bulk density; ( ii ) disturbance intensity is set to 40% of pre-logging ACS loss , which is a common value for disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( West et al . , 2014; Blanc et al . , 2009; Martin et al . , 2015 ) , and the relative forest maturity d⁢a⁢c⁢s is set to zero; ( iii ) parameters are drawn from their previously calibrated distribution; ( iv ) to simulate random effects , all five parameters ( α ) are taken from their distribution 𝒩⁢ ( α0 , σα2 ) ; ( v ) for every pixel , we estimate the five cumulative ACS changes ( c⁢S⁢g , c⁢S⁢l , c⁢R⁢r , c⁢R⁢g , c⁢R⁢l ) 10 years after the 40% ACS loss , given the parameters value and the pixel covariates values extracted from global rasters . Steps ( iii ) to ( v ) are repeated 200 times and summary statistics are calculated for every pixel . Because a significant part of our sites have experiment duration lower than 10 years ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , we are less confident in Amazonian-wide predictions after that 10 year period . Maps were elaborated under the R statistical software ( RRID:SCR_001905 ) ( R Developement Core Team , 2015 ) .",
         "The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest tropical forest in the world . Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife , rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon , which is a core component of all life on Earth . Certain forms of carbon , such as the gas carbon dioxide , contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests . Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules . The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems . Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest . This “selective logging” results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest , but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow . New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees . However , it is not clear how differences in the forest ( for example , forest maturity ) , environmental factors ( such as climate or soil ) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon . Piponiot et al . used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest . The models show that the forest’s ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions . For example , the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable . The findings of Piponiot et al . highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery . The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest .",

         "Neurosphere formation is commonly used as a surrogate for neural stem cell ( NSC ) function but the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells ( NICs ) and NSCs remains unclear . We prospectively identified , and isolated by flow cytometry , adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− ( GEPCOT ) cells . They were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo based on fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2 . In contrast , pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent , expressed higher Glast , and lower EGFR and PlexinB2 . Pre-GEPCOT cells could not form neurospheres but expressed the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT , GFAP-CreERT2 , Sox2CreERT2 , and Gli1CreERT2 and were long-lived in vivo . While GEPCOT NICs were ablated by temozolomide , pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ . Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells , though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression . Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo .\nNeural stem cells ( NSCs ) reside in two regions of the adult mammalian forebrain: the subgranular zone in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone in the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle ( SVZ ) . SVZ NSCs persist throughout adult life ( Maslov et al . , 2004; Molofsky et al . , 2006; Imayoshi et al . , 2008 ) , giving rise primarily to neurons in the olfactory bulb as well as some astrocytes in the olfactory bulb ( Lois and Alvarez-Buylla , 1994; Lois et al . , 1996; Doetsch et al . , 1999b; Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Kuo et al . , 2006; Lagace et al . , 2007; Merkle et al . , 2007; Imayoshi et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2009 ) and oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum and cortex ( Nait-Oumesmar et al . , 1999; Menn et al . , 2006 ) . In vivo , these NSCs are quiescent ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) , resistant to anti-mitotic agents ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; Giachino and Taylor , 2009 ) , long-lived ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Imayoshi et al . , 2008 ) , and capable of regenerating the SVZ after injury ( Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; López-Juárez et al . , 2013 ) . Clonal colony-forming assays have been widely used to study neural stem/progenitor cells that give rise to neurons , astrocytes , and oligodendrocytes in adherent cultures ( Davis and Temple , 1994 ) and non-adherent neurosphere cultures ( Reynolds and Weiss , 1992 ) . However , in the adult forebrain it remains uncertain whether these colonies are formed by quiescent neural stem cells ( qNSCs ) or by mitotically active and shorter-lived multipotent progenitors ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 2002; Reynolds and Rietze , 2005; Pastrana et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) . Moreover , reliance upon retrospective colony-formation assays makes it impossible to directly study qNSCs or NICs as they exist in vivo . Pioneering work by Alvarez-Buylla and colleagues has demonstrated the existence of a lineage of NSCs and transit amplifying cells in the SVZ that gives rise to neuronal progenitors throughout life ( Lois and Alvarez-Buylla , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Ihrie and Alvarez-Buylla , 2011 ) . By electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis they identified GFAP-expressing type B cells that appear to be the qNSCs . These cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents such as AraC and appear capable of repopulating the SVZ after AraC treatment ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a , 1999b , 2002 ) . Type B cells are thought to give rise to Ascl1- and Dlx2-expressing type C cells , which are mitotically active and ablated by anti-mitotic agents ( Morshead et al . , 1994; Doetsch et al . , 1999b , 2002; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . The type C cells give rise to Dcx- and PSA-NCAM-expressing type A neuronal progenitors . These studies have provided a critical framework for understanding the SVZ neurogenic lineage , though the inability to purify live cells from each stage of this hierarchy has hampered efforts to assess their properties . The inability to prospectively identify and isolate uncultured stem cells from the central nervous system ( CNS ) has contributed to uncertainty regarding the relationship between qNSCs and NICs . SVZ NICs have been enriched by flow cytometry based on CD15 expression ( Capela and Temple , 2002 ) or ROS levels ( Le Belle et al . , 2011 ) . Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that NSCs express GFAP and that these cells sustainably contribute to neurogenesis in vivo ( Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a , 1999b , 2002; Imura et al . , 2003; Morshead et al . , 2003; Garcia et al . , 2004; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Pastrana et al . , 2009; Beckervordersandforth et al . , 2010; Giachino et al . , 2013 ) . Pastrana et al . identified quiescent GFAP-GFP+EGFR− SVZ cells and speculated that these cells include NSCs that give rise to more mitotically active GFAP-GFP+EGFR+ and GFAP-GFP-EGFR+ NICs but did not test this by fate-mapping ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , it has been suggested that nearly all GFAP-GFP+CD133+ cells are NICs and that these cells are the qNSCs in the SVZ ( Beckervordersandforth et al . , 2010 ) . Efforts toward prospective identification have therefore generated conflicting results about whether NICs are quiescent or mitotically active in vivo and regarding their relationship to NSCs . We have identified regulators of CNS stem cell self-renewal based on their ability to regulate SVZ proliferation and neurogenesis in vivo as well as multipotent NIC self-renewal in culture ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2006; Nishino et al . , 2008; Chuikov et al . , 2010 ) . However , an important question that we have not been able to address directly is whether those genes are necessary for NSC maintenance in vivo . Impaired NIC self-renewal in culture may not reflect reduced NSC self-renewal in vivo ( Joseph and Morrison , 2005; He et al . , 2009 ) . For example , the polycomb transcriptional repressor Bmi-1 is thought to be required for NSC self-renewal ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Zencak et al . , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . However , these studies were performed in germline knockout mice that generally die within a month after birth ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Jacobs et al . , 1999; Lessard and Sauvageau , 2003; Park et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , it has not been possible to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by NSCs in the adult brain or whether NSCs differ from NICs in their dependence upon Bmi-1 . Here we report the prospective identification of two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of cells in the SVZ: GEPCOT cells and pre-GEPCOT cells . The pre-GEPCOTs accounted for 6 ± 3% of adult mouse SVZ cells , were highly quiescent , lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture , and included type B1 cells based on marker expression , morphology , and position in vivo . These cells contained long-lived qNSCs based on both fate mapping and temozolomide resistance . GEPCOTs were distinguished by lower GFAP and Glast expression and higher EGFR and PlexinB2 expression . These cells accounted for 3 . 2 ± 0 . 7% of cells in the adult mouse SVZ , were highly mitotically active , highly enriched for NICs , and included type C cells based on marker expression , morphology , and position in vivo . Based on fate-mapping these cells were short-lived in the SVZ . Our data thus provide methods to prospectively identify and distinguish qNSCs from NICs .\nWe enzymatically dissociated adult mouse SVZ cells then sorted cells by flow cytometry into non-adherent cultures at clonal density ( 0 . 66 cells/µl of culture medium ) . We always replated neurospheres to adherent secondary cultures to assess differentiation into TuJ1+ neurons , GFAP+ astrocytes , and O4+ oligodendrocytes . On average , 1 . 8 ± 0 . 4% of SVZ cells formed neurospheres ( >50 µm diameter ) and 75% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( 1 . 4 ± 0 . 3% of SVZ cells ) . We systematically screened 383 antibodies against 330 distinct cell surface antigens ( Supplementary file 1A ) to identify markers that could enrich NICs ( Figure 1A ) . We identified 49 markers by flow cytometry that were heterogeneously expressed among dissociated SVZ cells . For each of these markers we sorted SVZ cells that differed in their level of staining into non-adherent cultures and assessed neurosphere formation . We found 17 markers that enriched NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells ( Supplementary file 1A ) . We multiplexed combinations of these markers to optimize enrichment while ensuring that most NICs were retained within the sorted population . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 003Figure 1 . Prospective identification and isolation of neurosphere-initiating cells . ( A ) A screen of antibodies identified cell surface markers of NICs in the adult mouse SVZ .

Isolating GEPCOT cells by flow cytometry . ( A ) Side scatter ( SSC ) and forward scatter ( FSC ) were gated to eliminate debris . The parameters of this gate can be set using mouse bone marrow as shown in the first panel such that myeloid cells fall in the center of the plot . FSC threshold was increased to eliminate as much debris as possible without eliminating cells ( this can be checked by sorting events onto a microscope slide and then checking by microscopy to determine whether the events include cells or debris ) . These steps ensure reproducibility across days in spite of extensive debris in SVZ cell preparations . Sucrose density centrifugation ( approximately 90% debris reduction ) or myelin depletion using paramagnetic myelin-binding microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , 130-096-733 , approximately ∼95–98% debris reduction ) greatly reduce debris but also reduce cell yield by ∼50–60% . ( B ) The sixth gate ( CD24/Glast ) is drawn using the ‘live SVZ cells’ population as a guide . On a plot of Glast vs CD24 , live SVZ cells should have two clearly resolved populations that are either CD24mid or CD24−/low . The CD24 gate excludes all the CD24mid cells and retains all the CD24−/low cells . ( C ) Most NICs and multipotent NICs were contained in the GEPCOT population , which was 20-fold enriched for NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . The remaining non-GEPCOT cells were threefold depleted for NICs relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . Data represent mean ± SD from 11 ( neurospheres >50 μm ) or 5 ( multipotent neurospheres ) independent experiments . Significance was assessed using two-tailed t tests ( ** , p<0 . 01; *** , p<0 . 001 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 004 We greatly enriched NICs by isolating live ( 4′ , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) negative ) SVZ cells that expressed moderate levels of Glast , high levels of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , high levels of PlexinB2 , negative to low levels of CD24 , negative to low levels of O4 and PSA-NCAM , and were negative for the hematopoietic markers Ter119 and CD45 . We refer to these GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− cells as GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , B ) . GEPCOTs accounted for 3 . 2 ± 0 . 7% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 1B ) . On average , 36 ± 6% of GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( >50 µm diameter ) and 74% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 1C ) . Nearly all of the neurospheres ( 91% ) could be passaged ( data not shown ) . On average , each neurosphere gave rise to 53 ± 41 multipotent secondary neurospheres upon dissociation and replating , demonstrating self-renewal potential . Most NICs from the SVZ were contained within this GEPCOT population ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Given that individual NICs are unlikely to form colonies with 100% efficiency after dissociation and flow cytometry , most GEPCOT cells likely have the potential to form neurospheres . The ability to prospectively identify NICs made it possible to assess their cell cycle distribution in vivo by administering bromodeoxyuridine ( BrdU ) to mice . After just a 2 hour pulse of BrdU , 35 ± 2% of GEPCOTs were already BrdU+ as compared to only 11 ± 4% of unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 1D ) . Longer pulses of BrdU progressively increased the labeling of the GEPCOT cells . After a 24-hr pulse of BrdU , 89 ± 4% of GEPCOTs were BrdU+ as compared to 47 ± 9% of unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 1D ) . GEPCOTs are thus highly mitotically active and enriched for dividing cells relative to unfractionated SVZ cells . The observation that nearly all GEPCOTs incorporated BrdU within 24 hr indicates that few , if any , GEPCOTs are quiescent and that NICs are highly proliferative in vivo . To assess the persistence of NICs in vivo we performed a series of lineage tracing experiments . Guided by previous observations ( Doetsch et al . , 2002; Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Arnold et al . , 2011; Kim et al . , 2011; Taniguchi et al . , 2011; Lee et al . , 2012; Wang et al . , 2012 ) we screened candidate CreERT2 alleles for the ability to recombine a conditional Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato reporter within NICs in vivo after 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen injection ( Figure 2A; 80 mg/kg body mass/day i . p . ) . We found that Dlx1CreERT2 ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Ascl1CreERT2 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005 ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , and Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) labeled 11–94% of NICs 2 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2B–F ) . With each Cre allele and at earch time point , the frequency of tdTomato+ GEPCOTs was statistically indistinguishable from the frequency of tdTomato+ neurospheres that arose in culture from unfractionated SVZ cells ( Figure 2B–F ) . This independently confirms that GEPCOT markers reliably identify uncultured cells with the ability to form neurospheres . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 005Figure 2 . Individual NICs persist only transiently within the SVZ in vivo but are constantly replenished by more primitive neural stem cells . ( A ) Mice bearing inducible Cre alleles and the Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato conditional reporter were induced with 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen injections ( 80 mg/kg/day ) then chased for 2 to 60 days before analysis of the percentage of labeled SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells in vivo or the percentage of labeled neurospheres ( >50 µm ) in culture . ( B–F ) Cells marked by recombination of Dlx1CreERT2 ( B , n = 4–7 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) , Ascl1CreERT2 ( C , n = 3 or 4 mice/time point in three independent experiments ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( D ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( E ) , or Sox2CreERT2 ( F , n = 3–4 mice/time point in four independent experiments for D–F ) . ( G ) A model consistent with the fate mapping data involving a NSC population that gives rise to a transient NIC population . Data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance was tested among sequential days of analysis ( 7d was compared to 2d , 28d was compared to 7d , and 60d was compared to 28d ) with a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons , *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 005 To assess the persistence of NICs in vivo we quantified the frequencies of all SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and neurospheres that were tdTomato+ at 2 , 7 , 28 , or 60 days after tamoxifen treatment . In the absence of tamoxifen we detected no tdTomato expression in SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , or cultured neurospheres in Dlx1CreERT2 mice ( Figure 2B ) . 2 days after tamoxifen treatment , Dlx1CreERT2 labeled 51 ± 6% of SVZ cells , 15 ± 6% of GEPCOTs , and 11 ± 4% of neurospheres ( Figure 2B ) . 7 days after tamoxifen this significantly ( p<0 . 001 ) declined to 8 ± 5% of SVZ cells , 0 . 7 ± 0 . 9% of GEPCOTs , and 0 . 9 ± 1% of neurospheres ( Figure 2B ) . 28 days after tamoxifen only rare SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and neurospheres were labeled ( Figure 2B ) . Dlx1CreERT2-expressing NICs thus persist in vivo for less than 7 days . Ascl1CreERT2 labeled most GEPCOTs and neurospheres . In the absence of tamoxifen , only 0 . 02% of SVZ cells , and no GEPCOTs or neurospheres , were tdTomato+ ( Figure 2C ) . 2 days after tamoxifen , Ascl1CreERT2 labeled 34 ± 7% of SVZ cells , 63 ± 8% of GEPCOTs , and 64 ± 6% of neurospheres ( Figure 2C ) . 7 days after tamoxifen a similar fraction of SVZ cells remained tdTomato+ ( 35 ± 3% ) but the fraction of labeled GEPCOTs and neurospheres significantly ( p<0 . 01 ) declined to 40 ± 4% and 45 ± 3% , respectively ( Figure 2C ) . 28 days after tamoxifen only 16 ± 0 . 9% of SVZ cells , 16 ± 0 . 6% of GEPCOTs , and 19 ± 1 . 0% of neurospheres were labeled . This further decreased to 7 . 5 ± 1 . 2% of SVZ cells , 12 ± 0 . 8% of GEPCOTs , and 8 ± 3% of neurospheres at 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2C ) . This demonstrates that most Ascl1CreERT2-expressing NICs persist in vivo for less than 28 days . In contrast to cells labeled with Dlx1CreERT2 or Ascl1CreERT2 , cells labeled with Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , or Sox2CreERT2 exhibited a sustained contribution to the pools of SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and NICs for at least 60 days after tamoxifen administration ( Figure 2D–F ) . This suggested the existence of a long-lived NSC population in the SVZ that replenishes NICs and is marked by Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 expression ( Figure 2G ) . To test whether there is an earlier stem cell population in the SVZ we sought a CreERT2 allele that recombines in long-lived NSCs but not in NICs . Since prior studies have implicated GFAP as a marker of type B cells and NSCs in the adult SVZ ( Doetsch et al . , 1997 , 1999a , 2002; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Giachino and Taylor , 2009; Giachino et al . , 2013 ) we performed lineage-tracing experiments with GFAP-CreERT2 ( Hirrlinger et al . , 2006 ) . In the absence of tamoxifen , only 0 . 02% of SVZ cells , and no GEPCOTs or neurospheres , were tdTomato+ ( Figure 3A ) . 2 days after tamoxifen treatment , GFAP-CreERT2 labeled only 5 ± 0 . 6% of SVZ cells , 7 ± 2% of GEPCOTs , and 8 ± 0 . 9% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . 7 days after tamoxifen this increased significantly ( p<0 . 05 ) to 11 ± 4 . 3% of SVZ cells , 19 ± 5 . 5% of GEPCOTs , and 18 ± 6 . 1% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . By 28 days after tamoxifen this further increased to 26 ± 3 . 7% of SVZ cells , 32 ± 4 . 7% of GEPCOTs , and 35 ± 7 . 2% of neurospheres ( Figure 3A ) . At 60 days after tamoxifen we observed 23 ± 2 . 6% of SVZ cells , 34 ± 8 . 0% of GEPCOTs , and 37 ± 4 . 2% of neurospheres labeled ( Figure 3A ) . GFAP-CreERT2-expressing NSCs thus make a sustained and growing contribution to the SVZ , in contrast to NICs labeled by Dlx1CreERT2 or Ascl1CreERT2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 006Figure 3 . Identification of a pre-GEPCOT population that gives rise to GEPCOT NICs in vivo . ( A ) GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice were induced with tamoxifen for 5 days , chased for 2 to 60 days without tamoxifen , then conditional reporter expression was analyzed in all SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and cultured neurospheres ( n = 3–5 mice/time point in four independent experiments ) . ( B–D ) GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice were analyzed by flow cytometry to quantify reporter expression in SVZ cells without tamoxifen ( B ) , at 2 days ( C ) or 28 days ( D ) after tamoxifen treatment . ( B ) Without tamoxifen , virtually no SVZ cells expressed the reporter . For comparison to C and D , control SVZ cells are shown stained for Glast and EGFR as well as the distribution of the GlasthighEGFR−/low fraction with respect to PlexinB2 and O4/PSA-NCAM staining . ( C ) 2 days after tamoxifen , the tdTomato+ cells labeled by recombination by the GFAP-CreERT2 stem cell marker were GlasthighEgfr−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/Cd45− ( CD24 expression is not shown here ) , which we describe as ‘pre-GEPCOT’ cells . ( D ) By 28 days after tamoxifen , GlastmidEgfrhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− GEPCOT cells were also labeled .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 006 To better characterize the GFAP-CreERT2-expressing SVZ cells we examined the surface markers expressed by tdTomato+ cells 2 days after tamoxifen treatment of GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice . By flow cytometry , tdTomato+ cells were highly enriched for GlasthighEGFR−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− ( pre-GEPCOT ) cells ( Figure 3B–D ) . These cells differed from GEPCOT cells in that they exhibited higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2 expression . pre-GEPCOT cells made up only 6 ± 3% of all SVZ cells ( Figure 3E ) and yet , based on GFAP-CreERT2 lineage tracing , gave rise to many SVZ cells , GEPCOTs , and NICs within 28 days of tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 3A ) . The GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOTs therefore included NSCs with a much greater capacity to contribute to the SVZ than Ascl1CreERT2-expressing NICs . To confirm this we sorted pre-GEPCOT cells to test whether they stain with an anti-GFAP antibody . GFAP expression was heterogeneous within the pre-GEPCOT population , with 21 ± 7% being GFAPhigh and 33 ± 2% being GFAPlow ( Figure 4A ) . This suggests that the pre-GEPCOT population is much more highly enriched for NSCs as compared to unfractionated SVZ cells , which contained only 2 ± 1% GFAPhigh cells and 6 ± 3% GFAPlow cells ( both p<0 . 01 relative to pre-GEPCOT cells; Figure 4A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 007Figure 4 . GFAP-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent in vivo but make an enduring contribution to the SVZ .

( D–H ) Conditional reporter expression in pre-GEPCOT cells at varying times after recombination with the indicated Cre alleles . These data are from the same fate-mapping experiments as shown in Figures 2 and 3 , including the same SVZ data for comparison purposes . Cre alleles that only transiently contributed to the SVZ ( Dlx1CreERT2 and Ascl1CreERT2 ) did not recombine in pre-GEPCOT cells , while Cre alleles that gave enduring contributions to the SVZ ( Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 ) did recombine in pre-GEPCOT cells .

( K ) Markers that distinguish pre-GEPCOT from GEPCOT cells . ( L–M ) Whole-mount SVZs were stained with anti-acetylated tubulin ( red ) , anti-β-catenin ( blue ) , and either anti-GFAP ( L , green ) or anti-EGFR ( M , green ) antibodies and pinwheel structures were inspected for the presence of GFAPhigh pre-GEPCOT cells ( open arrow in L and M ) and EGFRhigh GEPCOT cells ( hatched arrow in M ) by confocal microscopy . Images were taken at the apical surface except the GFAP depth projection which is a composite of 11 images at 2 μm intervals into the tissue . Scale bar = 5 μm . All data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance of differences between SVZ and pre-GEPCOT cells in C was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests . Statistical significance of differences in D–J ( among time points ) was tested with a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 007 Whereas GEPCOTs were highly enriched for multipotent NICs ( Figure 1C ) , pre-GEPCOTs were unable to form neurospheres . We sorted unfractionated SVZ cells into culture and found that 1 . 9 ± 0 . 5% of the cells formed neurospheres and 2 . 0 ± 0 . 4% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . Under the same conditions 32 ± 7% of GEPCOTs formed neurospheres and 38 ± 13% formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . In contrast , only very rare pre-GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres ( 1/1663 cells ) and only 0 . 3 ± 0 . 4% ( 9/1973 cells ) formed adherent colonies ( Figure 4B ) . To assess whether pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent or frequently dividing in vivo , we administered pulses of BrdU . Although 47 ± 9% of SVZ cells and 89 ± 4% of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1D ) incorporated a 24-hr pulse of BrdU in these experiments , only 3 ± 3% of pre-GEPCOT cells incorporated BrdU in the same mice ( Figure 4C ) . Similarly , 60 ± 6% of SVZ cells and 91 ± 3% of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 1D ) incorporated a 2-week pulse of BrdU in these experiments , but only 4 ± 2% of pre-GEPCOT cells incorporated BrdU ( Figure 4C ) . These data indicate that pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent in the SVZ . To assess whether fate-mapping with CreERT2 alleles is consistent with the existence of a pre-GEPCOT qNSC population we assessed whether they recombined in pre-GEPCOT cells . Dlx1CreERT2 , which labeled 51 ± 6% of all SVZ cells and 15 ± 6% of GEPCOTs at 2 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 2B ) , did not label any pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 , 7 , or 28 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4D ) . Ascl1CreERT2 , which labeled 34 ± 7% of all SVZ cells and 63 ± 8% of GEPCOTs at 2 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2C ) , labeled fewer than 1% of pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 , 7 , 28 , and 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4E ) . Thus , both of the CreERT2 alleles that exhibited declining contributions to the SVZ upon fate-mapping labeled GEPCOTs but not pre-GEPCOTs . Neither the Dlx1CreERT2-expressing GEPCOT NICs nor the Ascl1CreERT2-expressing GEPCOT NICs gave rise to significant numbers of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs in vivo , at least under steady-state conditions . To assess whether pre-GEPCOTs contain qNSCs we tested whether the CreERT2 alleles that sustainably contributed to the SVZ over time ( Gli1CreERT2 , Slc1a3-CreERT , and Sox2CreERT2 ) labeled pre-GEPCOT cells . Gli1CreERT2 , which sustainably labeled 8–19% of all SVZ cells and 26–40% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 2D ) , also sustainably labeled 7–13% of pre-GEPCOT cells at 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 4F ) . Slc1a3-CreERT , which sustainably labeled 21–48% of all SVZ cells and 61–72% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2E ) , also labeled 31–36% of pre-GEPCOT cells 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4G ) . Sox2CreERT2 , which sustainably labeled 49–65% of all SVZ cells and 92–97% of GEPCOTs for 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 2F ) , also sustainably labeled 87–93% of pre-GEPCOT cells 2 to 60 days after tamoxifen ( Figure 4H ) . Thus all of the CreERT2 alleles that gave a sustained contribution to NIC and SVZ labeling also labeled pre-GEPCOTs , consistent with the suggestion that pre-GEPCOT cells contain qNSCs . Moreover , every CreERT2 allele that labeled pre-GEPCOT cells exhibited sustained labeling of not only pre-GEPCOT cells but also GEPCOTs , NICs , and unfractionated SVZ cells . We tested whether the GFAP-CreERT2 recombination pattern was consistent with pre-GEPCOT qNSCs giving rise to GEPCOT NICs in vivo . 2 days after tamoxifen administration to GFAP-CreERT2; Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato mice , the tdTomato label was present mainly in pre-GEPCOT cells . On average , 29 ± 7% of pre-GEPCOT cells were tdTomato+ whereas only 6 . 7 ± 1 . 9% of GEPCOT cells , 2 . 2 ± 0 . 5% of PSA-NCAMhighCD24mid neuroblasts ( Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) , and 3 . 0 ± 0 . 8% of other SVZ cells were labeled ( Figure 4I ) . These data indicate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombines efficiently in pre-GEPCOTs but not GEPCOT NICs in vivo . 28 days after tamoxifen treatment , the percentage of labeled pre-GEPCOT cells increased to 44 ± 5 . 8% of cells ( Figure 4I ) . The percentages of labeled GEPCOTs , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells also increased significantly ( p<0 . 01 ) by 28 days–32 ± 4 . 7% , 35 ± 6 . 8% , and 20 ± 2 . 2% , respectively . At 60 days after tamoxifen , we continued to observe strong labeling in pre-GEPCOTs , GEPCOTs , and neuroblasts ( Figure 4I ) . Similar trends were apparent when the data were expressed in absolute numbers ( Figure 4J ) . These data suggest GFAP-CreERT2-expressing pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs that give rise to NICs , neuroblasts , and other SVZ cells ( Figure 4K ) . We examined the localization of pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells in whole mount stains of the SVZ . pre-GEPCOTs were distinguished by GFAP expression , a marker of type B cells ( Doetsch et al . , 1999a ) and GEPCOTs were distinguished by EGFR expression , a marker of type C cells ( Doetsch et al . , 2002 ) . We stained whole-mount SVZs with antibodies against acetylated tubulin and β-catenin to detect ‘pinwheel’ structures associated with type B1 stem cells in the SVZ ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2008 ) then also stained with antibodies against GFAP and EGFR . Consistent with prior results ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2008 ) , we observed GFAPhigh cells at the center of the pinwheel structures with a single primary cilium on the apical surface contacting the ventricle and a long basal process ( Figure 4L ) . Since many pre-GEPCOTs recombined with GFAP-CreERT2 but virtually no GEPCOTs did ( Figure 4I ) , these data indicate that many pre-GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type B1 cells in the SVZ . In contrast , EGFRhigh cells had type C cell morphology: round , unciliated , and generally not contacting the ventricle , consistent with Doetsch et al . ( 2002 ) ( Figure 4M ) . Since all GEPCOT cells express high levels of EGFR ( Figure 1B ) while pre-GEPCOT cells have low levels of EGFR ( Figure 3D ) , these data suggest that many GEPCOT cells have the morphology and position of type C cells . Our observation that pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs raised the question of whether pre-GEPCOT cells are resistant to anti-mitotic agents . To test this , we treated mice for 3 consecutive days with the CNS-penetrating DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide ( TMZ; 100 mg/kg/day i . p . ) ( Garthe et al . , 2009 ) then assessed SVZ proliferation , composition , and neurosphere formation 3 to 90 days later ( Figure 5A ) . 3 days after TMZ , mice appeared healthy and had lost less than 3% of their body mass as compared to before TMZ treatment ( data not shown ) . 3 days after TMZ treatment we observed a 23% reduction in the total number of cells per SVZ and this reduction remained nearly constant over the next 90 days ( Figure 5B ) . 3 days after TMZ we observed an 80% reduction in the number of dividing SVZ cells , based on BrdU incorporation ( Figure 5C , p<0 . 001 ) . The number of dividing SVZ cells slowly increased over time , recovering to 50% of normal by 90 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5C ) . 3 days after TMZ only 0 . 7% of the NICs observed in saline-treated control mice remained in TMZ-treated mice ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . By 16 days after TMZ treatment NICs recovered to 20% of normal levels ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . The numbers of NICs continued to increase over time , recovering to 55% of normal by 90 days after TMZ ( Figure 5D , p<0 . 001 ) . NICs are thus virtually completely eliminated by TMZ but regenerate over time as expected . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 008Figure 5 . Treatment with temozolomide does not affect the frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells but ablates GEPCOT NICs . ( A–F ) Mice were injected with TMZ ( 100 mg/kg/day ) for three consecutive days to ablate dividing cells , then allowed to recover for 3 to 90 days before analysis ( TMZ 1x ) . All TMZ 1x data reflect 5–7 mice per time point from seven independent experiments . ( G–L ) Alternatively , mice were serially treated with two doses of TMZ 12 days apart then allowed to recover for 3 to 90 days before analysis ( TMZ 2x ) . All TMZ 2x data reflect 4–9 mice per time point from six independent experiments . At each time point after TMZ treatment the panels show the total number of cells isolated per SVZ ( B and H ) , the number of SVZ cells per section that incorporated a 2 hr pulse of BrdU ( C and I ) , the number of multipotent neurospheres that arose in culture per SVZ ( D and J ) , the number of GEPCOTs per SVZ ( E and K ) , and the number of pre-GEPCOTs per SVZ ( F and L ) . ( M–P ) Mice were injected with tamoxifen ( 80 mg/kg/day i . p . ) for 5 days , then with TMZ ( 100 mg/kg/day i . p . ) for 3 days , then recovered for 3 or 35 days to observe regeneration . The numbers of labeled GEPCOTs were measured after recombination with Ascl1CreERT2 ( N , 4 mice per condition from two independent experiments ) , Slc1a3-CreERT ( O , 5–6 mice per condition from three independent experiments ) , or GFAP-CreERT2 ( P , 4 mice per condition from two independent experiments ) . All data represent mean ± SD . Statistical significance was tested with a one-way ANOVA followed by Sidak's post-hoc test for the indicated comparisons in B–F and H–L . Statistical significance in N–P was assessed with two-tailed student's t tests . *p<0 . 05 , **p<0 . 01 , ***p<0 . 001 , n . s . not significant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 008 Consistent with the effects of TMZ on NICs , TMZ treatment also eliminated nearly all GEPCOT cells . 3 days after TMZ treatment , only 10% of the GEPCOTs observed in saline-treated control mice remained in TMZ treated mice ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . By 16 days after TMZ treatment , GEPCOTs recovered to 32% of normal levels ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . GEPCOTs recovered to 55% of normal levels by 90 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5E , p<0 . 001 ) . The numbers of pre-GEPCOT cells in the SVZ were not affected by TMZ treatment ( Figure 5F ) . If pre-GEPCOT qNSCs regenerate NICs after TMZ treatment then serial TMZ treatment might be expected to deplete pre-GEPCOT cells . To test this we administered two rounds of TMZ 12 days apart ( Figure 5G ) . Under these circumstances , pre-GEPCOT cells were not depleted 3 days after the second round of TMZ treatment but they were depleted by 90 days after the second round of TMZ ( Figure 5L ) . Consistent with the observation that pre-GEPCOT cells were sensitive to serial TMZ treatment , we detected little recovery of dividing SVZ cells ( Figure 5I ) , NICs ( Figure 5J ) , or GEPCOTs ( Figure 5K ) after serial TMZ treatment . These data suggest that GEPCOT NICs are replenished after ablation by pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . To directly test whether GEPCOTs arise from pre-GEPCOT cells during SVZ regeneration we performed lineage tracing using multiple Cre alleles by first labeling cells with tamoxifen and then treating with TMZ ( Figure 5M ) . After recombination of a conditional reporter with the GEPCOT marker Ascl1CreERT2 , the number of unlabeled GEPCOTs per SVZ increased from 120 ± 50 at 3 days after TMZ to 640 ± 210 at 35 days after TMZ ( p<0 . 01 ) but Ascl1CreERT2-labeled GEPCOTs did not significantly change ( Figure 5N ) . The GEPCOTs , NICs , and neuroblasts that regenerated after TMZ treatment thus did not arise from Ascl1CreERT2-labeled GEPCOTs ( Figure 5N ) . In contrast , after recombination of a conditional reporter with the pre-GEPCOT markers Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 we observed significant ( p<0 . 05 ) increases in the frequencies of labeled GEPCOT cells , NICs , and neuroblasts between 3 and 35 days after TMZ treatment ( Figure 5O , P ) . These results strongly suggest that pre-GEPCOT cells give rise to GEPCOTs , NICs , and neuroblasts during SVZ regeneration . pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs expressed similar levels of Bmi-1 by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6A ) . To study the molecular mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs in vivo we generated a floxed allele of Bmi-1 ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A , B ) and conditionally deleted Bmi-1 using Nestin-Cre ( Tronche et al . , 1999 ) . This allele of Nestin-Cre deletes broadly throughout the neuroepithelium by E10 . 5 such that there is nearly homogeneous recombination in the postnatal CNS ( http://cre . jax . org/Nes/Nes-CreNano . html ) . Consistent with this , Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice exhibited a loss of Bmi-1 protein in the cortex and SVZ by western blot ( Figure 6B ) and a loss of Bmi-1 transcripts in SVZ cells , GEPCOT cells , and pre-GEPCOT cells by qRT-PCR ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 009Figure 6 .

Targeting strategy for engineering a floxed allele of Bmi-1 for conditional deletion . ( A ) A bacterial artificial chromosome containing the mouse Bmi-1 gene ( RP23-145I3 ) , was modified to insert a loxP-FRT-Neo-FRT cassette 5′ to exon 2 and a loxP site 3′ to exon 3 to generate the targeting vector . These sites were selected to avoid disrupting conserved sequences , which are potential regulatory elements . Correctly targeted ES cells ( Bmi1fl-Neo ) were generated using W4 ES cells and identified by southern blotting ( B ) using 5′ and 3′ probes . After generating chimeric mice that gave germline transmission , Bmi1fl-Neo mice were mated with Flp deleter mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) to remove the Neo cassette . The resulting Bmi-1fl mice were backcrossed for at least 10 generations onto a C57BL background . Cre recombination of this allele deletes the start codon and generates a frameshift mutation .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 010 Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice were modestly but significantly smaller than littermate controls ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ) . Unlike germline Bmi-1 deficient mice , which generally die within a month after birth ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Lessard and Sauvageau , 2003; Park et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) , we were able to age Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice for up to 2 years . These mice did exhibit neurological deficits that worsened during aging , such as ataxia , as was reported in germline Bmi-1 deficient mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994 ) . However , the survival of Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice throughout adulthood made it possible for the first time to test whether Bmi-1 is autonomously required by qNSCs or NICs in the adult brain . Consistent with the phenotype of germline Bmi-1 deficient mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) , brain morphology appeared relatively normal in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6C , Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ) . Brain size was slightly but significantly reduced in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice as compared to littermate controls ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1D ) but was normal as a proportion of body mass ( data not shown ) . The cerebellums from Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice were smaller than in control mice and had significantly thinner molecular layers ( Figure 6D , E ) . We also observed unusually prominent GFAP staining throughout the cortex of adult Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1F ) . Otherwise , the olfactory bulb , hippocampus , and cortex appeared grossly normal ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ) , though additional work will be required to carefully assess laminar organization and identity in each brain region . Our data suggest that the smaller cerebellums and prominent GFAP staining reflect a cell-autonomous requirement for Bmi-1 in fetal neural stem/progenitor cells . We observed complete Bmi-1 recombination in sorted SVZ cells , GEPCOT cells , and pre-GEPCOT cells isolated from adult Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6F ) . 12 month-old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice exhibited a significantly reduced number of SVZ cells that incorporated a 2-hr pulse of BrdU ( Figure 6G ) . We measured the rate of neurogenesis in Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and Bmi-1fl/fl controls by administering BrdU for 7 days ( beginning at 4 or 14 months of age ) followed by a 4-week chase without BrdU . We quantified the frequency of BrdU+NeuN+ newborn neurons in sections from the olfactory bulb by microscopy . Bmi-1 deletion had no effect on neurogenesis at 4 months of age , but significantly reduced olfactory bulb neurogenesis in 14-month-old mice ( Figure 6H , p<0 . 01 ) . Neurospheres formed by Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl SVZ cells were significantly smaller than control neurospheres ( Figure 6I ) , were unable to undergo multilineage differentiation ( Figure 6J ) , and could not be passaged ( Figure 6K ) . In contrast , control neurospheres readily underwent multilineage differentiation ( Figure 6J ) and were able to generate multipotent daughter neurospheres upon subcloning into secondary cultures ( Figure 6K ) . To assess whether Bmi-1 deficiency affected pre-GEPCOT qNSCs or GEPCOT NICs in vivo we assessed the frequencies of these cells in SVZs from 4 and 12 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls . The frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells was significantly reduced at 4 months of age ( Figure 6L ) . We observed no significant effects on the frequencies of GEPCOT cells ( Figure 6M ) or neuroblasts ( Figure 6N ) at 4 months of age . However , each of these populations was significantly depleted in 12 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6L–N ) . Bmi-1 is thus required for the maintenance of normal numbers of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs in the adult brain . Nonetheless , some pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neurogenesis did persist for at least a year in adult mice , demonstrating that NSCs are not absolutely dependent upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance in the adult brain . Bmi-1 promotes the maintenance of neural stem cells partly by repressing the Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a/p19Arf ) locus ( Jacobs et al . , 1999; Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007 ) . We were unable to detect Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in wild-type SVZ cells , pre-GEPCOT qNSCs , or GEPCOT NICs in 4-month-old ( 0/5 ) or 12 month old ( 0/5 ) mice ( Figure 6O ) . In contrast , 4-month old Bmi-1-deficient SVZ cells ( 5/5 mice ) and pre-GEPCOT cells ( 4/5 mice ) did express Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) and the level of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression significantly increased between 4 and 12 months of age ( Figure 6O; detected in 5/5 mice for both populations ) . Low level Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression was detected in GEPCOT cells from two of five 4 month-old Bmi-1-deficient mice and in GEPCOT cells from one of five 12 month old Bmi-1-deficient mice ( Figure 6O ) . Bmi-1 is thus required to repress Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . To conditionally delete Bmi-1 in the adult brain we used Nestin-CreERT2 , which deletes broadly throughout the SVZ , including within qNSCs that give rise to SVZ cells after AraC treatment ( Giachino and Taylor , 2009 ) . We observed significantly lower levels of Nestin transcripts within pre-GEPCOT qNSCs as compared to GEPCOT NICs ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1A ) and only 9 . 3 ± 7 . 3% of pre-GEPCOTs stained positively for Nestin protein as compared to 89 . 7 ± 8 . 5% of GEPCOTs and 39 . 0 ± 5 . 3% of SVZ cells ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B ) . We also observed higher levels of Nestin transgene expression in GEPCOT cells as compared to pre-GEPCOT cells , including Nestin-mCherry and Nestin-GFP ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1C , D ) . However , when we analyzed recombination of a conditional reporter in Nestin-CreERT2 mice , we observed labeling of 99 ± 1 . 1% of GEPCOT cells and 96 ± 1 . 9% of pre-GEPCOT cells ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1E ) . Therefore , although endogenous Nestin is expressed at lower levels in qNSCs as compared to NICs , Nestin second intronic enhancer transgenes are variably expressed in both pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs , and Nestin-CreERT2 gives nearly complete recombination in both cell populations . We administered tamoxifen in the chow of Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls for 30 days beginning at 6 weeks of age and assessed recombination efficiency 2 weeks after completing tamoxifen treatment ( i . e . , starting at 3 months of age ) . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis of genomic DNA from individual neurospheres revealed complete deletion of Bmi-1 in at least 95% of neurospheres ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2A , B ) . Western blot analysis demonstrated a near total loss of Bmi-1 protein from neurospheres ( Figure 7A ) , consistent with the high rate of recombination in individual neurospheres . By PCR analysis of genomic DNA we observed near complete recombination in unfractionated SVZ cells and complete recombination in pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells isolated from adult Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 7B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 011Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 013 Body mass ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2C ) , brain histology ( data not shown ) , and cerebellum size ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2D ) were all grossly normal in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice six months after tamoxifen treatment . To assess the consequences of Bmi-1 deletion from adult neural stem/progenitor cells , we measured the rate of neurogenesis in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and Bmi-1fl/fl controls by administering BrdU for 7 days ( beginning at 2 weeks , 6 months and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , at which time the mice were approximately 3 months old , 9 months old and 15 months old , respectively ) followed by a 4-week chase without BrdU . Bmi-1 deficiency had no effect on the frequency of BrdU+NeuN+ newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment but significantly reduced neurogenesis 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen ( Figure 7C , p<0 . 05 ) . The reduced neurogenesis in Bmi-1 mutant mice was evident in all subsets of neurons that we investigated , including BrdU+Calretinin+ neurons , BrdU+Calbindin+ neurons , and BrdU+Tyrosine Hydroxylase+ neurons ( Figure 7D , E ) . Bmi-1 is therefore required in adult neural stem/progenitor cells for normal neurogenesis but Bmi-1 deficiency did not completely eliminate the generation of forebrain neurons during the first year of life . Consistent with prior studies , the vast majority of the newborn cells in the adult olfactory bulb were neurons , but the small numbers of astrocytes that arose in the olfactory bulb and oligodendrocytes that arose in the cortex were also diminished after Bmi-1 deletion . The frequency of newborn olfactory bulb BrdU+S100β+ astrocytes appeared normal 6 months after tamoxifen treatment but was significantly reduced 12 months after tamoxifen in Bmi-1 mutant mice ( Figure 7F ) . The frequency of newborn cortical BrdU+GST-pi+ oligodendrocytes declined 6 months after tamoxifen treatment and could no longer be detected after 12 months ( Figure 7G ) . The deficits in neurogenesis and gliogenesis became worse over time after Bmi-1 deletion . We quantified the frequency of SVZ cells that incorporated a 2-hr pulse of BrdU . Bmi-1 mutant mice had significant reductions in the frequencies of BrdU+ SVZ cells at 2 weeks ( 50% reduction , p<0 . 02 ) , 6 months ( 55% reduction , p<0 . 02 ) and 12 months ( 90% reduction , p<0 . 001 ) after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7H ) . Bmi-1 mutant mice also had significant ( p<0 . 001 ) reductions in the frequencies of Mcm2+ ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2E , G ) and Ki67+ ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2F ) SVZ cells . Consistent with this , Bmi-1 mutant mice exhibited significant ( p<0 . 001 ) declines in the frequencies of Dcx+ ( Figure 7I ) and CD24midPSA-NCAM+ neuroblasts ( Figure 7J ) 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment . To assess whether Bmi-1 is required by adult NICs we plated SVZ cells from tamoxifen-treated Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl and control mice in non-adherent cultures and assessed GEPCOT cell frequency . 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment the frequencies of NICs ( Figure 7K ) and GEPCOTs ( Figure 7Q ) were unchanged in Bmi-1 mutant mice as compared to littermate controls . However , the Bmi-1-deficient neurospheres were significantly smaller than control neurospheres ( Figure 7L , M ) and did not undergo multilineage differentiation ( Figure 7N; they formed only astrocytes upon transfer to adherent cultures ) or self-renew upon subcloning ( Figure 7O ) . At 6 and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , Bmi-1 deficient SVZ cells formed virtually no neurospheres ( Figure 7K ) . Consistent with this , Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice also had significantly lower frequencies of GEPCOTs than control mice at 6 months and 12 months after tamoxifen treatment , and the magnitude of the depletion increased over time ( Figure 7Q ) . Virtually no GEPCOTs could be found in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 12 months after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7Q ) . These data demonstrate that GEPCOT NICs require Bmi-1 in vivo for their maintenance in the adult SVZ , though the cells are able to persist for several months after Bmi-1 deletion before they are completely eliminated . To test whether qNSCs depend upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance in vivo we examined the frequency of pre-GEPCOT cells in tamoxifen-treated Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice and littermate controls . pre-GEPCOT cells were not depleted at 2 weeks or 6 months after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7P ) . We observed a clear trend toward reduced pre-GEPCOT cell frequency in Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 12 months after tamoxifen treatment but the effect was not statistically significant . To test whether there was a loss of Bmi-1 function in these cells we performed qRT-PCR to assess Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice . One mechanism by which Bmi-1 promotes the maintenance of neural stem/progenitor cells is by negatively regulating Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression ( Jacobs et al . , 1999; Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005 ) . We did not detect Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in wild-type SVZ cells , pre-GEPCOT qNSCs , or GEPCOT NICs 2 weeks ( 0/5 ) , 3 months ( 0/6 ) , or 8 months ( 0/7 ) after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 7R ) . We rarely detected Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts in SVZ cells or GEPCOT cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 2 weeks ( 0/5 SVZ , 0/5 GEPCOT ) , 3 months ( 0/5 SVZ , 1/5 GEPCOT ) or 8 months ( 1/9 SVZ , 0/9 GEPCOT ) after tamoxifen treatment . Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) transcripts were rarely detected in pre-GEPCOT cells from Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice 2 weeks ( 0/5 ) or 3 months ( 1/5 ) after tamoxifen treatment . However , 8 months after tamoxifen treatment Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression was detected in pre-GEPCOT cells from seven of nine Nestin-CreERT2; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 7R , Figure 7—figure supplement 2H ) . These data demonstrate that Bmi-1 is required during adulthood to negatively regulate Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT qNSCs but that these cells are depleted more slowly than GEPCOT NICs in the adult SVZ . Although high levels of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression are associated with cellular senescence , we were unable to detect any increase in senescence associated β-galactosidase activity in pre-GEPCOT cells from 14 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice or in cultured neural stem/progenitor cells from Bmi-1 germline deficient mice ( data not shown ) .\nBy screening almost 400 antibodies against distinct cell surface antigens we identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ ( Figure 8 ) . GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs ( Figure 1C ) and highly mitotically active in vivo ( Figure 1D ) but persisted only transiently in the SVZ based on fate mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 or Dlx1CreERT2 ( Figure 2B , C ) . In contrast , pre-GEPCOT cells lacked the ability to form neurospheres or adherent colonies in culture ( Figure 4B ) , and were quiescent in vivo ( Figure 4C ) but were long-lived in the SVZ based on fate mapping with the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , GFAP-CreERT2 ( Giachino et al . , 2013 ) , Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) , and Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005; Lee et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 4F–J ) . In contrast to GEPCOT NICs , pre-GEPCOT cells were resistant to TMZ ( Figure 5E , F ) . Although TMZ eliminated virtually all NICs from the SVZ ( Figure 5D ) , the dividing cells , NICs , and GEPCOTs regenerated within a month of TMZ treatment ( Figure 5 ) . The persistence of pre-GEPCOT cells after TMZ ( Figure 5F ) , and the regeneration of GEPCOTs from a precursor that expresses Slc1a3-CreERT and GFAP-CreERT2 but not Ascl1CreERT2 ( Figure 5N–P ) suggest that the SVZ regenerates from pre-GEPCOT qNSCs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 014Figure 8 . Phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs . GlasthighEGFR−/lowPlexinB2midCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− pre-GEPCOT cells are a quiescent , TMZ resistant population containing qNSCs that give rise to GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− GEPCOT cells that are highly mitotically active in vivo and enriched for NICs . pre-GEPCOT cells include Type B1 cells , GEPCOT cells include Type C cells , and neuroblasts make up Type A SVZ cells ( Doetsch et al . , 1997; Doetsch et al . , 1999a ) . Bars for different Cre alleles represent the extent of recombination observed after 5 consecutive days of tamoxifen treatment followed by a 2 day chase . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02669 . 014 The conclusion that pre-GEPCOT cells include qNSCs is also supported by the sustained contribution of GFAP-CreERT2 marked cells to the SVZ , as GFAP-CreERT2 labeled many pre-GEPCOT cells but few GEPCOT cells or NICs immediately after tamoxifen treatment ( Figure 3A , Figure 4I ) . Thus , our data demonstrate that GFAP-CreERT2 recombination is a marker of qNSCs that survive treatment with anti-mitotic agents and contribute to an increasing proportion of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neuroblasts over time ( Figures 4I and 5M–P ) . NSCs are commonly estimated to account for a few percent of cells in germinal zones in the adult mouse brain ( Doetsch et al . , 1997; Mirzadeh et al . , 2008; Pastrana et al . , 2009 ) . Although pre-GEPCOT cells accounted for 6 ± 3% of SVZ cells , this population is likely to be heterogeneous , consistent with its heterogeneous GFAP expression ( Figure 4A ) . Thus , the actual frequency of qNSCs in the SVZ may be lower than 6% . The current lack of a clonal assay for qNSCs makes it impossible to test the purity of this population . In an effort to identify culture conditions permissive for colony formation by pre-GEPCOT cells we screened 36 different growth factors or medium supplements but none significantly increased colony formation by SVZ cells from normal or TMZ-treated mice ( Supplementary file 1B ) . Thus , future studies will be required to develop culture conditions that permit efficient colony formation by individual qNSCs and to isolate these cells at high purity . An interesting question for future studies will be whether there are regional differences in the distributions or properties of pre-GEPCOT qNSCs or GEPCOT NICs within the SVZ , corresponding to regional differences in stem/progenitor cell properties ( Merkle et al . , 2007 , 2014; Ihrie et al . , 2011 ) . Germline deficiency for the polycomb family member Bmi-1 eliminates multipotent NICs and reduces proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Zencak et al . , 2005; Bruggeman et al . , 2007; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . However , the lack of a floxed allele of Bmi-1 , the death of germline Bmi-1-deficient mice before adulthood , and the lack of prospective markers for NSCs made it impossible to directly test whether Bmi-1 was required for the maintenance of adult NSCs in vivo . Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 from the fetal and adult SVZ using Nestin-Cre ( Figure 6 ) and Nestin-CreERT2 ( Figure 7 ) demonstrated that pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs require Bmi-1 to be maintained in normal numbers in the adult forebrain , but the depletion of these cells and the loss of neurogenesis occurred much more gradually than expected . Even when Bmi-1 was completely deleted in neural stem/progenitor cells during fetal development , normal or near-normal numbers of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and SVZ neuroblasts were found in the SVZ of 4 month old Nestin-Cre; Bmi-1fl/fl mice ( Figure 6L–N ) . This demonstrates that pre-GEPCOT qNSCs and GEPCOT NICs can persist throughout fetal and postnatal development , and into adulthood , in the absence of Bmi-1 . This suggests that qNSCs and NICs are less acutely dependent upon Bmi-1 for their maintenance than expected based on studies of Bmi-1 germline knockout mice ( van der Lugt et al . , 1994; Molofsky et al . , 2003; Bruggeman et al . , 2005; Molofsky et al . , 2005; Fasano et al . , 2009 ) . There are likely several reasons why Bmi-1 germline knockout mice appeared to exhibit a more severe loss of neural stem/progenitor cells and neurogenesis than is evident in conditional knockout mice . First , the phenotype in Bmi-1 germline knockout mice may indeed be more severe as non-cell-autonomous effects of Bmi-1 deficient stroma contribute to stem cell deficits in these mice ( Oguro et al . , 2006 , 2010 ) . Second , the death of Bmi-1 germline knockout mice before young adulthood meant that adult phenotypes could not be studied directly and it was assumed that the deficits observed in the early postnatal period would rapidly worsen over time . Third , without the ability to prospectively identify qNSCs or NICs in vivo , these cells could only be studied based on neurosphere formation in culture . Since p16Ink4a and p19Arf expression are induced to a greater extent in culture than in vivo , the severity of Bmi-1 deficiency phenotypes in the nervous system are sometimes exaggerated in culture ( Molofsky et al . , 2005; He et al . , 2009 ) . Our data indicate that Bmi-1 is not required for the persistence of NSCs or neurogenesis into adulthood , though both are depleted over time during adulthood after Bmi-1 deletion . Consistent with the gradual depletion of pre-GEPCOT cells , GEPCOT cells , and neurogenesis during adulthood after conditional Bmi-1 deletion , we also observed a gradual increase in Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression in pre-GEPCOT cells but not in GEPCOT cells ( Figures 6O and 7R , Figure 7—figure supplement 2H ) . This suggests that qNSCs are particularly dependent upon Bmi-1 for the repression of Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) expression . The identification of markers that prospectively identify and isolate distinct populations of qNSCs and NICs will make it possible to characterize their properties in vivo rather than relying upon colony-forming assays in culture . Use of commercially available antibodies against cell surface antigens will enable such studies in a wide range of genetic backgrounds . Our data on Bmi-1 demonstrate how the existence of these markers makes it possible to assess the function of gene products within the neural stem/progenitor cell pool with a more granular appreciation for effects on qNSCs vs NICs .\nC57Bl/6 were maintained in standard cages with water and standard diet ( Teklad 2916 ) ad libitum . Rosa26CAG-loxp-Stop-loxp-tdTomato ( Ai14 ) ( referred to here as Rosa26-loxp-tdTomato ) ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) , Gli1CreERT2 ( Ahn and Joyner , 2005 ) , Sox2CreERT2 ( Arnold et al . , 2011 ) , Dlx1CreERT2 ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Tg ( Slc1a3-CreERT ) ( Wang et al . , 2012 ) , Tg ( Nestin-Cre ) ( Tronche et al . , 1999 ) and Tg ( Ubc-GFP ) ( Schaefer et al . , 2001 ) mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . Tg ( GFAP-CreERT2 ) ( Hirrlinger et al . , 2006 ) mice were provided by Frank Kirchhoff . Tg ( Nestin-GFP ) ( Birbrair et al . , 2011 ) and Tg ( Nestin-mCherry ) ( Ding et al . , 2012 ) mice were kindly provided by Grigori Enikopalov . Tg ( Nestin-CreERT2 ) mice were provided by G Fishell ( Balordi and Fishell , 2007 ) . Ascl1CreERT2 ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) mice were housed in the Johnson laboratory . All mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/Ka background for at least three generations prior to analysis . For BrdU pulses up to 24 hr , 100 mg of BrdU/kg body mass dissolved in PBS was injected i . p . every 6 hours . For 2-week pulses of BrdU , mice were initially injected with 100 mg of BrdU/kg body mass then maintained on drinking water that contained 1 mg/ml BrdU until sacrifice . Targeting vectors to generate Bmi1fl mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) were constructed by recombineering ( Liu et al . , 2003 ) . W4 ES cells were electroporated with the targeting vector and positive clones identified by southern blotting were injected into blastocysts from C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J mice . The resulting male chimeric mice were bred to female C57BL/6-Tyrc-2J mice to obtain germline transmission . The FRT-Neo-FRT cassette was removed by crossing with Flp deleter mice ( Rodriguez et al . , 2000 ) , and then Bmi1fl mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/Ka background for at least 10 generations . Animal protocols were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals and the UT Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( protocol# 2011-0104 ) . Tamoxifen ( T5648; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was dissolved in 90% corn oil/10% ethanol at 20 mg/ml , and injected at 80 mg/kg/day i . p . for 5 consecutive days into 8–12 week-old mice , then the mice were chased for 2 , 7 , 28 , or 60 days until analysis . For Bmi-1 experiments , tamoxifen citrate ( Sigma or Spectrum Chemical , New Brunswick , NJ ) was given in chow at 400 mg/kg with 5% sucrose ( Harlan ) to 6 week-old mice for 30 days . Mice were then fed a standard diet for at least 14 days before analysis . TMZ ( T2577; Sigma ) was dissolved in 25% DMSO/75% 0 . 9% saline solution at 10 mg/ml by heating briefly to 90–100°C , then shaking and rapidly cooling . Mice were injected at 100 mg/kg/day for 3 consecutive days then allowed to recover for 3–90 days before analysis . Mice with enlarged spleen or thymus ( sometimes present at 90 days after TMZ treatment ) were excluded from analysis . SVZs from adult ( 8–60 week old ) mice were dissected as described ( Mirzadeh et al . , 2010 ) . SVZs were minced and digested with 300 µl of trypsin solution ( Ca and Mg-free HBSS , 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 0 . 25 mg/ml trypsin ( EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , 10 μg/ml DNase I ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , pH 7 . 6 ) at 37°C for 20 min . Digestion was quenched with three volumes of staining medium ( 440 ml Leibovitz L-15 medium , 50 ml water , 5 ml 1M HEPES pH 7 . 3–7 . 4 , 5 ml 100x Pen-Strep , 20 ml 77 . 7 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 [prepared from Na2H2EDTA] , 1 g bovine serum albumin [A7030; Sigma] ) containing 100 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor ( T6522; Sigma ) and 10 μg/ml DNase I ( Roche ) . Digested SVZ pieces were centrifuged ( 220×g , 4 min , 4°C ) then fresh staining medium was added and the pieces were triturated in 300 μl by gently drawing into a P1000 pipetman and expelling 25 times without forming bubbles . The cell suspension was then filtered through a 45-micron mesh , counted on a hemocytometer , and added to culture or processed for flow cytometry . Neurosphere formation , self-renewal , and differentiation assays were performed as described previously ( Molofsky et al . , 2003; Nishino et al . , 2008 ) , except that in some cases 10 μM Y-27632 hydrochloride ( Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor; Tocris Biosciences 1254 , Bristol , UK ) and 20 ng/ml IGF-1 ( 291-G1; R&D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) were also added to the culture medium because they were found to promote clonogenesis after sorting adult SVZ cells ( data not shown ) . For adherent colony formation , Tg ( Ubc-GFP ) SVZ cells were co-cultured with ∼80–90% confluent nontransgenic neonatal SVZ-derived astrocytes isolated and passaged twice prior to the experiment . GFP fluorescence was used to assess colony formation after 12–20 days in culture . For screening for markers of NICs , typically SVZs from 5–10 mice were pooled and stained with antibodies then analyzed using a 4 laser FACSAria III ( Becton Dickenson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Markers that stained SVZ cells heterogeneously were used to separate SVZ cells by flow cytometry into different fractions then sorted into non-adherent cultures to measure the frequency of NICs . To stain SVZ cells with the combination of markers used to isolate GEPCOT or pre-GEPCOT cells , dissociated SVZ cells were centrifuged ( 220×g , 4 min , 4°C ) and resuspended in 100 μl staining medium per brain . Then the following antibodies were added: BV421 anti-Ter119 ( 116233; 1/100; Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) , BV421 anti-CD45 ( 103133; 1/100; Biolegend ) , APC-eFluor 780 anti-CD24 ( 47-0242-82; 1/200; eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) , 5A5 ascites ( anti-PSA-NCAM; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Iowa City , IA , 1/100 ) , O4 ascites ( 1/200 ) , anti-PlexinB2 ( 14-5665-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , biotinylated anti-EGFR ( BAF1280 , 1/200; R&D Systems ) , anti-Glast ( 130-095-822; 1/10; Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) , and DAPI ( 50 μg/ml , 1/100 ) . After adding antibodies , the cells were incubated on ice for 45 min , then washed with 2 . 5 ml fresh staining medium and pelleted ( 220g for 4 min at 4°C ) and resuspended in secondary antibodies . Typically we used the following combination: APC anti-mouse IgG2a ( 115-135-206; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) , PE anti-hamster IgG ( 127-115-160; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch ) , PE-Cy7 anti-mouse IgM ( 25-5790-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , BV605-Streptavidin ( 563260; 1/200; BD Biosciences ) . However when analyzing mice expressing tdTomato we used the following alternative secondary antibodies: PerCP-eFluor 710 anti-mouse IgG ( 46-4010-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , APC anti-hamster IgG ( 127-135-160; 1/200; Jackson Immunoresearch ) , PE-Cy7 anti-mouse IgM ( 25-5790-82; 1/100; eBioscience ) , BV605-Streptavidin ( 563260; 1/200; BD Biosciences ) . Cells were stained with secondary antibodies on ice for 45 min , then washed and pelleted as above , and analyzed on the FACSAria in a volume of 200 μl per brain . When sorting cells onto slides , a drop of 8 μl staining medium was placed on a SuperFrost Plus slide , and 100–300 cells were sorted directly into the drop . The slide was then kept humid for 45–60 min at ambient temperature to allow the cells to attach to the glass , then the cells were fixed with 4% PFA ( 20 min , RT ) . Cells were then permeabilized and stained with rat anti-BrdU ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA , clone Bu1/75 , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , mouse anti-Nestin ( BD clone Rat-401 , 1/100 after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , and rabbit anti-GFAP ( Dako , Carpinteria , CA , 1/3000 ) antibodies using standard techniques . Brains were fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% PFA in PBS , then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS for 1–3 days at 4°C , then frozen in OCT or cryogel on dry ice after 3–12 hr equilibration at 4°C . Sections were cut at 12 μm thickness spanning the rostral half of the SVZ ( typically 6 sections per slide ) or the entire olfactory bulb ( typically 8 sections per slide ) . Sections were immunostained with the following primary antibodies: rat anti-BrdU ( Abcam clone Bu1/75 , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , guinea pig anti-Dcx ( 1/1000; Millipore ) , mouse anti-Mcm2 ( BD Biosciences , 1/500 , after heat-mediated antigen retrieval ) , rat anti-Ki67 ( 1/500; eBioscience ) , mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase ( 1/1000; Millipore ) , rabbit anti-calretinin ( 1/1000; Sigma ) , rabbit anti-calbindin ( 1/500; Millipore ) , rabbit anti-S100β ( 1/1000; Dako ) , rabbit anti-GST-pi ( 1/3000; Enzo , Farmingdale , NY ) , and mouse anti-NeuN ( 1/1000; Millipore ) . Fixed whole-mount SVZs were stained with mouse anti-acetylated tubulin ( 1/1000; Sigma ) , rabbit anti-β-catenin ( 1/500; Sigma ) , mouse anti-GFAP ( 1/3000; Sigma ) , and goat anti-EGFR ( 1/250; R&D Systems ) . Alexa Fluor 488- , 555- , and 647-conjugated secondary antibodies were used ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were resuspended in 10% trichloracetic acid ( TCA , Sigma ) . Extracts were incubated on ice for at least 15 min and centrifuged at 16 , 100×g at 4°C for 15 min . Precipitates were washed in acetone twice and dried . The pellets were solubilized in 9M urea , 2% Triton X-100 , and 1% DTT . LDS loading buffer ( Invitrogen ) was added and the pellet was heated at 70°C for 10 min . Samples were separated on Bis-Trispolyacrylamide gels ( Invitrogen ) and transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore or BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . Membranes were treated with the SuperSignal Western Blot Enhancer ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescence kit ( Thermo Scientific ) . Blots were stripped with 1% SDS , 25 mM glycine ( pH 2 ) prior to reprobing . The following primary antibodies were used for western blots: β-Actin ( AC-15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , Bmi-1 ( F6; Millipore ) . Cells were sorted directly into RLT plus buffer ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol . RNA was extracted with the RNeasy micro plus kit ( Qiagen ) and cDNA was synthesized with the RT2 First Strand Kit ( Qiagen ) . Reactions were run in 20 μl volumes with SYBR green and a LightCycler 480 ( Roche Applied Science ) . Primer sequences were: Bmi-1 F ( Figures 6A ) , 5′-CCAATGGCTCCAATGAAGACC-3′ , Bmi-1 R ( Figures 6A ) , 5′-TTGCTGCTGGGCATCGTAAG-3′ , Bmi-1 F ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) , 5′-CGCTCTTTCCGGGATCTTT-3′ , Bmi-1 R ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) , 5′-CTCCACACAGGACACACATTA-3′ , Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) F , 5′-GTGTGCATGACGTGCGGG-3′ , Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) R , 5′-GCAGTTCGAATCTGCACCGTAG-3′; β-actin F , 5′-CGTCGACAACGGCTCCGGCATG-3′; β-actin R , 5′-GGGCCTCGTCACCCACATAGGAG-3′; Nestin F 5′-GGGCCCAGAGCTTTCCCACG-3′; Nestin R 5′-GGGCATGCACCAGACCCTGTG-3′ . Neurosphere assays were done as previously published by our lab ( Molofsky et al . , 2003 , 2005; Nishino et al . , 2008 ) . However when sorting adult SVZ cells for neurosphere assays several important technical points require attention:",
         "Neurons that arise in the adult nervous system originate from neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells . Neural stem cells have long lives , much of which they spend in a quiescent state . Neural stem cells can also give rise to neural progenitor cells , which proliferate rapidly during their short lives and then ‘differentiate’ into neurons or glia . Unlike some other tissues , it has not been possible to identify or purify neural stem cells directly from the tissue . Consequently , neural stem and progenitor cells have usually been studied retrospectively , based on their ability to form colonies in laboratory cell cultures . A region of the brain called the subventricular zone contains both neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells , and is one of only two regions of the brain where neural stem cells are found in adult mammals . When cells from the subventricular zone are cultured in a way that allows the cells to freely float around ( rather than growing on a surface ) , a few percent form spherical colonies called neurospheres . Since neurosphere-forming cells can self-renew and differentiate into neurons and glia , the ability of cells to form neurospheres has generally been taken as evidence that they are stem cells . However , the exact relationship between neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells has been uncertain . Now , Mich , Signer et al . have used a technique called flow cytometry to identify and isolate neural stem cells and neurosphere-forming cells directly from the subventricular zone . The neural stem cells , which Mich , Signer et al . term pre-GEPCOT cells ( based on an acronym of the markers used to isolate the cells ) , were long-lived and quiescent , but they lacked the ability to form colonies in culture . The neurosphere-forming cells , named GEPCOT cells , were short-lived and highly proliferative in the brain . These results demonstrate that the cells that form neurospheres in culture are not stem cells at all , and that real stem cells are not able to form colonies under existing culture conditions . The identification of undifferentiated pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells will make it possible to directly study the properties of these cells inside the mouse brain , and to isolate live cells to test how they function . The results also highlight the need for new tests to study neural stem cell function , given that current tests using neurospheres do not detect stem cells as commonly assumed .",

         "Cellular heterogeneity hinders the extraction of functionally significant results and inference of regulatory networks from wide-scale expression profiles of complex mammalian organs . The mammalian inner ear consists of the auditory and vestibular systems that are each composed of hair cells , supporting cells , neurons , mesenchymal cells , other epithelial cells , and blood vessels . We developed a novel protocol to sort auditory and vestibular tissues of newborn mouse inner ears into their major cellular components . Transcriptome profiling of the sorted cells identified cell type–specific expression clusters . Computational analysis detected transcription factors and microRNAs that play key roles in determining cell identity in the inner ear . Specifically , our analysis revealed the role of the Zeb1/miR-200b pathway in establishing epithelial and mesenchymal identity in the inner ear . Furthermore , we detected a misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway in the inner ear of Twirler mice , which manifest , among other phenotypes , malformations of the auditory and vestibular labyrinth . The association of misregulation of the ZEB1/miR-200b pathway with auditory and vestibular defects in the Twirler mutant mice uncovers a novel mechanism underlying deafness and balance disorders . Our approach can be employed to decipher additional complex regulatory networks underlying other hearing and balance mouse mutants .\nGenome-wide expression profiling is a valuable tool for gaining systems-level understanding of biological processes during development , response to stress , and pathological conditions . However , accurate interpretation of expression profiles from complex tissues such as neuroepithelia is often complicated and hindered by cellular heterogeneity . Such cellular complexity has made it particularly difficult to identify relevant transcriptional networks from the auditory and vestibular systems of mammalian inner ears , which are composed of hair cells , multiple types of supporting cells , neurons , mesenchymal cells and vascular endothelium . Hereditary hearing loss ( HHL ) is a common congenital sensory disability , affecting 1 in 2000 newborns and a significant portion of the elderly population . The complexity of the auditory and vestibular systems is reflected in over 250 genes which , when mutated , underlie inner ear malformations or dysfunction in mice ( http://hearingimpairment . jax . org/master_table . html ) . Furthermore , there are over 118 syndromes that include hearing loss as part of their phenotype [1] , and over 100 genes – roughly half of which have been cloned which underlie hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss in human ( http://hereditaryhearingloss . org/ ) and [2] . The human and mouse inner ears are remarkably similar and the mouse has proven to be an invaluable tool in the study of hearing loss [3] . Nevertheless , cell type–specific molecular differences between the auditory and vestibular systems , and the signaling cascades upstream and downstream of most of the deafness genes have not been fully deciphered . In this study we demonstrate the utility of endogenously expressed cell surface markers for separating the auditory and vestibular tissues into their major cellular components . We used a cell type–specific transcriptome analysis to identify regulators of cell fate determination in the inner ear . Finally , utilizing the example of the ZEB1/miR-200b pathway , we present a proof-of-concept that cell type–specific gene expression profiles can be used to identify molecular pathways upstream and downstream of deafness genes .\nOur first goal was to develop a protocol for dissociating the inner ear sensory tissues into their major cellular components . We studied the ears of newborn mice to increase the likelihood of identifying genes that are important both for early and terminal differentiation of the inner ear . To identify antibodies that could be used to sort the inner ear into its major cellular compartments , we stained inner ears of P0 wild-type mice with commercially available monoclonal antibodies to the protein products of cell surface cluster of differentiation ( CD ) genes that are expressed in the ear [4] . We found that CD326 ( EpCAM ) is detected in all sensory and non-sensory epithelial cells of the mouse inner ear ( Figure 1A ) . For the purpose of this manuscript , we define the cochlear sensory epithelium as the hair cells , supporting cells and cells of the greater and lesser epithelial ridges ( i . e . epithelial cells that are not part of the stria vascularis or Reissner's membrane ) , and the vestibular sensory epithelium as hair cells and supporting cells . In contrast to CD326 , the epithelial staining of CD49f ( Integrin α6 ) is specific to the sensory epithelial cells . Within the non-epithelial cells , CD49f stains the neuronal and vascular endothelial cells . Finally , antibodies against CD34 , a cell surface protein that is expressed on hematopoietic stem cells and vascular endothelium [5] , specifically and uniquely stain the vascular endothelium in the inner ear . We postulated that inner ear cells can be divided into epithelial and non-epithelial cells based on the expression of CD326 and further divided into sensory epithelial , non-sensory epithelial , neuronal , vascular endothelial and mesenchymal cells based on the expression of CD49f and CD34 ( Figure 1B ) . Flow cytometric analysis of microdissected and dissociated tissues from the auditory and vestibular organs of postnatal day 0 to 1 ( P0-P1 ) wild-type mice revealed a clear separation of vascular endothelial , mesenchymal , neuronal and epithelial cells . Sensory epithelial cells could be distinguished from non-sensory epithelial cells , forming a total of five cellular populations ( Figure 1C , Figure S1A ) . Notably , the proportions of specific populations differed between the auditory and vestibular tissues . For example , the proportion of vascular endothelial cells is greater than three-fold higher in the vestibular tissues compared with the cochlea ( p = 0 . 006 , Figure S1B ) . As we could sort up to four cellular populations simultaneously , we decided to focus our experiments on a total of eight cellular populations – sensory epithelial , neuronal , vascular endothelial and mesenchymal cells from the auditory and vestibular organs . To further test the purity of the sorted cells , total RNA was extracted from each of the eight sorted populations and semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed using primers for the RNA transcripts encoding CD326 , CD49f and CD34 . All sorted cells showed 100- to 1000-fold enrichment for the mRNA that encode the markers used to sort their respective populations , supporting the molecular purity of the sorted populations ( Figure S1C ) . We obtained wide-scale expression profiles of total RNA extracted from sensory epithelial , neuronal , mesenchymal and vascular endothelial cells of the auditory and vestibular tissues of newborn wild-type mice ( a total of eight populations ) . We used the Illumina mouse expression arrays with probes for the majority of RefSeq-annotated genes ( >24 , 000 genes ) , and over 7 , 000 predicted genes to generate eight ‘cell-type specific’ transcriptomes . We generated biologically independent triplicates for each cellular population , yielding a dataset of 24 independent transcriptomes . In the first step of the analysis of this dataset , we examined the overall similarity relations between the 24 transcriptome profiles . To accomplish this goal we subjected the profiles to hierarchical clustering which orders them in the structure of a hierarchical tree ( dendrogram ) in which similar transcriptomes are close to each other , while disparate ones are far apart in the tree . Our dataset's dendrogram clearly contains four main branches corresponding to the four cell types from which expression profiles were obtained ( Figure 2A ) . This structure indicates that the characteristics of the transcriptomes primarily correspond to cell type rather than tissue from which they were obtained . Interestingly , sensory epithelial cells , but not other cell types from the auditory and vestibular tissues , were distinguished by sub-branches . This is consistent with the differentiated and specific functional characteristics of the sensory epithelium in auditory versus vestibular organs . We next examined the dataset for genes whose expression varied significantly among the eight sorted cell populations . Two-way ANOVA tests [6] detected more than 3 , 000 differentially expressed genes ( p<10−5 , FDR<1% , Table S1 ) . We then applied a clustering analysis which distributed these differentially expressed genes into sets based upon distinctive expression patterns [7] . Consistent with the hierarchical clustering results , the major clusters which were found in our dataset showed symmetric patterns of expression between the auditory and vestibular systems in the vast majority of clusters ( Figure 2B and Table S2 ) . For example , the largest clusters contained genes that were highly expressed in the vascular endothelium ( cluster #1 , 754 genes ) or sensory epithelial cells ( cluster #2 , 534 genes ) , in both the auditory and vestibular organs . In contrast , cluster #7 ( 126 genes ) contained genes that were highly expressed only in the auditory sensory cells but not in the corresponding cell population in the vestibular system . To correlate the observed cellular transcriptomes with biological functions , we searched for enrichment of Gene-Ontology ( GO ) functional groups in each of the clusters [8] . All cell type–specific clusters were significantly enriched for functional categories that corresponded with the known roles of the cells ( Figure 2D ) . For example , the clusters that contained genes highly expressed in vascular endothelial , sensory or neuronal cells were significantly enriched for genes which function in ‘angiogenesis’ , ‘sensory perception of sound’ or ‘neuron differentiation’ , respectively , further validating the accuracy of our sorting approach . If differential gene expression implies functional significance , then deafness genes should be over represented in the clusters of differentially expressed genes . Forty-four of 66 genes known to underlie hereditary hearing loss ( syndromic or non-syndromic –Table S3 ) were detected as expressed in our dataset . These genes were significantly over-represented 2 . 5-fold in the set of genes differentially expressed between the cell populations studied . Twenty-four ( 55% ) of the deafness genes were differentially expressed in our dataset ( compared with 22% predicted by random distribution , p = 1 . 2*10−6 ) . Furthermore , the distribution of the deafness-related genes was significantly biased towards clusters 2 and 4 which contain genes highly expressed in sensory epithelial or sensory epithelial and mesenchymal cells , respectively ( p = 0 . 00025 , hyper-geometric tail , Figure 2D ) . We reasoned that additional , yet undiscovered , deafness-related genes may have cell type–specific expression patterns that could be detected using our dataset . As a proof of principle , we searched our dataset of gene expression for positional candidate genes in Auditory Neuropathy Locus 1 ( AUNA1 ) [9] . Prior to being cloned , this deafness locus spanned 18 . 3 megabases and contained 47 protein coding genes . Based on our database , 26 of the protein-coding genes were expressed in the ear , however , only two of these genes were selectively expressed in the neuronal cells of the auditory and vestibular systems: Diap3 , whose human ortholog is now known to underlie AUNA1 , and Trim13 ( Figure S2 ) . Hence a cell type–specific expression analysis of AUNA1 could have prioritized two genes for analysis . As functionally related proteins often physically interact , we conducted an integrated analysis to search for groups of genes that both show similar expression patterns in the inner ear and are physically linked in the cellular web of protein-protein interactions [10] . Several expression-interaction modules were identified in our dataset ( Figure 3 and Figure S3 ) . Significantly , Module #7 contained genes highly expressed in sensory cells and was enriched for proteins that function in ‘inner ear morphogenesis’ ( Figure 3B ) . This physically connected network contains two known non-syndromic deafness genes MYO6 ( MIM ID 600970 ) and TMPRSS3 ( MIM ID 605511 ) . We speculated that defects in other proteins in this module could underlie hereditary hearing loss . To identify novel candidates , we correlated the genomic location of the human orthologues of the genes encoding the proteins in this expression-interaction module with the genomic intervals of the deafness loci for which the disease-causing genes are not yet identified . We found that the human orthologues of 15 of the genes in module #7 map to linkage intervals of uncloned deafness loci ( Figure 3C ) . For example , ATP1B1 and NME7 are candidate genes for DFNA7 based both on enrichment in the sensory epithelial cells and their involvement in this protein-protein interaction sub-network ( Figure 3C , marked with asterisks ) . For ten of the deafness loci , our analysis identified candidate genes that are connected to known deafness genes by the protein-protein interaction network ( Table S4 ) . With the increased use of whole-exome sequencing to clone deafness genes , cell type–specific expression patterns can provide valuable information , specifically when multiple changes are seen within a single linkage interval . Expression of miRNAs is essential for the development of the inner ear . Specifically , mutations in miR-96 have recently been found to underlie hereditary non-syndromic hearing loss in humans and mice [11]–[13] . miRNAs modulate the expression of genes by affecting either the translation of mRNA to protein or the stability of mRNAs . Previous studies demonstrate that activity of miRNAs in specific biological conditions can be inferred from comparative analysis of mRNA expression profiles [14] , [15] . The premise of this in silico approach is that each miRNA typically down-regulates the expression of dozens of target mRNAs , thereby leaving a molecular signature on the cellular transcriptome that marks its activity . Significant down-regulation of miRNA targets in a certain cell population therefore implies enhanced activity of that miRNA in the biological condition of interest . Our in silico search for miRNAs detected four candidate families whose predicted targets were depleted in a statistically significant manner in selected cell populations ( Figure 4A ) . Reassuringly , the top-scoring miRNA identified by this analysis was miR-96 . In comparison with other genes , the set of predicted targets of miR-96 was significantly down-regulated in sensory epithelial cells both in the auditory and vestibular systems ( p-value 4 . 64E-11 and 9 . 28E-09 , respectively; Wilcoxon test ) . This bioinformatics analysis pinpointed miR-96 as a major regulator of gene expression in sensory cells of the inner ear , without using any prior knowledge of this organ , and provided a comprehensive list of putative targets of miR-96 in inner ear sensory epithelia ( Table S6 ) . We also found that predicted targets of miR-128 were significantly down-regulated in the neurons of the auditory and vestibular systems , while the predicted targets of miR-9 were significantly down-regulated only in the neurons of the auditory system . Both miR-128 and miR-9 are known to have an important function in neuronal development [16] . Finally , the set of predicted targets of the miR-200b family were significantly down-regulated in sensory cells of the auditory and vestibular systems while being significantly up-regulated in mesenchymal cells . This finding strongly suggests that miR-200b is expressed and active in sensory epithelial cells while its levels are very low in mesenchymal cells of the inner ear , consistent with the documented role of the family of miR-200b in establishing and maintaining an epithelial phenotype of cells . To validate this result , whole mount in-situ hybridizations were performed on newborn inner ears of wild type mice with a probe for miR-200b , as well as a probe for miR-182 ( a miRNA that is expressed in hair cells and ganglion cells of the ear [17] ) as a positive control , and a no-probe negative control . As predicted by the in silico analysis , miR-200b is expressed in all of the sensory epithelial cells of the newborn mouse inner ear , both in the auditory and the vestibular systems ( Figure 4B ) . Furthermore , the expression of miR-200b is epithelial-specific and included both the sensory and non-sensory epithelial cells . In order to identify transcription factors ( TFs ) that determine cell fate in the inner-ear , we applied a bioinformatics approach which , under the assumption that co-expression of transcripts over multiple conditions implies their transcriptional co-regulation , statistically searches for cis-regulatory elements that are over-represented in promoter regions of the sets of co-expressed genes [18] . We applied this approach to the sets of cell-type specific marker genes which were identified by our trasncriptomic analysis ( see Materials and Methods , Figure S4 and Table S5 ) . This de novo motif discovery analysis identified a top scoring motif that was significantly enriched in the set of promoters of the sensory marker genes ( Figure 5A ) , and corresponds to the binding signature of the ZEB1 and ZEB2 transcription factors [19] . ZEB1 and ZEB2 are primarily repressors of transcription [20] . Thus , the enrichment of the ZEB1/2 binding signature in the promoters of sensory marker genes suggests that Zeb1 and Zeb2 are expressed in all cell types except sensory epithelial cells where their targets can be expressed due to lack of suppression . The second statistically significant DNA motif in our dataset was identified in the promoters of genes specifically expressed in vascular endothelial cells and corresponds to the binding signature of the c-Ets-1/2 transcription factors ( Figure 5A ) . c-Ets1 and c-Ets2 are transcriptional activators , and therefore the enrichment of their binding signature in promoters of blood vessel markers suggests that these factors are specifically expressed in blood vessel cells . Examination of the mRNA expression patterns of Zeb1 , Zeb2 , c-Ets1 and c-Ets2 in our dataset confirmed these predictions , showing a depletion of Zeb1 and Zeb2 mRNA from the sensory epithelial cells and an enrichment of c-Ets1 and c-Ets2 mRNA in the vascular endothelial cells ( Figure 5B ) . These results corroborate the computationally-derived hypotheses implicating major roles for Zeb1/Zeb2 and c-Ets1/c-Ets2 in suppressing an epithelial and enhancing a vascular endothelial phenotype , respectively , in the inner ear . To validate the expression of Zeb1 , inner ear sections from newborn wild-type mice were stained with an antibody against Zeb1 [21] , and epithelial cells were labeled with CD326 . As expected , all non-epithelial cells in the auditory and vestibular organs express Zeb1 while none of the epithelial cells show any Zeb1 expression , consistent with our in silico predictions . No expression was detected in the sections stained with the pre-immune serum ( Figure 5C and Figure S5 ) . Thus , our computational analysis identified the miR-200b-ZEB1/2 pathway as a key regulator of epithelial and mesenchymal identities in the inner ear ( Figure 5D ) . Importantly , a major mechanism by which miR-200b achieves this function is direct down-regulation of Zeb1 and Zeb2 [22] . Our in situ hybridization results for miR-200b and immunolocalization for Zeb1 confirm that Zeb1 and miR-200b are expressed in mutually exclusive cell populations in the ear . Twirler mutant mice have , among other phenotypes , auditory and vestibular defects [23] . Recently , a single nucleotide change in the first intron of Zeb1 was shown to underlie the phenotype of Twirler [24] . The mutation leads to an up-regulation of Zeb1 RNA and protein [24] , although how this leads to the observed phenotype is still unresolved . We therefore hypothesized that if ZEB1 function is compromised in Twirler mice , many epithelial genes should be de-repressed and abnormally expressed in non-epithelial compartments . To test this hypothesis , auditory and vestibular epithelia were dissected from newborn Tw/Tw mice and their wild type littermate controls , dissociated and sorted into CD326-positive and -negative cells , which in wild type mice represent the epithelial and non-epithelial compartments . We compared the expression levels of the epithelial marker genes in CD326-negative cells of the Tw/Tw mice and their wild type controls . In full accordance with our model , the expression of epithelial markers was strikingly elevated in CD326-negative cells of the Tw/Tw mice ( p = 3 . 7*10−12 for the cochlea and p = 1 . 29*10−15 for the vestibular system , Wilcoxon test ) , consistent with a severe misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway in Twirler inner ear ( Figure 6A ) . Conversely , a relative down-regulation of mesenchymal marker transcripts was identified in the CD326-negative cells of the Tw/Tw mice . We next examined the expression levels of epithelial markers in CD326-positive and negative cells dissected from the auditory and vestibular epithelia of Tw/+ mice . Notably , while Tw/+ mice have vestibular dysfunction associated with structurally abnormal semicircular canals , their hearing impairment is variable and the only observed auditory structural defect is shortening of the cochlear duct [24] . In accordance with the results we obtained for the Tw/Tw mice , the set of epithelial marker genes showed significantly elevated expression in the CD326-negative cells of the Tw/+ vestibular systems compared with wild-type controls although the elevation was not as strong as it was in the Tw/Tw ears ( p = 1 . 8*10−7 and p = 1 . 3*10−15 , respectively , and Figure S6A ) . Tw/+ cochlear ducts showed no significant change in expression of sensory markers , consistent with the incompletely penetrant and mild auditory phenotype in these mice ( Figure S6B and [24] ) . Taken together , the cell type–specific transcriptomes of heterozygous and homozygous Tw auditory and vestibular organs support our hypothesis that the Tw mutation exerts its pathogenic affect via misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway . Many of the epithelial marker genes that were misregulated in the Tw/Tw mice harbor a ZEB1 binding site signature in their promoters ( Figure 6B ) . Interestingly , this group of genes contains several genes that encode for proteins that form the extracellular matrices of the mouse inner ear: Tecta , Tectb , Otog , and Oc90 [25] , [26] . Otogelin , and α- and β tectorins are necessary for proper formation of the tectorial membrane , a gelatinous matrix that covers that apical surface of the hair cells in the cochlea . This matrix contacts the hair cell stereocilia and is important for proper deflection of the stereocilia in response to sound . Otoconin-90 ( Oc90 ) forms part of the organic component of the otoconia , small calcium carbonate-enriched protein matrices that are essential for sensing linear acceleration and gravity by the utricle and saccule , respectively . To validate these results , sections of inner ears from newborn Twirler mice and their littermate controls were stained with antibodies against α-tectorin , otogelin and Oc90 . For all of these proteins , wild type expression was restricted to the epithelial compartment and the resulting extracellular matrices . In contrast , in Twirler mice , multiple cells expressing α-tectorin , Otogelin and Oc90 were found within the non-epithelial compartment , often in clusters ( Figure 6C ) .\nIn this study we developed a protocol to isolate the major cell types of the auditory and vestibular organs of newborn wild type mouse inner ears . We applied this approach to characterize the tissue- and cell type–specific transcriptome of the newborn mouse inner ear , followed by a computational analysis to identify co-expressed genes and regulators of cell fate . The cis-regulatory motif analysis was carried out using a de novo motif discovery tool with no bias to any pre-selected TFs [18] . Searching all possible DNA motifs , the analysis defined only two statistically significant motifs , corresponding to ZEB1/2 ( enriched in promoters of genes whose expression was reduced in sensory cells ) and c-Ets-1/2 ( enriched in promoters of genes whose expression was elevated in blood cells ) . Most of the reported successful analyses using similar approaches were achieved in lower organisms ( primarily yeast ) in which transcriptional regulation is much simpler [27] , [28] . Additional regulators are likely to be identified by sorting the cell types we studied to even more homogeneous subpopulations ( e . g . separating hair cells from supporting cells ) . The strength of this approach is further demonstrated by the ability to detect not only compartment specific regulators of cell fate ( Zeb1/2 , c-Ets1/2 , miR-128 , miR-9 and miR200b ) but also miR-96 , a miRNA which is expressed only in a subset of the sensory epithelial cells . A recent study by Lewis et al . identified putative targets of miR-96 by comparing expression profiles of whole auditory sensory tissues dissected from wild type and miR-96 mutant mice [12] . Interestingly , the miR-96 putative targets identified by Lewis et al . and by our study represent two non-overlapping groups . Further analysis of the cell type–specific expression patterns of these putative targets reveals that while most of the targets identified by Lewis et al . are elevated and co-expressed with miR-96 in the same cell population ( sensory epithelium ) , our analysis identified targets whose expression is reduced in the sensory epithelium ( Figure 7 ) . This is consistent with the two functional effects of repression of targets by miRNAs: repression of leaky transcription , and buffering of transcriptional noise [29] . In the first case , the miRNA and its targets are expressed in mutually exclusive cell types . In the second case , the miRNA functions to reduce fluctuation in the expression of its target due to transcriptional noise , and therefore it is co-expressed with its targets in the same cells . Since miR-96 is expressed in the inner-ear specifically in hair cells and as the hair cells consist of only a small fraction of the total number of cells in this organ , only targets that are hair cell-specific or hair cell-enriched ( and hence targets that belong to the second group ) are likely to be detected when extracting RNA from intact sensory tissues ( for example , tissues that consists of a mix of epithelial and non-epithelial cells , or a mix of hair cells and supporting cells ) as was done by Lewis et al . For the other group of targets , the effect of miR-96 is expected to be diluted by their expression in the other inner-ear compartments . On the other hand , in our study , using a cell type–specific analysis of wild-type inner ears , we could only identify targets of miR-96 that are expressed also outside the sensory epithelial cells ( and hence targets that belong to the first group ) . We hypothesize that repeating the experiment described by Lewis et al . using a cell type–specific approach would likely identify both groups of complementary target genes . We applied our method to analyze ears from Twirler mutant mice to determine if the observed inner ear malformations were associated with a disruption of wild-type cell type–specific gene expression profiles . The results revealed misregulation of epithelial and mesenchymal specific genes in the non-epithelial compartment . This finding is consistent with a misregulation of Zeb1-regulated gene expression in the Twirler mutant mice . Furthermore , a group of genes that encodes the extracellular matrices of the mouse inner ear – Otog , Tecta , Tectb and Oc-90- was upregulated in the non-epithelial cells of the homozygous Twirler inner ears and harbored a binding site for Zeb1 in their promoter , suggesting that they are direct targets of the Zeb1 transcription factor in the developing inner ear mesenchyme . Of note , immunohistochemical analysis of inner ears from Zeb1-null mice [30] and their heterozygous or wild type littermate controls showed very subtle , if any , structural abnormalities in the ears of the Zeb1-null mice ( Data not shown ) . It is possible that Zeb2 may compensate for the loss of Zeb1 in Zeb1-null but not Tw/Tw inner ear mesenchyme . This is consistent with the observation that Tw is not a loss-of-function allele of Zeb1 [24] . The expression profiles of Twirler ears suggest that a pathologic disruption of epithelial and mesenchymal cell identities underlies the inner ear malformations observed in the Twirler mouse mutant , consistent with misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway . This could arise from a loss of mesenchymal cell identity leading to mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( MET ) , a loss of epithelial cell identity leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , or a combination of these mechanisms . The exact mechanism leading to the misregulation of the ZEB1 pathway is still unknown , but likely results from loss of binding of one or more Myb proteins to a binding site disrupted by the Twirler Zeb1 mutation [24] . Therefore , further work is required in order to elucidate the exact mechanism of the Twirler mutation . A limitation of our approach is the utilization of CD326 to separate the epithelial from the non-epithelial compartment in the Twirler mutant mice , as CD326 itself could be regulated by Zeb1 . Nevertheless , we were unable to identify other epithelial markers with a stable pattern of expression to separate epithelial and non-epithelial cells . Ultimately , to prove direct regulation of gene expression by transcription factors , one has to demonstrate protein-DNA interactions . This is specifically challenging when working with tissues or small organs such as the inner ear sensory epithelia . Future development of techniques to perform large-scale whole transcriptome analysis of protein-DNA interactions using small numbers of cells will enable combining cell type–specific approaches with techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing ( ChIP-Seq ) [31] . Finally , implementation of our approach to study other mouse models for hearing loss will likely shed light on the molecular mechanisms downstream and upstream of many of the deafness genes .\nAll procedures involving animals were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and have been approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Maryland , Baltimore ( protocols 0107005 and 1209008 ) or the joint Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders . Wild type ICR mice were obtained as time-mated animals from Charles River Laboratories ( Maryland ) . Newborn mice were euthanized by decapitation . Whole inner ears were micro-dissected out of the middle cranial fossa following the contour of their cartilaginous capsule , in a 3-cm dish with cold PBS . The tissue was then fixed in 2–4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in PBS for 4 hours or overnight at 4°C . Cryoprotection was performed in a sucrose gradient ( 5% , 10% , 15% , 20% , 25% in PBS ) , 30 minutes in each step . The tissue was then kept at 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4°C . The following day , tissue was embedded in optimal cutting temperature ( O . C . T . ) compound ( Tissue-Tek ) and positioned with the lateral aspect of the basal turn of the cochlea at a 90° angle to the surface of a small plastic receptacle . The tissue was then frozen at this position using dry ice and kept in a −80°C freezer until further use . Five-to 7-µm sections were obtained using a Leica CM1850 cryostat and placed on superfrost/Plus slides ( Fisherbrand ) . Sections were kept at −80°C until further use . For immunofluorescence the slides were brought to room temperature and a liquid-repellent marker pen ( Daido Sangyo ) was used to circle the sections . After a 30-min wash with PBS and 0 . 5% Tween-20 , sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum ( NGS ) for 20 min at room temperature . Primary antibody incubation was performed for one hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C . Following three 5-min washes , sections were incubated for 45 minutes with a goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody conjugated either to Alexa Fluor 488 or 546 at room temperature , in the dark . Slides were then washed two times in PBS , cell nuclei were stained by 10-min incubation with DAPI 1 µg/ml ( KPL ) and mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Sections were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse E600 upright microscope equipped for brightfield and fluorescence . Images were acquired using a SPOT Diagnostics image acquisition system . Hair cells were counterstained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody for Myosin VI ( Proteus Biosciences ) at 1∶1000 dilution . The following rat monoclonal antibodies were used to detect CD proteins: Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse CD326 ( Ep-CAM ) 1∶100 , PE anti-mouse CD34 ( 1∶200 ) and FITC anti-human/mouse CD49f ( 1∶200 ) ( BioLegend ) . The following antibodies were also used to detect their respective proteins: anti-Zeb1 rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 1∶1000 ) ( Spoelstra et al . , 2006 ) , anti-OC90 ( 1∶200 ) [32] , anti-Otog ( 1∶1000 ) [33] ( gifts from Dr . Christine Petit ) and anti-tectorin-α ( 1∶1000 ) [34] ( a gift from Dr . Guy P . Richardson ) . Alexa fluor 488 and 546 goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used for secondary detection ( 1∶1000 ) ( Molecular Probes ) and Alexa fluor 546 phalloidin ( 1∶300 ) was used to stain actin . Auditory and vestibular tissues with their underlying mesenchyme were harvested from P0-P1 mouse inner ears and collected in 2 cm plastic dishes . The auditory epithelium consisted of the organ of Corti as dissected for a standard explant culture [35] . The vestibular epithelia consisted of the saccule , utricle and three cristae ampullaris , with a varying amount of semicircular canal epithelium . The tissue was then incubated with 0 . 5 mg/ml thermolysin ( Sigma ) in 25 mM Hepes medium for 20 minutes in a 37°C/5%CO2 humidified tissue culture incubator , for partial digestion of the extracellular matrix . The thermolysin was then aspirated and the epithelia were incubated with Accutase enzyme cell detachment medium ( eBioscience ) for 3 min in a standard tissue culture incubator followed by mechanical disruption of the tissue using a 23G blunt ended needle connected to a 1ml syringe , and then by another cycle of a 3-min incubation and mechanical disruption . Cellular dissociation was confirmed by direct visualization using an inverted tissue culture microscope . The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of complete medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 1% Hepes and 1% Glutamax in DMEM ( no antibiotics ) . Cells were passed through a 40-µm cell strainer ( BD ) and washed in PBS . Cells were counted and viability was assessed using Trypan blue exclusion ( Sigma ) . Usually less than 2% of the cells stained positive for Trypan blue . The dissociated cells were then stained with CD326-APC ( 1∶2 , 000 ) , CD49f-alexa488 ( 1∶100 ) and CD34-PE ( 1∶200 ) ( Biolegend ) diluted in FACS buffer ( PBS , 5% fetal calf serum ) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark followed by a wash in FACS buffer . The cells were then sorted using a Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDB flow cytometer and cell sorter or BD FACSARIA Cell Sorter ( BD Biosciences ) . A small amount of cells from each population was routinely re-analyzed by performing a second pass through the sorter to evaluate the purity of the sorted cells . For the analysis of epithelial and non-epithelial gene expression in the Twirler mutant mice and their littermate controls , inner ears from newborn mice were dissected and dissociated as described . The cells were then stained with the antibody for CD326 in order to sort the cells into the epithelial and non-epithelial compartments . For cell sorting of auditory and vestibular epithelia of newborn Tw/Tw , Tw/+ and +/+ mice ( six , two and six ears , respectively ) were dissected as described above . Due to the structural changes in the cochlear epithelia of the homozygous mutant mice , the cochlear dissection for this set of experiments included the entire cochlear duct ( including the scala vestibuli and scala tympani ) to guarantee consistency in the dissections . Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plus Micro Kit ( Qiagen ) . Real time RT-PCR for CD326 , CD49f and CD34 was performed as previously described [4] . Experiments were performed as two biologically independent replicates , with each biological experiment consisting of total RNA that was extracted from cells collected from at least 20 ears . Results were normalized to the expression of each gene in the cochlear neuronal cells . Whole-genome mouse mRNA expression profiles were recorded using the Illumina Bead Array system and MouseRef-6 v2 . 0 Expression BeadChips . These arrays contain more than 45K probes which collectively interrogate all RefSeq annotated mouse genes ( >26K genes ) and ∼ 7K RefSeq predicted genes . Ten to 20 ng of total RNA were used as starting material . Total RNA was pre-amplified with the Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 ( NuGEN ) . The A total of 1 . 5 µg of cDNA was then processed and labeled following the manufacturer's protocol . 1 . 5 µg of labeled cDNA were used for hybridization . Total RNA and cDNA were quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) and labeled cDNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ( Thermo Scientific ) prior to hybridization . Samples from the sorted populations of wild type mice were obtained and processed from three biologically independent experiments . The whole genome expression profiling of the Twirler mice was performed as a single repeat . Expression profiles were recorded from eight cellular populations ( four cell-types: sensory epithelial , neuronal , vascular endothelial and mesenchymal , isolated from two inner ear organs: the cochlea and the vestibular system ) in triplicates using Illumina Mouse WG6v2 BeadChip arrays . Expression levels were calculated using Illumina's Bead-Studio package . Probes not readily detected in the dataset were filtered out using detection p-values assigned by Bead-Studio to each measurement and requiring that each probe be detected ( p-value<0 . 01 ) in at least two samples . This criterion left 16 , 983 probes for subsequent analyses . Arrays were then normalized using quantile normalization . Expression data were then analyzed using the EXPANDER package [36] . Hierarchical clustering of the samples contained all the 16 , 983 expressed probes in the dataset and used the average-linkage method . Differentially expressed genes in the dataset were identified using two-way ANOVA analysis with a stringent p-value cutoff of 10-5 . 3 , 167 probes were significantly affected by either factor ( cell-type or organ ) or showed significant interaction between these two factors ( i . e . different cell-type expression patterns between the two organs ) . Main expression patterns exhibited by the set of differentially expressed genes were detected by cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm . Prior to clustering , the expression level of each probe was standardized to mean = 0 and SD = 1 . Enriched Gene Ontology ( GO ) categories in the clusters were sought using the TANGO algorithm implemented in EXPANDER . As clustering inherently generates a noisy division of probes and genes according to their expression patterns , we also defined more homogenous sets of cell-type specific markers . The set of marker genes of each cell-type included all the genes whose minimal expression level in the samples of that cell-type was at least 50% higher than its expression across all the rest of the samples . The expression patterns obtained by this division of genes were similar to those obtained by the clustering analysis ( Figure S4 and Table S5 ) . Identification of sets of genes which both 1 ) share similar expression patterns across the cell types in our dataset and 2 ) are physically connected in the cellular protein-protein interaction web , was carried out using the MATISSE algorithm [10] which is implemented in the EXPANDER package . Over-represented cis-regulatory sequence motifs in promoter regions ( −1000 to +200 nt relative to transcription start site ( TSS ) ) of the sets of cell-type marker genes were searched using AMADEUS [18] . The entire set of promoters of genes expressed in the dataset served as the background set in this analysis . miRNA activity was statistically sought by comparing , for each miRNA family and in each cell-type , the relative expression levels between the set of predicted targets of the miRNA and the background set containing all the rest of genes [14] . Significant down-regulation of predicted targets of a particular miRNA in a particular cell population suggests that the activity of the miRNA itself is enhanced in those cells . Predicted miRNA targets were obtained from TargetScanS [37] . Prior to carrying out these tests , the expression level of each gene was normalized to its average level across the eight conditions in our dataset to obtain relative levels . A list of cloned human deafness-related genes and deafness loci for which the underlying gene was not cloned yet was compiled from the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage ( http://hereditaryhearingloss . org/ ) . Human genes located within deafness loci were extracted using a Perl script . Mouse homologues of these genes were found using NCBI's HomoloGene [38] . Expression data were downloaded from Array-Express DB , quantile normalized and averaged over replicates . Expression ratios were then calculated between mean levels in the miR-96 mutant and wild-type samples . Whole-mount in-situ hybridization was performed with probes mmu-miR-182 and mmu-miR-200b ( Exiqon ) to detect miRNA-182 and 200b , respectively , as previously described [39] . No-probe experiments were performed as negative controls .",
         "The mammalian inner ear is a highly complex sensory organ , and mutations in more than 100 genes underlie hereditary human non-syndromic hearing loss . Nevertheless , little is known about the signaling cascades downstream of deafness genes . Genome-wide expression profiling is an invaluable tool for gaining systems-level understanding of biological processes . We developed and validated a simple and novel protocol to isolate sensory epithelial cells , neurons , blood vessels , and mesenchyme of auditory and vestibular epithelia from newborn wild-type mice . Our protocol is based on flow cytometry to sort and capture cells labeled with commercially available antibodies to endogenously expressed cluster of differentiation ( CD ) antigens . Using this strategy , we identified Zeb1 and miR200b as regulators of epithelial and mesenchymal identity in the mouse inner ear , and we further identified the signaling pathway disrupted by the Zeb1 mutation in the Twirler mouse mutant . We also show the utility of this approach for characterizing compartment-specific genes and protein–protein networks . Implementation of this isolation strategy to study other mouse mutants with hearing and balance phenotypes could overcome many of the obstacles to understanding the function of deafness genes .",

         "MBT domain proteins are involved in developmental processes and tumorigenesis . In vitro binding and mutagenesis studies have shown that individual MBT domains within clustered MBT repeat regions bind mono- and dimethylated histone lysine residues with little to no sequence specificity but discriminate against the tri- and unmethylated states . However , the exact function of promiscuous histone methyl-lysine binding in the biology of MBT domain proteins has not been elucidated . Here , we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans four MBT domain protein LIN-61 , in contrast to other MBT repeat factors , specifically interacts with histone H3 when methylated on lysine 9 , displaying a strong preference for di- and trimethylated states ( H3K9me2/3 ) . Although the fourth MBT repeat is implicated in this interaction , H3K9me2/3 binding minimally requires MBT repeats two to four . Further , mutagenesis of residues conserved with other methyl-lysine binding MBT regions in the fourth MBT repeat does not abolish interaction , implicating a distinct binding mode . In vivo , H3K9me2/3 interaction of LIN-61 is required for C . elegans vulva development within the synMuvB pathway . Mutant LIN-61 proteins deficient in H3K9me2/3 binding fail to rescue lin-61 synMuvB function . Also , previously identified point mutant synMuvB alleles are deficient in H3K9me2/3 interaction although these target residues that are outside of the fourth MBT repeat . Interestingly , lin-61 genetically interacts with two other synMuvB genes , hpl-2 , an HP1 homologous H3K9me2/3 binding factor , and met-2 , a SETDB1 homologous H3K9 methyl transferase ( H3K9MT ) , in determining C . elegans vulva development and fertility . Besides identifying the first sequence specific and di-/trimethylation binding MBT domain protein , our studies imply complex multi-domain regulation of ligand interaction of MBT domains . Our results also introduce a mechanistic link between LIN-61 function and biology , and they establish interplay of the H3K9me2/3 binding proteins , LIN-61 and HPL-2 , as well as the H3K9MT MET-2 in distinct developmental pathways .\nProteins containing MBT ( malignant brain tumor ) domains potentially act as tumor suppressors and might modulate gene repression in the context of chromatin . The MBT repeat is a highly conserved structural motif of ca . 100 amino acids that is found from C . elegans to humans and that exists as tandem repeats of two to four elements [1] . Three linearly arranged MBT domains were first identified in the gene corresponding to the Drosophila lethal ( 3 ) malignant brain tumor ( l ( 3 ) mbt ) mutant , an embryonic lethal mutation associated with malignant transformations of optic neuroblasts [2] , [3] . In flies , only two other MBT domain-containing proteins exist , Sex comb on midleg ( Scm , containing two MBT domains ) and Sex comb with four MBT domains ( Sfmbt ) . Both are members of Polycomb group related complexes implicated in repression of Hox genes [4] , [5] . Like L ( 3 ) mbt , Sfmbt and Scm are essential for Drosophila embryonic development [5]–[7] . In mammals , there are at least nine MBT repeat proteins , each containing two ( SCMH1 , SCML2 ) , three ( L3MBTL1 , L3MBTL3 , L3MBTL4 ) or four ( L3MBTL2 , MBTD1 , SFMBT1 , SFMBT2 ) MBT repeats , respectively . Disruption of scmh1 , l3mbtl1 or l3mbtl in mouse germline has only minor effects , indicating possible redundant and overlapping effects [8]–[10] . Nevertheless , L3MBTL3 , L3MBTL2 and SCML2 are mutated in rare cases of medulloblastoma , indicating that MBT domain proteins may be tumor suppressors [11] . In agreement , mammalian MBT domain proteins function as transcriptional repressors in different contexts , for example when directly targeted to transcriptional reporter systems via heterologous DNA binding domains or on the cyclin E promoter [12] , [13] . For this function , the MBT domains appear essential [14] . MBT domain proteins in flies and human contain additional domains besides MBT repeats , such as Zn fingers and SPM regions . In contrast , the two C . elegans MBT domain proteins , LIN-61 and MBTR-1 are composed almost completely of four MBT repeats ( for review see [1] ) . While the function of mbtr-1 is unknown , lin-61 was recently implicated in the synMuvB pathway of C . elegans vulva development [15] , [16] . Here , simultaneous mutation of individual genes within two groups , synMuvA and synMuvB , causes formation of additional vulva like protrusions on the ventral side of the worm ( multivulva , Muv phenotype ) ( for review see [17] ) . While a large number of chromatin factors are classified as synMuvB , the exact molecular roles of these factors within C . elegans developmental pathways have not been defined . Diverse post-translational modifications ( PTM ) of histone proteins play important roles in regulating chromatin states and thereby the use and readout of the genome . Especially , methylation of distinct histone lysine residues provides a large array of regulatory options , as these confer site ( position of the modified lysine in the primary sequence ) and modification stage ( mono- vs . di- . vs . trimethylation ) specific effects [18] . This has been shown , for example , for activating methyl-lysine marks H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4me ) and H3 lysine 36 ( H3K36me ) , where different methylation states are associated with distinct roles in the transcription cycle ( for review see [19] ) . Methylation of H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9me ) , in contrast , has been largely studied in the context of gene silencing , especially within heterochromatin . While the di- and trimethylated states of this mark ( H3K9me2/3 ) mainly localize to repressed regions of the genome , these have also been found associated with the body of transcribed genes [20] , [21] . H3K9me1 , in contrast , shows a more euchromatic distribution [22] , [23] . Differential and site-specific histone lysine methylation is established by distinct histone methyl-transferases ( HKMT ) . Di- and trimethylation of H3K9 are mediated by the Suv39h1/h2 isoenzymes , CLLD8/KMT1F as well as the ESET/SETDB1 histone methyltransferase [24]–[26] . SETDB1 is mainly found in euchromatic regions , where it participates in gene silencing [27] . In contrast , CLLD8/KMT1F and Suv39-like enzymes localize to pericentromeric heterochromatin [26] . While all putative HMTs of C . elegans were analyzed for function within the synMuv pathways , only the met-1 and met-2 genes genetically interact with synMuvA factors [28] . While MET-1 appears to methylate H3K36 , met-2 encodes a SETDB1 homologous H3K9MT . Besides function in vulva cell fate determination , recent work has shown that MET-2 is required for all germline H3K9me2 [29] . A number of proteins have been identified that specifically interact with histone methyl-lysine residues . These include chromodomain- , PHD finger- , tudor domain- and ankyrin domain-containing chromatin factors . In vitro , proteins containing these domains show significant site specificity in binding to distinct histone methyl-lysine marks . Also , clear preference for either higher ( me2/me3 ) or lower ( me1/me2 ) methylation states are observed . For example , heterochromatin protein 1 ( HP1 ) binds H3K9me3- and H3K9me2-containing peptides preferentially over H3K9me0 and H3K9me1 targets . Also , discrimination against other sites of lysine methylation , even when in similar sequence context such as H3K27me ( both H3K9 and H3K27 reside within an “ARKS” sequence patch ) , is observed [30] . Interestingly , one of the two HP1 orthologs in C . elegans , HPL-2 is classified as a synMuvB factor [31] . The other ortholog , HPL-1 seems to act as an enhancer of HPL-2 in this and other developmental pathways [32] . Colocalization of binding factors with cognate histone PTMs on a global scale by immunofluorescence studies or on a local scale by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments have suggested that PTM recognition might be a common targeting mechanisms of chromatin factors [33] . Also , recognition of multiple histone PTMs in the context of higher order complexes of binding factors might directly affect chromatin structure , inducing higher order chromatin folds [13] , [34] . However , the exact working mechanisms of many histone modification binding proteins , their recruitment , and their downstream actions have not been fully elucidated . MBT domains constitute a separate class of histone methyl-lysine reading modules that seem not to have high selectivity for their target sites . In vitro , diverse MBT domain regions from different proteins and organisms display specificity for mono- and dimethylated lysine residues over the unmodified and trimethylated states . However , site discrimination and specificity for selected sites is very low [1] , [5] , [12] , [35]–[39] . These findings are complemented by structural studies that have implemented three aromatic caging residues and an aspartate moiety in methyl-lysine binding . In this “cavity insertion mode , ” there is little contribution of protein surface residues in histone sequence recognition [35]–[41] . Interestingly , only individual MBT domains within multiple MBT repeat-containing elements are implicated in histone methyl-lysine binding [12] , [35] , [36] . In this sense , the biological role and functional implications of the other MBT repeats within the linearly arranged MBT regions are unclear . MBT domain proteins might exert higher specificity for particular histone methyl-lysine PTMs in vivo as suggested by indirect targeting experiments [12] . While it is clear that MBT domain proteins contribute to the complex organization of chromatin as readers and effectors of histone PTMs that is critical for the establishment of specific cellular differentiation states [33] , [34] , [42] , the exact contribution of methyl-lysine binding activity to the biology of these proteins has not been worked out . Here , we show that C . elegans LIN-61 specifically interacts with H3K9me2/3 . Sequence homology and mutagenesis studies imply the fourth MBT repeat in this interaction . However , a minimum of three C-terminal MBT repeats is required for H3K9me2/3 binding and analysis of previously identified lin-61 point mutant alleles indicates complex conformational regulation of ligand interaction of LIN-61 MBT domains . We find that in vivo H3K9me2/3 binding of LIN-61 is necessary for C . elegans vulva development within the synMuvB pathway . We also demonstrate that lin-61 genetically interacts with hpl-2 , an HP1 ortholog H3K9me2/3 binding factor and met-2 , an H3K9 methyl transferase in determining C . elegans vulva development and fertility .\nWe used peptide affinity purification experiments to identify binding partners of H3K9me3 in C . elegans extracts . Besides other factors , LIN-61 and MBTR-1 were identified in MS analysis of proteins bound to H3K9me3 peptides compared to the H3K9me0 control ( Figure S1A-S1C ) . Both proteins share the same four MBT domain overall structure and are 40% identical in sequence ( Figure S1D ) . We raised antibodies specific for LIN-61 ( Figure S2D ) and confirmed this finding using a panel of lysine methylated histone peptides in affinity purification experiments . As Figure 1A shows , LIN-61 from C . elegans extracts interacted preferentially with the H3K9me3 peptide compared to the H3K9me1 peptide . No interaction with the H3K9me0 peptide was found under these conditions . Binding to H3K9me was specific as no binding to H3K4me3- , H3K27me3- , H3K36me3- or H4K20me3-containing peptides was observed . In contrast and as was previously found [12] , the recombinant MBT domains of human L3MBTL1 bound to the monomethylated forms of all tested histone methyl-lysine sites with little to no sequence preference in the same assay ( Figure 1A ) . Additional experiments showed that LIN-61 binds to H3K9me2 equally well as to H3K9me3 ( Figure 1B ) . HP1 proteins in different model systems have been described as major H3K9me3 interacting chromatin factors . On the basis of immunofluorescence experiments , it was nevertheless suggested that HPL-2 , one of the two C . elegans HP1 orthologous factors might not be a direct binding protein of H3K9me3 [43] . We detected HPL-2 in affinity purification experiments of C . elegans extracts using H3K9me peptides . We found slight preference for the trimethlated over the monomethylated form and discrimination against the unmodified template ( Figure 1A ) . To exclude indirect binding of LIN-61 to H3K9me2/3 via bridging interaction by the C . elegans HPL-1 and HPL-2 HP1 proteins , we repeated the affinity purification experiments using extracts prepared from hpl-1 and hpl-2 mutant worms . LIN-61 was recovered on H3K9me3 peptide-containing beads under these conditions comparable to the wild type situation ( Figure 1C ) . Further , we purified recombinant MBP-LIN-61 fusion protein after expression in bacteria . In affinity purification experiments , the recombinant LIN-61 protein showed strong preference for the H3K9me3 peptide over H3K4 , H3K27 , H3K36 , H3K64 and H4K20 trimethylated peptides and for the trimethylated H3K9 site over the monomethylated form reminiscent of the endogenous C . elegans protein ( Figure 1D and Figure S1E ) . Also , in vitro translated LIN-61 and MBTR-1 proteins specifically bound H3K9me3 ( Figure S1F and S1G ) . Only H3K9me3 peptide but not H3K9me0 , H4K20me0 or H4K20me3 peptides was able to compete with the binding of recombinant LIN-61 to the immobilized H3K9me3 target ( Figure 1E ) . From these experiments we conclude that the C . elegans MBT domain protein LIN-61 specifically and autonomously interacts with H3K9me . In contrast to other MBT proteins that display little to no sequence specific methyl-lysine binding and that discriminate against the tri-methylated state , LIN-61 shows preference for the di- and tri-methylated states of the H3K9 site . Alignment of LIN-61 with other MBT domain proteins , dScm [35] , hL3MBTL1 [37] , dSfmbt [5] , [36] , hL3MBTL2 [41] and hMBTD1 [40] indicated that only the fourth MBT repeat of LIN-61 contains all three aromatic caging residues and the aspartate moiety that have been implicated in methyl-lysine binding of other MBT repeats ( Figure 2A and 2B ) . From the structural insights available from these MBT domain proteins , we predicted that LIN-61 MBT domain four is involved in H3K9me3 peptide interaction . To characterize the H3K9me binding of LIN-61 , we first analyzed a series of mutant recombinant GST-fusion proteins where different MBT repeats were deleted ( Figure 2C ) . In peptide affinity purification experiments we found the first MBT repeat of LIN-61 dispensable for H3K9me interaction . When additional MBT repeats were deleted , neither truncated LIN-61 protein corresponding to MBT repeats three and four nor truncated LIN-61 protein corresponding to MBT repeats two and three bound the H3K9me3 peptide . Also , none of the individual MBT repeats showed any interaction . Next , we analyzed a series of LIN-61 proteins with point mutations in conserved residues in MBT domain four . In other factors , these residues were implicated in MBT repeat methyl-lysine binding . To this end , affinity purifications were carried out with in vitro translated MYC-tagged LIN-61 proteins ( Figure 2D ) . Mutation of the highly conserved aspartate residue ( LIN-61 D428A ) caused reduced binding , but did not abolish interaction . This finding is in stark contrast to other MBT domain protein interaction with mono- and dimethylated histone lysine residues where the corresponding residue is absolutely required [35]–[37] . In agreement with an aromatic cage in MBT domain four being involved in H3K9me3 binding , simultaneous mutation of three conserved aromatic residues in LIN-61 MBT domain four ( LIN-61 F452A/W455A/F459A ) completely abolished H3K9me3 interaction . However , we found only two of these residues , W455 and F459 , essential for methyl-lysine binding , whereas F452 was not necessary for interaction . We conclude that MBT domain four of LIN-61 is likely directly involved in H3K9me3 binding . The results suggest that the overall structure of the three MBT repeats two to four is essential for this interaction . In general , LIN-61 binding to methyl-lysine residues appears to be different from other MBT repeat-containing methyl-lysine binding factors . To analyze the biological role of LIN-61 H3K9me2/3 binding , we obtained a deletion mutant worm strain from the National BioResource Project . Analysis of this strain , lin-61 ( tm2649 ) indicated loss of a 672 bp fragment spanning from the middle of exon two to exon four ( Figure S2A ) . While shortened mRNA could be detected by reverse transcription PCR analysis ( Figure S2B ) , Western blotting using two different antibodies directed against an N- terminal region of LIN-61 or the full-length recombinant protein verified that lin-61 ( tm2649 ) is a protein null mutant allele ( Figure S2D and S2E ) . In agreement with previous observations on lin-61 mutant C . elegans , lin-61 ( tm2649 ) did not have any apparent phenotype on the level of the organism [15] . We also did not detect profound changes on a cellular level , and the global degree of H3K9me2/3 was unchanged ( data not shown ) . Nevertheless , congruent with the earlier studies , we detected a synMuv phenotype for lin-61 ( Figure 3A and 3B ) . Only when individual members of two sets of genes , synMuvA and synMuvB , in the C . elegans vulva development pathway are simultaneously mutated is a multivulva ( Muv ) phenotype observed . Individual synMuvA or SynMuvB gene mutation does not cause a phenotype . lin-61 ( tm2649 ) in the background of lin-15A ( n767 ) , a synMuvA gene , caused extra ventral protrusions ( pseudovulvae ) in 78 . 3% of worms at 20°C and in 99 . 9% of worms at 24 . 5°C . Similarly , RNAi knockdown of the lin-15A gene product in lin-61 ( tm2649 ) C . elegans caused a Muv phenotype with a frequency of 94 . 0% at 24 . 5°C ( Table 1 ) . These finding confirm lin-61 as a synMuvB gene . To analyze whether H3K9me3 binding is essential for LIN-61 function within the synMuv pathway , we injected a genomic lin-61 DNA fragment into lin-61 ( tm2649 ) ; lin-15A ( n767 ) C . elegans ( Figure 3C ) . In seven independent C . elegans lines , we observed significant rescue of the Muv phenotype where the individual lines displayed a residual frequency of worms containing pseudovulvaes from 12 . 1% to 35 . 8% . In contrast , injection of the same genomic DNA fragment carrying the F452A/W455A/F459A triple mutation that abolished LIN-61–H3K9me3 interaction did not rescue the Muv phenotype at all . In four independent C . elegans lines , we observed Muv phenotypes with a frequency close to 100% . Importantly , Western blot analysis of transgene expression in several of the C . elegans lines verified that the exogenous lin-61 wild type and mutant gene copies were expressed to levels comparable to those in wild type worms ( Figure 3D ) . A number of lin-61 point mutant alleles with synMuv phenotypes have been described [15] . While some of these mutants show significantly reduced expression levels ( n3807 , n3922 ) others have diminished ( n3624 , n3736 ) or wild type LIN-61 content ( n3447 ) [15] . We expressed the corresponding mutant proteins in an in vitro translation system and tested their interaction with H3K9me3 peptides in affinity purification experiments ( for a map of the mutants see Figure 2B ) . As Figure 3E shows , the G445R ( within MBT domain four ) and G250F ( within MBT domain two ) mutant proteins encoded by the lin-61 ( n3922 ) and lin-61 ( n3807 ) alleles did not bind to H3K9me3 . The P132S mutant protein ( within MBT domain one ) encoded by the lin-61 ( n3624 ) allele , in contrast , showed H3K9me3 interaction similar to the wild type factor . The F247S mutant protein ( within MBT domain two ) encoded by the lin-61 ( n3736 ) allele showed somewhat reduced binding . However , the S354N mutant protein ( within MBT domain three ) encoded by the lin-61 ( n3447 ) allele showed significantly reduced H3K9me3 interaction . Considering the expression levels of the mutant proteins , we conclude from these experiments that H3K9me2/3 binding is essential for LIN-61 function in the synMuv pathway and that amino acid residues outside of MBT repeat four are essential for interaction of LIN-61 with H3K9me2/3 . Also , additional protein interactions that map outside the MBT domains two to four , which are required for H3K9me2/3 binding , are likely involved in LIN-61 synMuv function . Only one of the two HP1 orthologous factors in C . elegans , hpl-2 but not hpl-1 is a synMuvB gene [31] . Since we detected both LIN-61 and HPL-2 interacting with H3K9me2/3 , we asked whether these two factors act synergistically in C . elegans vulva cell fate determination . It has been suggested that such genetic enhancement studies can be used to dissect the relationship of genes within biological pathways [44] . In agreement with earlier findings , hpl-2 mutant worms did not show a phenotype at 20°C , but displayed low frequency of Muv phenotype at elevated temperature ( 24 . 5°C ) ( Table 1 ) [32] , [43] . Interestingly , lin-61;hpl-2 double mutant worms showed a very high frequency of Muv phenotype under these conditions in the absence of a synMuvA mutation , indicating strong genetic interaction between these factors within this process ( Figure 4A and Table 1 ) . Importantly , mbtr-1 , which itself is not a synMuvB gene [15] , but whose protein product binds H3K9me2/3 , did not act synergistically either with hpl-2 or lin-61 in these experiments ( see also Figure S2F ) . Also , hpl-1 , which enhances the mild Muv phenotype of hpl-2 observed at elevated temperature [32] , did not synergize with lin-61 . We infer that LIN-61 and HPL-2 might regulate the same target genes in the synMuv pathway , possibly via binding the same H3K9me2/3 regions of the genome . MET-2 is the H3K9MT within the synMuvB pathway . If a linear pathway from MET-2 , which establishes H3K9me2/3 modification on target regions of the genome involved in determining C . elegans vulva cell fate , to LIN-61 , which binds and translates this chromatin mark , exists , then the corresponding genes should show no interaction . Similar to earlier studies [28] , we did not detect worms with pseudovulvaes with considerable frequency for met-2 even at elevated temperature . In context of lin-61;met-2 we found no significant Muv phenotype at 20°C . However , at 24 . 5°C we found 12 . 9% of double mutant worms containing peseudovulvaes indicating a weak but robust genetic interaction of lin-61 and met-2 . The results indicate that met-2 is not only upstream of lin-61 , but also acts to some degree parallel to this gene in determining C . elegans vulva cell fate . LIN-61 is globally distributed and shows chromatin association in adult worms and focal distribution in embryos [15] . Therefore , the synMuv pathway represents only part of LIN-61 biology . In addition , several synMuvB genes have been found to interact with hpl-2 [28] , [31] , [43] . hpl-1 also enhances the frequency of C . elegans with pseudovulvaes . As hpl-2 might therefore be a special synMuvB gene displaying pleiotropic effects [28] , we wanted to test whether lin-61 and hpl-2 interact beyond the synMuv pathway . As both , HPL-2 and MET-2 have been implied in germ line development [29] , [31] , [32] , we investigated whether LIN-61 also synergizes with these factors in determining C . elegans fertility and brood size . In agreement with earlier findings , hpl-2 mutation caused some sterility of worms ( 13% ) that was enhanced at higher temperature ( 25% at 24 . 5°C , Table 2 ) [31] , [32] . For lin-61 C . elegans , we detected only very low sterility at elevated temperature ( 2% at 24 . 5°C compared to 0% at 20°C ) . However , lin61;hpl-2 double mutant worms showed 22% sterility at 20°C and 98% sterility at 24 . 5°C , indicating strong interaction . These effects were not caused by general loss of germ cells but were due to enhancement of the defects observed for hpl-2 worms [31] . While 1% of hpl-2 worms had no oocytes and 2% displayed failures in gonad elongation , 32% showed defects in oocyte maturation or fertilization ( n = 88 ) . In contrast , 35% of lin61;hpl-2 double mutant worms had no oocytes , 25% displayed failures in gonad elongation and 22% showed defects in oocyte maturation or fertilization at 24 . 5°C ( n = 113 , Figure 4B ) . Importantly , no synergism between mbtr-1 and lin-61 or hpl-2 in causing C . elegans sterility was observed . Similar to the results of the Muv analysis , we also detected some – albeit weaker – synergism between lin-61 and met-2 , which itself brought about only a mild phenotype under the conditions tested , in causing sterility of C . elegans , ( Table 2 ) [29] . Observations analogous to those made when evaluating C . elegans sterility were made when analyzing the brood size of mutant worms ( Figure 4C and 4D ) . lin-61 caused mild but significant reduction in brood size at 20°C and brought about more severe reduction at 24 . 5°C . At both conditions tested , a clear synergism with the brood size reduction of hpl-2 was observed . Similarly , interaction of lin-61 with met-2 was detected in this assay . We conclude that within different pathways of differentiation of somatic cells such as determining C . elegans vulva cell fate and of development of germ cells such as determining C . elegans fertility , the H3K9me2/3 binding proteins LIN-61 and HPL-2 have overlapping functionality by at least partially working in parallel pathways . Similarly , lin-61 and met-2 show some redundancy .\nOur results have two main implications . On one side , they are important for the understanding of MBT protein histone methyl-lysine binding and on the other side they provide molecular insights into the synMuv pathway in C . elegans . Why is LIN-61 ( and MBTR-1 ) binding to H3K9me2/3 highly specific whereas MBT containing proteins of Drosophila and human origin show promiscuous interaction with methyl-lysine residues embedded in different sequence context ? The specific ligands for other MBT domain proteins might not yet have been identified and the analyzed histone methyl-lysine target sites might only be surrogate interaction partners . Yet , in the available structures of MBT domain–ligand complexes , there is very little specific interaction of MBT surfaces with histone sequences . Binding appears largely dependent on unspecific contact of charged interfaces [35]–[41] . Alternatively , interaction might be more specific in cellular context . To this point , binding studies investigating MBT domain behavior have been undertaken with recombinant proteins . In vivo , the MBT proteins of higher eukaryotes might need to be modified or interacting with other factors to allow for sequence specific histone methyl-lysine binding . Along this line , H4K20me1 , but not H3K9me1/2 , recruits hL3MBTL1 in cellular target assays to chromatin , despite the fact that peptides containing these histone marks bind to the recombinant MBT repeats with similar affinities in vitro [12] . Lastly , the methyl-lysine binding mode of LIN-61 might be completely different from other MBT proteins . Mutagenesis of two of three conserved putatively methyl-group caging aromatic residues abolishes LIN-61–H3K9me3 interaction . However , mutagenesis of the third aromatic residue , F452 does not have an effect . Further , mutation of D428 , a highly conserved , charged residue implicated in essential salt bridging and hydrogen bonding of the mono- and dimethylammonium moieties of the methylated lysines in other MBT domain–ligand complexes did not abolish interaction [35]–[37] . A different binding mode is clearly inferred from the fact that LIN-61 prefers the di-and trimethylated states of its target H3K9me residue to the unmodified and mono-methylated forms , whereas other MBT-proteins discriminate against the fully methylated states . Structural studies of Drosophila and human factors have revealed interdigitation of the N-terminal arms of predicted MBT repeats with β-barrel folds of adjacent MBT domains [35]–[41] , [45] . While the exact functional consequence of this overall folding principle of MBT proteins is unclear , expression of the individual MBT repeats of hSCML2 was not possible [46] . We could investigate the individual MBT repeats of LIN-61 , but found them incapable of mediating H3K9me2/3 interaction . We also note that proteins containing only two MBT repeats of the SCM type display about 50- to 100-fold weaker binding to methyl-lysine residues compared to three or four MBT repeat containing factors [5] , [12] , [35]–[39] . Interestingly , four MBT domains of dSfmbt , hL3MBTL2 and hMBTD1 fold into three propeller blade like structures similar to three MBT domain proteins ( hL3MBTL1 [37] , [38] , [45] with the fourth MBT domain stacked atop the planar arrangement [36] , [40] , [41] . Our results on LIN-61 indeed indicate that the first MBT repeat is dispensable for H3K9me2/3 binding . What is it about three MBT domain structures that mediate stable interactions with methyl-lysine ligands ? In the ring form with each domain making contact to two adjacent domains , the individual MBT repeats and especially the single ligand binding domains might be structurally stabilized . Indeed , almost all mutations that cause the malignant phenotype in Drosophila l ( 3 ) mbt or the polycomb phenotype of Scm map to the MBT repeats but not necessarily to the domain that has been implicated in methyl-lysine interaction [4] , [47] . While the corresponding mutant proteins have not yet been explicitly tested in in vitro binding experiments , we show that several single amino acid exchanges in LIN-61 that map outside of MBT repeat four interfere with H3K9me2/3 interaction . Some of these mutations , G445R ( n3922 ) and G250F ( n3807 ) obviously affect overall protein stability as they are detected only at very low levels in mutant C . elegans [15] . However , other mutant LIN-61 proteins , which are expressed to significant ( F247S ( n3736 ) ) or even wild type ( S354N ( n3447 ) ) levels , nevertheless interfere with H3K9me2/3 interaction . While these findings might indicate a composite LIN-61 binding surface with elements of different MBT repeats , they could also point to conformational linkage within the three MBT repeat structures [1] . Slight differences of MBT domain architecture and especially the methyl-lysine binding pockets crystallized under different conditions or in the absence and presence of ligand have been observed [39] , [45] . It remains open whether additional ligands regulate the cross-talk of MBT domains or whether other mechanisms of MBT domain interaction and regulation exist . Structural insights of LIN-61–H3K9me2/3 binding and of mutant LIN-61 proteins are required to better understand not only LIN-61 but also general MBT domain function . Besides the possible implications for the biochemistry of MBT domain-containing proteins , our studies on LIN-61 also involve and further emphasize a significant role for H3K9me in the synMuv pathway of C . elegans vulva cell fate determination . They also stress a role of H3K9me2/3 in germline development . We confirm here that the HP1 homolog synMuvB factor HPL-2 recognizes H3K9 methylation and introduce LIN-61 as novel H3K9me2/3 reader . The high degree of synergy between lin-61 and hpl-2 in vulva cell fate determination and germline development might indicate that these are the only reader proteins in these pathways acting in parallel to translate the effects of H3K9me2/3 . While both factors might act redundantly , binding H3K9me2/3 independently and targeting similar downstream machinery to the same regions of the genome , we also consider a direct interplay between these factors . LIN-61 and HPL-2 might be part of the same multiprotein complex ( es ) . These associations might be transient in the nucleoplasm , as no stable interaction of LIN-61 and HPL-2 was observed in immunoprecipitation experiments [15] . However , these might be stabilized by additional components on the target chromatin regions . While in many instances the H3K9me2/3 binding activity of either HPL-2 or LIN-61 might be sufficient , under conditions of stress ( such as elevated temperature ) both proteins might be necessary to stably anchor effector machinery at certain sites of the genome . It has been proposed that such multivalency binding modes could be crucial to the stable readout of patterns of histone modifications [34] . Earlier work has implied enzymatic activity of MET-2 in the synMuv pathway [28] . It has also been found that this protein in the germline of C . elegans exclusively establishes H3K9me2 [29] . We detect mild but significant genetic interaction of met-2 with lin-61 in determining C . elegans vulva cell fate and in germline development . Such interaction would not be expected in a strictly singular linear writer ( H3K9MT ) – reader ( H3K9me2/3 binding protein ) relationship . Obviously , met-2 is not essential in both pathways of worm development . Other HKMTs can substitute at least partially for MET-2 function . One candidate is met-1 , which has been shown to affect global H3K9me3 to some degree and which is also a synMuvB factor [28] . Another candidate is MES-2 , which in the germline mediates H3K9me3 but does not affect H3K9me2 [29] . Genetic interaction of met-2 and lin-61 might then be due to possible self-reinforcing loops , where H3K9MTs redundant to MET-2 have to be brought to and maintained at target regions via anchoring activity of LIN-61 as an H3K9me binding protein . HPL-2 might only partially be able to substitute for this function , for example if it does not directly interact with the H3K9MTs . Indeed , direct interactions between HKMTs and proteins binding the corresponding histone modifications have been observed in several instances , for example in the case of Suv-39/HP1 [48] and PR-SET7/L3MBTL1 [12] . What are the targets of the MET-2/LIN-61/HPL-2/H3K9me2/3 system ? Penetrance of the Muv phenotype has directly been linked to aberrant , increased expression levels of lin-3 EGF in the hyp7 syncytium , which is secreted and induces abnormal differentiation of additional vulva precursor cells ( VPC ) ( see Figure 3A ) [44] , [49] . Indeed , all three components , lin-61 , hpl-2 and met-2 , have been shown to cause elevated LIN-3 levels in a lin-15A background [28] , [44] . However , the available genome wide mapping data of H3K9me3 do not show enrichment of H3K9me3 at the lin-3 locus [50] . Also , we have failed so far to detect H3K9me2/3 at this region using direct ChIP approaches . Therefore , the mechanisms by which MET-2/LIN-61/HPL-2/H3K9me2/3 regulate lin-3 might be indirect , involving intermediate factors . Since no synMuvA mutation is needed for inducing a Muv phenotype in lin-61;hpl-2 and lin-61;met-2 ( this study ) as well as met-2 hpl-2 [28] double mutant C . elegans , we infer nevertheless that H3K9me2/3 is central in vulva cell fate determination . The results also support a more operational definition of synMuv genes using genetic enhancement tests [44] compared to the original classification where synMuvB mutants are supposed to result in a Muv phenotype only in combination with mutations in the synMuvA pathway , and where factors of one class do not genetically interact [51] . Since LIN-61 is globally distributed in adult worms and embryos [15] , it is clear that this factor has other functionality outside of vulva cell fate determination and germline development . A role in genomic stability has been suggested using an RNAi screening strategy [52] . It remains to be seen whether this and putative other functions of LIN-61 also depend on H3K9me2/3 binding . Since mutation of P132 ( corresponding to the n3624 allele of lin-61 ) does not interfere with H3K9me2/3 interaction and as the n3447 allele is not a very strong synMuv mutant [15] , additional biochemical functions of LIN-61 clearly await discovery .\nCosmid R06C7 was obtained from the Sanger Institute ( UK ) . Plasmids R06C7 . 7 pL4440-Dest-containing cDNA corresponding to LIN-61 and ZK678 . 1 pL4440-Dest-containing cDNA corresponding to LIN-15A were obtained from OpenBiosystems . l3mbtl1pCMV-SPORT6 plasmid containing the cDNA of human L3MBTL1 ( GenBank BC039829 . 1 ) was obtained from Geneservice .

After thawing , bacterial suspensions were passed multiple times through an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer ( Avestin ) . After clarification of extracts ( 40 , 000×g , 15 min , 4°C ) , protein purification was carried out on amylose ( MBP-tagged proteins , NEB ) , Ni-NTA ( His6-tagged proteins , Qiagen ) or GSH resins ( GST-tagged proteins , GE Healthcare ) , according to the manufacturers' protocols . C . elegans was cultivated on NGM plates seeded with E . coli OP50-1 or in liquid S medium containing E . coli HB101 as described [55]–[57] . N2 was the wild type strain . C . elegans strains with the following genotypes were used: LGI: mbtr-1 ( n4775 ) [15] , lin-61 ( tm2649 ) ( National BioResource project ) ; LGIII: met-2 ( n4256 ) [28] , hpl-2 ( tm1489 ) [43]; LGX: hpl-1 ( tm1624 ) [32] , lin-15A ( n767 ) [58] . Single worm PCR was carried out to analyze genotypes ( details of PCR reaction conditions and primers are available upon request ) . Microinjection of C . elegans was performed as described with some modifications [59] . pRF4 plasmid expressing the rol-6 ( su1006 ) allele was used as injection marker at a ratio of 4∶1 compared to linearized ( SacII – PspOMI restriction digest of the pBluescript R06C7 plasmid ) genomic lin-61 DNA fragment . F1 progeny displaying a roller phenotype were singled . Plates were incubated for at least one week until offspring were starved . Individuals with a roller phenotype were transferred to new plates and progeny was analyzed . RNAi feeding experiments were performed as described [60] . C . elegans protein extract was prepared according to Cheeseman et al . with some modifications [61] . ∼ 5 g of frozen C . elegans were grounded using a pre-chilled mortar and pestle in liquid N2 . The grounded worm pellet was supplemented with an equal volume of 2x extraction buffer ( 50 mM HEPES-KOH , 2 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl2 , 200 mM KCl , 20% glycerol , 0 . 1% NP-40 , 2x EDTA-free Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche ) , pH 7 . 4 ) while grounding and then thawed on ice . Grounded worms were sonicated ( Branson ) and extract was clarified by centrifugation ( 50 , 000×g , 60 min , 4°C ) . Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus ( Thermo Scientific ) . For Western blot analysis , a minimum of 50 worms were transferred to an Eppendorf tube and washed with H2O . An equal amount ( w/v ) of nematode solubilization buffer ( 0 . 3% ( v/v ) ethanolamine , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM PMSF , 5 mM DTT ) was added . The sample was sonicated for 20 min in a Bioruptor using 30 s intervals ( Diagenode ) . An equal volume of 2x protein sample buffer was added . After boiling for 5 min , the extract was clarified by centrifugation ( 16 , 000×g , 10 min , 4°C ) . Individual hermaphrodites at larvae stage ( L3 – L4 ) were picked to NGM plates and transferred to fresh NGM plates at successive days . Progeny were counted at larval stage . The mean brood size and standard deviation of a particular strain was calculated and corresponds to the average brood size of all assayed hermaphrodites that were not sterile . Percentage of sterile hermaphrodites ( without offspring ) of particular strains was determined in parallel .",
         "Post-translational modifications ( PTM ) of histones , the proteins around which DNA is wrapped in chromatin , have been implicated in different biological processes ranging from transcriptional regulation to cell cycle progression . Many histone PTMs recruit specific proteins that translate their function into biological outcomes . Understanding the binding mode and molecular biology of these factors is key for our comprehension of epigenetic processes . In this study , we found that the Caenorhabditis elegans LIN-61 protein specifically interacts with particular PTMs on histone H3 , di- and trimethylation of lysine 9 ( H3K9me2/3 ) , which are implicated in transcriptional repression . LIN-61 contains so-called malignant brain tumor repeats ( MBT ) , which have been found to bind histone methyl-lysine residues in other proteins and model systems . However , these interactions are limited to the mono- and dimethylated states , and there is little to no sequence specificity for particular histone lysine residues . Importantly , H3K9me2/3 binding by LIN-61 is essential for the function of this factor within the synMuv pathway of C . elegans vulva cell fate determination . Besides identifying the first sequence and methylation state specific MBT protein , our studies define novel functions of LIN-61 and manifest a role of H3K9me2/3 in the synMuv pathway .",

         "Melioidosis is a problem in the developing tropical regions of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia where the the Gram negative saprophytic bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei is endemic with the risk of fulminant septicaemia . While diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for melioidiosis , little is known if specific hypoglycemic agents may differentially influence the susceptibility and clinical course of infection with B . pseudomallei ( Bp ) . In this cohort study , patients with pre-existing diabetes and melioidosis were retrospectively studied . Outcome measures: mortality , length of stay and development of complications ( namely hypotension , intubation , renal failure and septicaemia ) were studied in relation to prior diabetic treatment regimen . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from diabetic patients and healthy PBMC primed with metformin , glyburide and insulin were stimulated with purified Bp antigens in vitro . Immune response and specific immune pathway mediators were studied to relate to the clinical findings mechanistically . Of 74 subjects , 44 ( 57 . 9% ) had sulphonylurea-containing diabetic regimens . Patient receiving sulphonylureas had more severe septic complications ( 47 . 7% versus 16 . 7% p = 0 . 006 ) , in particular , hypotension requiring intropes ( p = 0 . 005 ) . There was also a trend towards increased mortality in sulphonylurea-users ( 15 . 9% versus 3 . 3% p = 0 . 08 ) . In-vitro , glyburide suppressed inflammatory cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner . An effect of the drug was the induction of IL-1R-associated kinase-M at the level of mRNA transcription . Sulphonylurea treatment results in suppression of host inflammatory response and may put patients at higher risk for adverse outcomes in melioidosis .\nMelioidosis is an environmental saprophyte endemic in tropical regions . The infection is caused by the Gram negative saprophytic bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei found commonly in environmental soil and surface water [1] . Clinical presentations of melioidosis include bacteremia , abscesses in any organ systems , pneumonia or soft tissue infection . The clinical course can be mild and chronic through to fulminant leading to septic shock and death [2] . Diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for susceptibility to melioidosis [3] , [4] . Approximately 50% of patients presenting with melioidosis are diabetics , the majority of whom are already receiving anti-diabetic therapy . However little is known if specific hypoglycemic agents , by themselves , may differentially influence the susceptibility and clinical course of infection with B . pseudomallei . This is important in light of recent knowledge that sulphonylureas ( glyburide ) and the biguanides ( metformin ) may possess modulating capabilities on host immune response [5] , [6] . It is known that the activation of host immune defence and the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines against the pathogen is requisite [7] , [8] but opinion on the optimal cytokine milieu for facilitating an effective host response during melioidosis remains unclear [9] , [10] . Hence we aim to study whether commonly prescribed anti-diabetic medications , in particular the sulphonylureas by virtue of their ascribed immunomodulating potential , may influence outcomes in melioidosis . Consequently , we also will attempt to underline the mechanisms by which the specified drug may exert their effects on host immune response against B . pseudomallei .\nThe study was conducted at two of Singapore's largest hospitals , the National University Hospital and the Tan Tock Seng Hospital , each with more than1000-beds capacity . We identified patients diagnosed with melioidosis between January 2001 to December 2010 from the integrated hospital electronic medical record systems . A total of 116 such patients were identified , of which 15 subjects ( 12 . 9% ) did not have diabetes by history and laboratory investigation , while 27 subjects ( 23 . 3% ) were newly diagnosed diabetics upon presentation with melioidosis . The remaining 74 patients ( 63 . 8% ) had pre-existing type II diabetes and receiving medication prior to presenting with melioidosis and this was the study cohort being analysed . All patients received the recommended melioidosis treatment regimen consisting of an initial intensive therapy consisting of either ceftazidime , meropenem or imipenem intravenously for at least 2 weeks , followed by a prolonged oral eradication phase consisting of a combination of 2 oral agents from the 3 antibiotics: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( TMP-SMX ) , amoxicillin-clavulanate , doxycycline for at least 10 weeks [11] . Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was the backbone of the 2-drug eradication regimen unless there were drug tolerance issues with individual patients . The patients were followed up for at least 12 weeks . Records of pre-existing diabetic medications were obtained from clinical notes and/or verified from computerised outpatient pharmacy archives . Most of the glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) levels were measured upon admission to hospital with melioidosis . When this was not available , the last known HbA1c level ( up to 3 months prior presentation ) was traced through electronic outpatient records . The primary outcome measure was mortality . The secondary outcome measures included length of hospital stay and measures of disease severity , namely: ( i ) hypotension requiring the infusion of inotropes ( ii ) respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation ( iii ) renal impairment with need for renal replacement therapy ( iv ) septicaemia as per defined by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines [12] . The Toll like receptor ( TLR ) 4 ligand lipopolysaccharide ( LPS-EK Ultrapure , Escherichia coli serotype K-12 ) was purchased from Invivogen ( San Diego , CA ) . Metformin ( a biguanide ) , glyburide ( a sulphonylurea ) and human recombinant insulin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( Singapore ) and re-suspended in DMSO . The antibodies ERK 1&2 ( H-72 ) and p-ERK ( E-4 ) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc ( Dallas , TX ) . Overnight culture of B . pseudomallei , Bp22 , was inoculated into LB broth ( Difco Laboratories , Detroit , Michigan ) and incubated for 4 h at 37°C until an OD600 reading of 0 . 8–1 . 0 . The bacteria was pelleted at 4000 g for 10 min and washed twice with 1X phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) , prior to reconstitution in 1X PBS containing 0 . 2 µg/ml leupeptin ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) , 0 . 2 µg/ml pepstatin A ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) and 2 . 5 Kunitz units of DNase I ( Sigma-Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) . To extract bacterial proteins , the suspension was loaded into lysing Matrix B tubes ( MP Biochemicals , Solon , OH ) , and three rounds of homogenization was performed using Fastprep instrument ( MP Biochemicals , Solon , OH ) at a speed of 6 m/s for 30 s with a pause of 10–15 min in between for cooling . The bacterial lysate was centrifuged at 13000 g for 2 min , and passed through 0 . 22 µm filter unit ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA ) to remove any live bacteria . The supernatant was further purified and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal units with 10 kDa nominal molecular weight limit ( NMWL ) membrane ( Merck Millipore , Billerica , MA ) . The final purified Bp antigen were recovered in 1XPBS , quantified by BCA protein assay kit ( Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL ) and used for further stimulation experiments . Separation and stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from healthy volunteers and diabetic patients was performed as previously described [13] . Blood was drawn into sodium heparin tubes ( BD Vacutainer Franklin Lakes , NJ ) after informed consent . PBMC were isolated by density centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque ( Pharmacia Biotech , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Cells were washed , counted and adjusted to 5×106 cells/mL in culture medium ( RPMI 1640 DM supplemented with gentamicin , L-glutamine , and sodium pyruvate ) . Stimulation assays were performed in 96-well round-bottom plates using 100 µl of PBMC with the various stimuli and drugs to a total volume of 200 µl per well . PBMC were pre-incubated with metformin , glyburide , insulin or control media for 1 hour after which purified Bp antigen was added . After 24 h or 48 h of incubation in humidified atmosphere ( 5% CO2 ) at 37°C , the supernatants were collected and stored at −20°C until further assay . Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-10 , IL-1β , tumour necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) and interferon- gamma ( IFN-γ ) were measured by commercial ELISA kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) . Detection limits were 20 pg/ml ( IL-1b , TNF-α and IFN-γ ) and 10 pg/ml ( for IL-6 and IL-10 ) respectively . PBMCs from healthy volunteers were treated with glyburide , metformin , insulin and the carrier medium ( DMSO ) for 1 h , followed by stimulation with purified Bp antigen for 30 mins . Whole-cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer and protein content was determined by the Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) . 25 µg of lysates were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes . After blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk , the membranes were incubated with p-ERK ( sc-7383 ) , p-JNK ( #4668 ) or p-p38 ( #9215 ) primary antibodies . Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence detection substrate ( Pierce ) . The membranes were stripped and re-probed for total ERK ( sc-292838 ) , JNK ( #9252 ) and p38 ( #9215 ) . Western blot was also performed for MyD88 ( sc-11356 ) . Beta-actin ( sc-47778 ) was used as the loading control . Antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Cell Signaling were used . PBMC were incubated with glyburide , metformin , insulin and the carrier medium ( DMSO ) for 2 h prior to stimulation with purified Bp antigen for 30 minutes . Following stimulation , cells were washed twice with 1XPBS supplemented with 0 . 2% ( w/v ) BSA and stained with anti-CD14-V450 antibody ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) . Cells were then fixed with BD Cytofix ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and permeabilized using Perm III buffer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) for 30 minutes . The permeabilized cells were stained with mouse anti- p-ERK1/2 antibody ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , mouse anti- phospho-JNK antibody ( Cell signaling Technology , Danvers , MA ) and goat anti-IRAK-M antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) . For cells stained with unlabelled goat anti-IRAK-M antibody , secondary labeling with donkey anti-goat-FITC antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) was carried out . Stained cells were then analyzed on FACSCanto flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) and data analysis was performed using Flow Jo software ( version 7 . 6 . 5 ) ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . The expressions of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 ( IRAK-1 ) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-M ( IRAK-M ) in PBMC primed with glyburide , metformin , insulin and control medium were determined . RNA was extracted from 107 PBMC by using 1 ml TRIzol reagent ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Subsequently , 200 µl chloroform and 500 µl 2-propanol were used to separate the RNA from DNA and proteins . After washing with 75% ethanol , the dry RNA was dissolved in 50 µl of diethylpyrocarbonate ( DEPC ) water . To obtain cDNA , we reverse-transcribed 1 µg DNase-treated total RNA with oligo ( dT ) primers ( 0 . 01 µg/ml ) in a reverse transcription-PCR mixture with a total volume of 20 µl . Quantitative PCR was performed using the Bio-Rad iCycler and SYBR Green . The following primers were used ( 5′-3′ ) : GTACATCAAGACGGGAAGGC ( forward ) and AGTGTGCTCTGGGTGCTTCT ( reverse ) for IRAK-1 , GTACATCAGACAGGGGAAACTTT ( forward ) and GACATGAATCCAGGCCTCTC ( reverse ) for IRAK-M , and ATGAGTATGCCTGCCGTGTG ( forward ) and CCAAATGCGGCATCTTCAAC ( reverse ) for β2 microglobulin ( B2M ) [9] . Quantification of the PCR signals for each sample was performed by comparing the cycle threshold values , in duplicate , for the gene of interest with the cycle threshold values for the B2M as housekeeping gene . All primers were validated according to the protocol . Mean relative mRNA expression was calculated using Pfaffl method . Values are expressed as a ratio of fold increase to mRNA levels of unprimed cells . The SPSS version 20 . 0 statistical software package was used to perform the calculations . In the cohort study , the differences between patient groups were analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact probability where appropriate , for categorical variables and the t-test for continuous variables . Adjustments for the effect of HbA1c and diabetic drug usage on outcome measures were performed using binary logistic regression . For the in-vitro experiments , results were pooled from at least 3 sets of experiments and analyzed , unless otherwise specified . The cytokine data was presented as mean±standard error of the means ( SEM ) . The differences in cytokine production were tested using Mann-Whitney U test . The level of significance was set at p<0 . 05 . Ethics approval for the conduct of the above study had been attained through the Domain Specific Review Boards , National Healthcare Group , Singapore ( no . 2012/00596 and no . 2012/00949 ) . Adult study subjects had provided written informed consent to participate in the study . There were no study subjects under the age of 21 years old .\nOf the 74 subjects with pre-existing diabetes on treatment and melioidosis , 44 ( 57 . 9% ) were taking a sulphonylurea group drug either alone or in combination with other diabetic medications . The demographics and outcomes of this group of patients were studied against patients who did not receive sulphonylureas as part of their diabetic drug regimen . As described in Table 1 , the background characteristics between the 2 groups of patients including immune status and renal function were similar . Glycaemic control as judged by their most recentHbA1c sugar control was similar between both groups ( 9 . 00 versus 9 . 59 , p = 0 . 353 ) . However , patient receiving sulphonylurea-containing regimens had higher incidence of secondary end points indicating severity ( 47 . 7% versus 16 . 7% , p = 0 . 006 ) . In particular , melioidosis patients on sulphonylurea were more likely to be hypotensive requiring inotropic support ( 29 . 5% versus 3 . 3% , p = 0 . 005 ) . The other analysed criteria showed increased tendencies for mechanical ventilation and acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy . Similarly there was a trend towards increased overall mortality in patients on sulphonylurea ( 15 . 9% versus 3 . 3% , p = 0 . 080 ) . After adjustment for HbA1c , sulphonylurea usage remained a significant predictor of development of severity manifestations ( adjusted odds ratio AOR 4 . 89 , 95% confidence interval C . I . 1 . 37–17 . 5 , p = 0 . 015 ) . Mortality was not significantly linked to prior sulphonylurea exposure ( AOR 4 . 48 95% C . I . 0 . 49–41 . 4 , p = 0 . 186 ) even after HbA1c correction . Of note , concurrent insulin therapy was prescribed more in diabetic regimens not containing sulphonylureas , and the converse for α-glucosidase inhibitor . Melioidosis patients who had insulin as part of their diabetic therapy had a lower incidence of severe manifestations during infection ( 19 . 0% versus 41 . 5% , p = 0 . 104 ) . The use of metformin did not influence the clinical outcomes ( data not shown ) . To specifically elucidate the influence of the respective diabetic drugs on the immune response , PBMC from healthy volunteers were primed with metformin , glyburide and insulin and then stimulated with purified Bp antigen . Over a drug concentration range of 0 . 001 mg/mL to 0 . 01 mg/mL , glyburide clearly diminished the production of TNF-α , IL-1β and IL-10 in a dose-dependent manner as compared to Bp control ( in carrier medium ) ( Figure 1A–D ) . Conversely , insulin had a tendency to accentuate IL-1β response but this is only most evident at the dose of 0 . 01 mg/mL ( Figure 1B ) . Low dose metformin had a limited effect in enhancing TNF-α , IL-1β and IFN-γ production ( Figures 1A–C ) . To further validate the above findings in the patient cohort , PBMC from diabetic patients were stimulated with purified Bp antigen . We found that patients who had sulphonylurea in their treatment regimen for diabetes had a significantly weaker IL-1β response ( p = 0 . 04 ) as compared to patients who were on non-sulphonylurea containing regimens . The attenuative effects of sulphonylurea on the other cytokines in the patients were suggestive but not significant ( Figure 1E ) . Further to the above findings , we found that the attenuation of cytokine production by glyburide was effected upstream at the level of transcription . In the presence of glyburide , the IL-1β and TNF-α mRNA transcription was significantly reduced . In comparison , metformin and insulin induced minimal transcriptional changes ( Figure 2 ) . Because the suppressive effects induced by glyburide was generally seen with IL-1β , TNF-α and IL-10 and possibly not localized to a specific arm of the immune signaling pathway , we decided it was logical to study first , the major upstream adaptor molecule MyD88 and the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinases JNK , ERK and p38 in the canonical innate signaling pathways . However we found that the expression of MyD88 , JNK , ERK and p38 were not affected glyburide-treated cells ( Figures 3A–D ) . Recently it has been proposed that elevated expression of IL-1R-associated kinase-M ( IRAK-M ) , a regulator of the inflammatory signaling pathway , was associated with adverse outcome in septic melioidosis [9] . The role of IRAK-M in the context of diabetes treatment and melioidosis , however , is not known to date . We saw increased expression of IRAK-M mRNA in glyburide-treated cells . The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 ( IRAK-1 ) mRNA expression was not affected ( Figure 4A ) . The effects of insulin and metformin on IRAK-M and IRAK-1 were limited . This was further confirmed on flow cytometery showing increased IRAK-M expression in monocytes exposed to glyburide ( Figure 4B ) . This up-regulation of IRAK-M expression reasonably accounts for the immune suppressive effects induced by glyburide , and the association with disease severity observed with sulphonylurea use in melioidosis .\nDuring an infection the capacity of the host to mount an appropriate immune and inflammatory response against the pathogen is pivotal . In the context of recent reports that diabetic medications like glyburide and metformin may possess inherent immune modulating capabilities , at least in the in-vitro setting [5] , [6] , we felt that it was important to study this further in the clinical context of melioidosis whereby diabetics are specifically predisposed to . In this study , we found that the use of a sulphonylurea-containing diabetes treatment regimen is linked to a more severe clinical course especially hypotension during melioidosis . This finding has implications for the large number of diabetics living in melioidosis endemic regions , particularly Singapore , Thailand and Northern Australia . The low cost of sulphonylureas , its availability and its relatively wide therapeutic window contributes to the popularity of the drug . While glycaemic control between the 2 treatment groups might have been a potential factor contributing to the difference in outcomes , we have shown that HbA1c was not a significant confounder of the results . We showed that glyburide had the capacity to suppress cytokine production . These effects were seen not only in-vitro in cells primed with the drug , but also similarly demonstrated in diabetic patients who were taking sulphonylureas . The importance of this latter finding is to be highlighted in that the differences in cytokine trends could still be elicited despite the numerous of confounders like multiple co-morbidities and polypharmacy in the clinical cohort . The attenuative effect on cytokine production was exerted at the level of mRNA transcription and one of the effects of glyburide was through the enhancement of IRAK-M which assumes a regulatory or inhibitory role in proinflammatory cytokine production in the TLR/IL-1R signaling pathway though inhibition of nuclear transcription factor NF-kappaB [14] . Conversely , IRAK-1 which up-regulates NF-kappaB , is suppressed . These findings on the mechanistic action of glyburide are novel as to date; glyburide is reported to act through the NALP3 inflammasome complex [5] . The response to infection by B . pseudomallei requires the host defence to first mount a prompt and effective innate immune response [7] . Results from our studies indicate that this capacity to mount an inflammatory cytokine milieu is compromised in the background presence of sulphonylureas in the body . This hypothesis is supported by the recent finding that increased IRAK-M with consequent immunosuppresion was associated with poor outcome in melioidosis , though the specific aspect of diabetes and drugs was not looked at in that study [9] . The findings of our study is in contrast to that by another group [10] , who had reported reduced mortality , hypotension and respiratory failure with glyburide usage in melioidosis in Thailand . The group had hypothesized that the inhibition of the inflammasome and the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory process by glyburide might be beneficial in limiting sepsis-induced tissue injury and organ damage . Conversely , it is imperative that the host innate immunity be able to mount a robust inflammatory response against the pathogen during the initial phase of infection . The presence of sulphonylurea in the body compromises the immune response as we have demonstrated . Furthermore , such modulation of the IRAK complex as induced by sulphonylurea leads to susceptibility to infections as can be seen in patients with these genetic deficiencies [15] . In our smaller cohort of patients in Singapore , we were able to document diabetic drug history from our electronic records as well as the prescribed appropriate initial intensive therapy for at least 2 weeks followed by oral eradication therapy of at least 10 weeks as per recommended for melioidosis [16] . While HbA1c was not captured in the Thai cohort , we had sought to obtain the last known HbA1c of our patients and had factored glycaemic control into our analysis to show that sulphonylurea usage was an independent predictor of developing severe disease in melioidosis . In our study , the diabetic patients who were receiving insulin tended not to be prescribed concurrent sulphonylurea . This was expected as per prescribing practice in the management of diabetes . Our data suggests that patients on insulin might have a lower risk of severe septic manifestations of melioidosis . However we are cautious in not over-interpreting these results at this point as functionally , the immunomodulatory effects of insulin are not as clearly evident as compared to the suppression of cytokines induced by sulphonylurea . To validate these findings , the mechanistic effects of insulin need to be elucidated further . Diabetes mellitus remains the single most important risk factor for development of melioidosis . We find here that a sulphonylurea-containing diabetes treatment regimen suppresses the host inflammatory response and puts patients at higher risk for adverse outcomes . The implication of this finding may extend beyond melioidosis to other Gram negative septicaemia . Against the background of the popularity of sulphonylurea use in diabetes , this study highlights caution in the prescription of this class of drug especially in melioidosis-endemic regions .",
         "Melioidosis is a problem in the developing tropical regions of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia where the Gram negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause life-threatening infection . Diabetes mellitus is a recognised risk factor for melioidiosis; however little is known if commonly used anti-diabetic drugs may affect the clinical course of the disease . In this study , we found that patients who were receiving sulphonylureas for diabetic treatment had more severe septic complications requiring intensive care as well as increased risk of deaths . This may be attributable to the capacity of sulphonylureas in modulating the host immune response . We highlight caution in the prescription of this class of drug , which is popular due to its low cost and easy availability , especially in melioidosis-endemic tropical regions .",

         "The recent origin and great evolutionary potential of HIV imply that the virulence of the virus might still be changing , which could greatly affect the future of the pandemic . However , previous studies of time trends of HIV virulence have yielded conflicting results . Here we used an established methodology to assess time trends in the severity ( virulence ) of untreated HIV infections in a large Italian cohort . We characterized clinical virulence by the decline slope of the CD4 count ( n = 1423 patients ) and the viral setpoint ( n = 785 patients ) in untreated patients with sufficient data points . We used linear regression models to detect correlations between the date of diagnosis ( ranging 1984–2006 ) and the virulence markers , controlling for gender , exposure category , age , and CD4 count at entry . The decline slope of the CD4 count and the viral setpoint displayed highly significant correlation with the date of diagnosis pointing in the direction of increasing virulence . A detailed analysis of riskgroups revealed that the epidemics of intravenous drug users started with an apparently less virulent virus , but experienced the strongest trend towards steeper CD4 decline among the major exposure categories . While our study did not allow us to exclude the effect of potential time trends in host factors , our findings are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing HIV virulence . Importantly , the use of an established methodology allowed for a comparison with earlier results , which confirmed that genuine differences exist in the time trends of HIV virulence between different epidemics . We thus conclude that there is not a single global trend of HIV virulence , and results obtained in one epidemic cannot be extrapolated to others . Comparison of discordant patterns between riskgroups and epidemics hints at a converging trend , which might indicate that an optimal level of virulence might exist for the virus .\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) is a recent pathogen of humans , estimated to have jumped to the human species about 80 years ago [1] . The virus may still be adapting to humans , and this evolution may affect also its ability to cause disease . There is evidence for heritable variation in viral traits that influence the virulence of the virus ( severity of the infection ) [2]–[5] , which creates the conditions for the evolution of virulence . Multiple studies have attempted to assess time trends of HIV virulence , and have found increasing [6]–[11] , stable [12]–[17] , or decreasing [18] , [19] virulence . The discrepancies may arise either from genuine differences between the study populations or from differences in the methodology used to quantify virulence . Comparing results from different studies and assessing global trends require the use of the same methodology in different geographical areas and epidemics . Here we use a methodology developed for an earlier analysis of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study [17] , on an Italian cohort of comparable size . Our findings ( increasing virulence in Italy vs . stable virulence in Switzerland ) with the same methodology indicate that genuine differences exist between different epidemics . In addition , in the Italian cohort we found different patterns of virulence among the major exposure categories , indicating the possibility of relatively isolated sub-epidemics within the same country . Finally , we note that any measure of clinical virulence combines the effects of both host and virus factors , and must therefore be interpreted with caution . Our results are consistent with a time trend towards more virulent viruses ( either by local evolution or by the introduction and spread of more virulent viruses from other epidemics ) ; however , we could not exclude the effect of host factors .\nThe most direct measure of virulence available in untreated HIV infections is the rate of decline of the CD4 cell count in the blood . After a data selection procedure ( see Methods ) , the CD4 slope could be calculated for 1423 patients . The earliest date of confirmed infection ranged between 1984–2005; the median number of CD4 counts used in the calculation of the slope was 9 , the median baseline CD4 count was 596 cells/µL , and median age was 28 . 9 years at entry . The median CD4 slope was −50 . 4 cells/µL/year . The representation of the major exposure categories was as follows: intravenous drug-users ( IDUs ) 46 . 3% , heterosexuals ( HETs ) 36 . 6% , and men having sex with men ( MSM ) 17 . 1%; 31 . 9% of the patients were females . The CD4 slope displayed highly significant correlation with the date of confirmed infection ( Spearman's rank correlation test: rho = −0 . 16 , p<0 . 001; unadjusted effect: −1 . 7 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −2 . 3–−1 . 1 ) , in the direction of steeper CD4 slopes over the time span of the cohort . To account for potential confounding effects , we performed multivariate linear regression controlling for gender and exposure category ( reference levels were male and IDU ) , age at the date of confirmed infection and baseline CD4+ cell count; the primary variable of interest was the date of confirmed infection . The distribution of the CD4 slopes had very long tails , with 10% of the data responsible for about 70% of the range . To approach normality , we therefore discarded outliers below the 5% and above the 95% quantiles . 1279 patients were included in the main analysis; the characteristics of this group are summarized in Table 1 according to exposure category . Best model fit was achieved after merging the HET and MSM exposure categories . The effect of the date of confirmed infection was highly significant ( −2 . 0 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 7–−1 . 3; p<0 . 001 ) in the regression analysis , confirming the time trend toward steeper CD4 slopes . The effect of date on the virulence markers in the main analyses is summarized in Table 2 . The baseline CD4 count also had highly significant effect ( −0 . 048 per year; 95% CI: −0 . 058–−0 . 039; p<0 . 001 ) , indicating that the rate of loss slows down at lower CD4 counts , as has been observed before [7] , [12] , [17] . Furthermore , the HET and MSM exposure categories were associated with significantly faster CD4 decline compared with IDUs ( −27 . 6 cells/µL/year; 95% CI: −50 . 4–−4 . 9; p = 0 . 017 ) , and the interaction between the merged MSM/HET exposure category and the date of confirmed infection displayed borderline significance ( 0 . 90 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −0 . 0–1 . 8; p = 0 . 056 ) , indicating that the time trend may be less pronounced in these riskgroups . All other factors and interaction terms were dropped from the regression design due to lack of significance during model simplification ( see Methods ) . To further investigate potential differences between the riskgroups , we carried out separate regression analyses restricted to each category . The effect of date was strongest in the analysis of IDUs ( unadjusted effect: −1 . 7 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −2 . 4–−1 . 1; adjusted effect: −2 . 0 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 6–−1 . 4; p<0 . 001 ) , weaker among HETs ( unadjusted effect: −1 . 1 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −2 . 0–−0 . 3; adjusted effect: −1 . 3 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 2–−0 . 3; p = 0 . 008 ) and weakest in MSM ( unadjusted effect: −0 . 6 cells/µL/year/year , 95% CI: −1 . 7–0 . 6; adjusted effect: −1 . 01 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −2 . 16–0 . 14; p = 0 . 086 ) , where it failed to reach significance . Factors for adjustment retained after model simplification were baseline CD4 count in all three riskgroups , and also gender and age in the HET exposure category ( not shown ) . The analysis of the point estimates of the CD4 slope per patient cannot account for the misspecification of the slope of any one individual . To ensure reliable estimation , we required five CD4 measurements for the estimation of the slope; however , this requirement introduced a selection bias against fast progressors , who cannot accumulate sufficient data points before starting therapy . We therefore assessed time trends in the CD4 slope also with a mixed-effect model fitted to the original CD4 count data . The model included the same fixed effects as the general linear model , plus random intercept and slope to account for the correlation of repeated measurements within each individual . We included patients with at least three CD4 counts; this more relaxed selection criterion increased sample size to 1889 patients ( the characteristics of this group are shown in Table 1 ) . The results of the analysis were consistent with the findings from the linear regression model ( Table 2 ) . The magnitude of virus load in the blood after the resolution of primary infection ( “viral setpoint” ) has been shown to correlate with the rate of disease progression [20] and was therefore chosen as our second measure of virulence . Following data selection ( see Methods ) , we calculated the setpoint for 785 patients as the mean log virus load in each patient . The date of confirmed infection ranged between 1996–2006; the median number of RNA measurements used for the calculation of the setpoint was 7 , the median baseline CD4 count was 560 cells/µL , and the median age at entry was 34 . 1 years . The median setpoint was 4 . 21 log10 RNA copies/mL . The representation of the major exposure categories was as follows: heterosexuals 51% , MSM 29% and IDUs 20%; 30 . 6% of the patients were females . The characteristics of the study group are summarized in Table 1 according to exposure category . The setpoint displayed highly significant correlation with the date of confirmed infection ( Spearman's rank correlation test: rho = 0 . 19 , p<0 . 001; unadjusted effect: 0 . 062 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 038–0 . 085 ) , indicating an increasing trend over time . To account for potential confounding effects , we performed multivariate linear regression controlling for gender and exposure category ( reference levels were male and HET ) , age at the date of confirmed infection and baseline CD4+ cell count; the primary variable of interest was the date of confirmed infection . The effect of the date of confirmed infection was highly significant ( 0 . 043 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 019–0 . 066; p<0 . 001 ) in the regression analysis , confirming the time trend toward increasing setpoints . Higher baseline CD4 count was associated with lower virus load ( −9 . 38×10−4 log10 RNA copies/mL/cell/µL , 95% CI: −1 . 25×10−3–−6 . 30×10−4; p<0 . 001 ) except among IDUs ( IDU × baseline CD4 count: 0 . 001 log10 RNA copies/mL/cell/µL , 95% CI: 5 . 55×10−4–1 . 45×10−3; p<0 . 001 ) . Female gender was associated with lower virus load ( −0 . 24 log10 RNA copies/mL , 95% CI: −0 . 38–−0 . 11; p<0 . 001 ) and higher age correlated with lower virus load in the IDU exposure category ( IDU × age at entry: −0 . 026 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: −0 . 036–−0 . 016; p<0 . 001 ) . All other factors ( including riskgroup ) and interaction terms were dropped from the regression design due to lack of significance during model simplification . To further explore potential differences between riskgroups we carried out separate regression analyses restricted to each category . The effect of date proved strongest among MSM ( unadjusted effect: 0 . 057 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 019–0 . 096; adjusted effect: 0 . 050 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 012–0 . 088 , p = 0 . 001 ) , weaker among HET ( unadjusted effect: 0 . 047 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 017–0 . 081; adjusted effect: 0 . 037 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: 0 . 004–0 . 065 , p = 0 . 026 ) and weakest among IDU ( unadjusted effect: 0 . 042 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , 95% CI: −0 . 023–0 . 108 , p = 0 . 2; no factor had significant effect for adjustment ) , where it failed to reach significance . Factors for adjustment retained after model simplification included the baseline CD4 count for HETs and MSM , and gender in the HET exposure category ( with female gender associated with lower setpoint as in the main analysis ) . Because the distribution of setpoints displayed considerable negative skew due to a long tail of low setpoints , we repeated all setpoint analyses after discarding low setpoint values to ensure normality . The results ( including the effect of the date of confirmed infection ) were consistent with those of the analyses performed on the complete dataset . We thus observed consistent trends of increasing virulence towards both faster CD4 decline and increasing setpoints during the time span of the cohort . Because higher setpoints have been associated with faster disease progression [20] and faster CD4 decline [17] , we next asked to what extent increasing setpoints might have been responsible for the trend towards steeper CD4 slopes in our dataset . Estimates for both the CD4 slope and the viral setpoint were available for 484 patients . Consistent with earlier results , the CD4 slope was negatively correlated with the setpoint ( Spearman rank correlation test: rho = −0 . 20 , p<0 . 001; unadjusted effect: −11 . 8 cells/µL/year/log10 RNA copies/mL , 95% CI: −17 . 0–−6 . 6 ) . To dissect the contribution of increasing setpoints and other time-dependent factors to the trend towards steeper CD4 decline , we performed an extended regression analysis of CD4 slopes by adding viral setpoint as additional explanatory variable to the earlier regression design . However , because this subset had a much later median date ( due to the requirement of viral setpoint ) , we first tested the original multivariate regression design ( without setpoint ) . The effect of the date of confirmed infection remained highly significant in this more recent subset ( −4 . 4 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −6 . 2–−2 . 6; p<0 . 001 ) , and proved even stronger than in the main analysis . Further factors retained after model simplification included gender , baseline CD4 count , age and the interaction between gender and age . We then repeated the analysis including also setpoint as explanatory variable ( the effect of age and the interaction between gender and age were dropped due to lack of significance in this design ) . The effect of setpoint proved highly significant ( −14 . 4 cells/µL/year/log10 RNA copies/mL , 95% CI: −19 . 6–−9 . 3 , p<0 . 001 ) ; however , the effect of the date of confirmed infection also remained significant ( −3 . 4 cells/µL/year/year; 95% CI: −5 . 2–−1 . 7; p<0 . 001 ) , and its strength decreased by only 22 . 2% compared with the analysis not controlling for setpoint . This result suggests that the bulk of the time trend towards steeper CD4 slopes was independent of variation ( increase ) in the setpoint . We tested also the inclusion of higher order terms in the setpoint into the regression model , but these proved not to be significant . Furthermore , calculating the expected effect of the increasing setpoints on the CD4 slopes by multiplying the unadjusted date coefficient of the setpoint ( 0 . 062 log10 RNA copies/mL/year , as obtained earlier ) with the setpoint coefficient of the CD4 slope ( −14 . 4 cells/µL/year/log10 RNA copies/mL ) yields a result ( 0 . 89 cells/µL/year/year ) that is consistent with the decrease in the effect of date ( 0 . 98 cells/µL/year/year ) upon the inclusion of the setpoint in the analysis of the CD4 slopes . Using mixed-effect models , we could repeat the analyses on a considerably larger patient set due to the less stringent selection criteria ( 1120 individuals had three of more CD4 counts and an estimate for the setpoint ) , and the effect of date was consistent with the results of the linear regression analysis ( Table 2 ) . We thus conclude that the observed increase in the setpoints had a relatively small contribution to the time trend towards steeper CD4 slopes . Finally , to visualize short-term trends in the virulence markers , we plotted a moving average of both markers ( Figure 1 ) . Each point in the graphs represents the averaged value of 50 patients and is dated to their mean date of confirmed infection . The figure reveals that the trends towards increasing virulence ( steeper CD4 slope and higher setpoint ) have been stable throughout the time span of the cohort , with short-term fluctuations superimposed over the underlying long-term trend . We also calculated moving averages of both virulence markers in the major riskgroups separately ( Figure 2 ) . This fine-scale representation suggests two stages in the time evolution of CD4 slopes within the riskgroups: in the first stage , IDUs lost their initial advantage of slower CD4 decline compared with HETs and MSM . After the convergence of the three categories , the second half of the observed epidemic has been characterized by a steady coupled trend towards steeper CD4 slopes in all groups . This observation also explains why the difference in effect of date between riskgroups lost significance in the more recent set of patients for whom virus load data were also available . Trends in the viral setpoint seem to be strongly coupled between HETs and MSM with a recent deceleration of the increasing trend; the setpoint of IDUs seems to have fluctuated with no clear trend . Fine-scale resolution of time trends by moving averages thus allows a better interpretation of the results of the regression analyses . In particular , the slower CD4 decline of IDUs was restricted to the early years of the epidemic , and the estimated faster trend towards steeper slopes reflects the early convergence of this riskgroup to the others .\nWe found robust time trends both in the rate of CD4 decline and in the viral setpoint towards increasing virulence in untreated patients of the MASTER cohort . Over two decades of observations , the rate of CD4 decline in newly diagnosed infections has almost doubled , while the viral setpoint has been increasing at a rate of about one log per 16 years since RNA measurements had become available . The finding of increasing virulence is consistent with some [6]–[11] , but not all [12]–[19] earlier studies of time trends of HIV virulence in various countries . Previously , it has been unclear whether discrepancies between studies of virulence arose from differences of how virulence was quantified , or they reflected genuine differences between geographical regions and cohorts . Importantly , we used a methodology adopted from an earlier analysis [17] , which found stable levels of HIV virulence in Switzerland , over approximately the same time span as was analyzed in the current study . The use of the same methods ensures that the discrepancy reflects genuine differences in the temporal pattern of virulence between the Italian and the Swiss cohorts . This observation indicates that there is not a single “global trend” of HIV virulence , and results obtained in one local epidemic cannot be extrapolated to others . It also implies that correlating different markers of virulence will require the study of the same population with the different methods . Of particular interest would be the correlation of clinical markers , as used in this study , and replicative capacity [10] , [19] as “top” and “bottom” measures of virulence . Replicative capacity is easy to measure for individual virus isolates; however , its relationship to pathogenic effects has been shown to be quite complex [21] , [22] . We note that our “empirical” measures of virulence reflect the combined effect of both viral and non-viral ( host or environmental ) factors , and our findings are therefore not direct evidence for virus evolution . In addition to the factors incorporated in our analyses ( gender , riskgroup , age ) , the progression of HIV infections has been shown to be influenced by host genetic factors [23] , co-infections [24] , [25] and socioeconomic factors [26] . Observed time trends could , in principle , reflect changes in any of these categories , and our data did not allow us to test or exclude the effect of such host factors . Our results are consistent with time trends in the viruses circulating in the cohort ( either by evolution or by repeated introductions ) , but do not provide direct evidence or test for this hypothesis . The ultimate goal for future studies would be to identify viral factors contributing to virulence . Transmitted drug resistance has been associated with faster CD4 decline in the first year of infection [27] , the spread of resistance mutations might thus also have contributed to the observed trend in the CD4 slopes . However , the same trend existed in the pre-HAART era and most patients in our cohort were probably diagnosed after the first year of infection , which indicate the effect of other factors . We have also tested whether the criteria for starting therapy have changed over the time span of the cohort: the last CD4 count before the initiation of therapy showed a temporary peak around the beginning of the HAART era , but no trend over the studied period . A further potential confounding factor arises from our data selection procedure , which required three RNA measurements and five CD4 counts in untreated individuals to qualify for the estimation of the setpoint and the CD4 slope . These criteria selectively remove fast progressors , who may not have sufficiently long untreated disease history to accumulate the required number of measurements . However , such biased sampling should actually dampen a trend towards faster progressors and cannot have generated the observed trends as an artefact . Using mixed-effect models for the estimation of the CD4 slope , we were able to use less stringent selection conditions , and obtained consistent results . Finally , the earliest date of confirmed infection probably has a varying time lag compared to the true date of infection in the patients , which introduces variation in the disease stage at entry and uncertainty in the timing of infections . To minimize the effect of variation in the disease stage , we discarded the data points potentially associated with late-stage disease , and we also explicitly accounted for disease stage by controlling for the initial CD4 count . Uncertainties in the timing of infections may have contributed to short-term fluctuations: in particular , the temporary reversal of the CD4 slope trend around 1996 ( Figure 1 ) might have resulted from an elevated proportion of slow progressors among the newly diagnosed cases due to increased willingness for testing after the introduction of HAART . However , the effect of fluctuations in the time lag must average out in the long run , and therefore cannot generate , nor hide long-term trends . We also found differences in the time trends of virulence between riskgroups , which raises the possibility that the epidemics of the main exposure categories might have been founded by independent introductions of the virus . The strongest effect was the finding of a faster trend towards steeper CD4 slopes among IDUs , who initially had the slowest CD4 decline among the riskgroups . This suggests a plausible scenario that the IDU epidemic was by chance founded by a virus strain of reduced virulence , and occasional contact between the riskgroups later transmitted more virulent ( and apparently fitter ) viruses into this group . This hypothesis could be tested in the future by phylogenetic analysis . Alternatively , the increase in virulence might have reflected viral evolution within the IDU epidemic . It has been observed that explosive epidemics ( characteristic of early spread in IDU populations ) are associated with slow HIV evolution [28] . The IDU epidemic in our cohort followed the same pattern: more than half of all IDU infections were diagnosed in just six years between 1985–1990 . Our findings are also consistent with a scenario that selection pressure to attain optimal virulence was weak in the early years of the rapidly expanding IDU epidemic , but intensified with the slowing of the expansion , driving virulence towards the levels already attained in the slower HET and MSM epidemics . Differences in the time trends of the viral setpoint were less pronounced between the exposure categories , and we have shown that the increasing trend of the setpoint had only a minor role in the time trend towards steeper CD4 decline . Finally , we note that the overall median of the rate of CD4 decline was faster in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study ( 55 cells/µL/year ) that had stable virulence than in the Italian MASTER cohort ( 50 cells/µL/year ) that showed increasing virulence . This observation and the finding of converging levels of virulence among the riskgroups of the MASTER cohort are consistent with , but do not provide direct evidence for , the hypothesis that HIV has evolved close to the level of virulence that is optimal for its transmission [29] , and local epidemics started by a founder virus of less-than-optimal virulence might experience an increase in virulence ( whether by local evolution or repeated introductions ) . In contrast , epidemics founded by more virulent viruses might exhibit stable or even declining virulence . We conclude that trends and patterns of HIV virulence may differ between geographical regions and even between different riskgroups within the same region . The results of individual studies can therefore not be extrapolated to predict the global patterns of the evolution of HIV virulence .\nThe Italian MASTER ( Management Standardizzato di Terapia Antiretrovirale ) Cohort is a prospective longitudinal multicenter cohort comprising the general HIV patient population in referral centres throughout Italy . The analyses were restricted to patients of Italian nationality and white ethnicity for best representation of the local epidemics , and to the three major exposure categories: heterosexually infected patients ( HET ) , intravenous drug users ( IDU ) and men having sex with men ( MSM ) . Patients under age 15 were excluded from the analysis . Markers of virulence were defined as in [17] . Briefly , we calculated two markers of virulence in antiretroviral naïve patients: the linear slope of the decline of the CD4 count and the mean log virus load ( setpoint ) of each patient . Serial measurements of CD4 cell counts and plasma RNA determinations for all registered patients were obtained from the MASTER database . Only data points preceding the first initiation of antiretroviral treatment in each patient were included in the analysis . The infections were dated to the earliest date of confirmed HIV-1 infection in the patients . To eliminate confounding effects of primary and late-stage infection , we discarded data points obtained within 200 days after the earliest date of confirmed infection in each patient , and data points obtained after the first CD4 count below 100 cells/µL . The viral setpoint was calculated in patients who had at least three remaining RNA measurements spanning at least 100 days , as the mean log10 virus load per mL . The CD4 slope was estimated by linear regression in patients who had at least five remaining measurements of the CD4 count , spanning at least one year . We have verified that fitting linear decline slopes yielded smaller residual sums of squared errors than fitting exponential decline . Analyses of the CD4 slope and the setpoint were restricted to patients who had their original first CD4 count or RNA measurement obtained within one year of the earliest date of confirmed infection . We estimated the effect of the date of confirmed infection on the virulence markers by analysis of covariance ( general linear models ) . Categorical factors included gender and exposure category ( riskgroup ) ; reference levels were chosen to reflect the majority in the study groups . Continuous predictors included the earliest date of confirmed infection ( converted to Julian date ) , age at the date of confirmed infection and the baseline CD4+ cell count , defined as the first CD4+ count obtained at least 200 days after the earliest date of confirmed infection . The starting models included the interaction between gender and riskgroup , and two-way interactions between all pairs of a continuous and a categorical predictor . Significant effects were assessed by stepwise elimination of non-significant interaction terms and non-significant factors , and finally by merging non-significant levels of categorical predictors [30] . The time trend of the CD4 slopes was also investigated with mixed-effect models fitted to the CD4+ T cell counts ( relative to baseline ) from all eligible patients over time; the models accounted for the correlation of repeated measurements within each individual by random intercept and time slope . The primary explanatory variable was time since the earliest date of confirmed infection ( estimating the CD4 slope ) , and the models also included the interactions of the time with gender , riskgroup , the earliest date of confirmed infection , age at the date of confirmed infection , the baseline CD4+ cell count and ( in some analyses ) the viral setpoint , to account for the effect of these factors on the CD4 slope; and the 3-way interaction between time , date and riskgroup . Stepwise elimination of non-significant factors was performed based on likelihood ratio tests . All statistical analyses were performed with the R software package ( www . r-project . org ) . The datasets of both virulence markers were sorted into ascending order according to the date of confirmed infection of each patient . CD4 slope values below the 5% and above the 95% quantiles were excluded from the analysis . The average of 50 patients was calculated at a time , with the window of averaging moving along the lists of patients . The first point in each graph represents the average of the first 50 patients in the respective list; the second point represents the average of the patients second through 51st in the list , etc . Each average was dated on the horizontal time axis to the mean date of confirmed infection among the respective 50 patients .",
         "The AIDS epidemic claims more lives per year than any other infectious disease , even though its cause , the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) , is the youngest of all major human pathogens . The recent origin and great evolutionary potential of the virus raise the possibility that the virus might still be adapting to humans . Of primary interest is whether the virulence of the virus , i . e . its ability to cause disease , has been changing over time . Unfortunately , previous results have yielded conflicting results . We investigated time trends of virulence in the Italian HIV epidemic and found increasing virulence . The use of an established methodology allowed , for the first time , direct comparison with results obtained in other epidemics . The comparisons revealed that genuine differences exist in the trends of HIV virulence between different epidemics . Thus , there is no single time trend of HIV virulence worldwide . Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of increasing HIV virulence; however , clinical virulence combines viral and host factors , and the effect of host factors could not be excluded in our analysis .",

         "Invariant representations of stimulus features are thought to play an important role in producing stable percepts of objects . In the present study , we assess the invariance of neural representations of tactile motion direction with respect to other stimulus properties . To this end , we record the responses evoked in individual neurons in somatosensory cortex of primates , including areas 3b , 1 , and 2 , by three types of motion stimuli , namely scanned bars and dot patterns , and random dot displays , presented to the fingertips of macaque monkeys . We identify a population of neurons in area 1 that is highly sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion and whose motion signals are invariant across stimulus types and conditions . The motion signals conveyed by individual neurons in area 1 can account for the ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of motion of these stimuli , as measured in paired psychophysical experiments . We conclude that area 1 contains a robust representation of motion and discuss similarities in the neural mechanisms of visual and tactile motion processing .\nIn both vision and touch , information about form and motion is inferred from a spatio-temporal pattern of activation across a two-dimensional sensory sheet ( the retina and the skin ) . The early stages of form processing have been shown to be similar in these two modalities in that both involve decomposing the stimulus into a set of local oriented contours [1]–[3] . Furthermore , the tactile integration of local motion cues has been shown , in psychophysical experiments , to be analogous to its visual counterpart [4] and the visual and tactile perception of motion have been shown to interact ( see e . g . [5] , [6] ) . In previous studies of motion processing in primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) , a population of neurons has been identified whose responses are modulated by the direction of stimulus motion [7]–[10] . Directionally sensitive neurons have been found in three areas of what is traditionally considered S1 , namely 3b , 1 , and 2 . The question remains how representations of motion are elaborated in these three cortical areas . In the present study , we investigate the representation of motion in S1 using experimental paradigms inspired by vision research . To that end , we deliver three types of motion stimuli—bars , dot patterns , and random dot displays—to the fingertips of Rhesus macaques while recording the responses these stimuli evoke in neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 . Stimuli are delivered using a 400-probe stimulator , the tactile analogue of a visual monitor [11] . Probes are indented into the skin in spatio-temporal sequences , analogously to pixels on a monitor , to produce verisimilar percepts of shape and motion . Because the spacing between adjacent probes is shorter than that between adjacent mechanoreceptors in the skin , the inherent pixelation of the array is not felt . The bars and dot patterns are scanned across the receptive field ( RF ) in each of 16 directions ranging from 0° to 360° . The random dot displays are the tactile analogues of stimuli that have been widely used in studies of visual motion [12] , [13] . In the tactile version , a set of five hemispheric dots move across the skin surface ( see inset of Figure 1C ) ; the degree to which the dots move in a coherent direction can be varied . At one extreme ( 0% coherence ) , the direction of motion of each dot at each point in time is determined randomly . In this condition , the display cannot and does not yield any holistic percept of motion direction . At the other extreme ( 100% coherence ) , all the dots move in the same direction , and the display yields a robust percept of motion direction . At intermediate levels of coherence , the probability that individual dots move in the prescribed direction is set ( at a level determined by the motion coherence ) between 0% ( chance ) and 100% . In a paired psychophysical study , we measured the ability of human subjects to discriminate the direction of motion of these same stimuli presented to their left index fingertips . The objective of the present study was to ascertain ( 1 ) whether a population of neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 conveyed motion information that was invariant relative to the spatial properties of the stimulus ( i . e . , its two-dimensional form ) ; ( 2 ) whether the direction signal was modulated by motion coherence ( in the case of random dot displays ) as has been found for neurons in area MT; and ( 3 ) whether the motion signal conveyed by a subpopulation of neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 could account for psychophysical performance across paradigms and stimulus types .\nWe recorded the responses of 20 SA1 and 11 RA afferents , and 92 , 148 , and 37 neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 , respectively ( peripheral afferents were tested only with scanned bars; only a subset of cortical neurons was tested with all stimuli ) ( see Table 1 ) . Figure 1 shows the responses of a neuron in area 1 to ( A ) scanned bars , ( B ) dot patterns and ( C ) random dot displays varying in coherence . The neuron responded most strongly when stimuli moved medial to lateral relative to the midline with a slight proximal to distal slant ( preferred direction = 20° ) . Importantly , its preferred direction was approximately the same across stimulus types , demonstrating that this neuron conveys information about stimulus direction that is invariant with respect to spatial form . Furthermore , the neuron's responses to all the random dot displays were equal when their coherence was 0% ( cyan rasters and tuning curve in C ) but direction tuning emerged and then sharpened as the motion coherence increased . To quantify the strength of tuning , we derived a direction selectivity index ( DI ) ( see Materials and Methods ) that increased from 0 to 1 as tuning strength increased . Figure 2A shows the cumulative histogram of DI obtained from the responses of peripheral afferents and neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 to scanned bars . Responses of individual SA1 and RA afferents were not tuned for direction as evidenced by the fact that they yielded DIs near zero ( Figure 2A; also see Figures S2 and S3 ) . In contrast , tuning for direction is evident at the earliest stage of cortical processing , namely in area 3b , which comprised a large proportion of neurons that were sensitive to the direction of motion of scanned bars . Direction tuning for bars was greater in areas 1 and 2 , which contained a much larger proportion of neurons that exhibited strong direction tuning than did area 3b ( Table 1 ) . Although direction tuning in responses to dot patterns was present in areas 3b and 2 , it was stronger for neurons in area 1 ( Figure 2B , Table 1 ) ( note that , although the numerical value of DI derived from responses to dot patterns tended to be higher for neurons in area 2 than in area 3b , many of the DIs derived from area 2 responses were not statistically reliable , as shown in Table 1 ) . Finally , neurons in areas 3b and 2 exhibited only weak direction tuning in their responses to random dot displays at 100% coherence ( Figure 2C ) , whereas the responses of a large proportion of area 1 neurons were strongly tuned for direction . Area 2 neurons exhibited particularly weak direction tuning to dot patterns , suggesting that these neurons are sensitive to edges; indeed , a large proportion of area 2 neurons are orientation selective ( unpublished data ) . Despite the fact that area 2 is higher in the somatosensory pathway than area 1 , it seems that the latter comprises a more robust representation of direction of motion than does the former . Next , we examined the effect of motion coherence on direction tuning in direction-sensitive neurons . We found that the increase in tuning strength was marginal for neurons in area 3b , whereas it was substantial for neurons in area 1 ( Figure 2D ) . The tuning strength of area 2 neurons exhibited an intermediate dependence on motion coherence , and direction tuning for these neurons only emerged at high levels of coherence ( >70% ) . We then wished to ascertain ( 1 ) whether individual neurons conveyed information about direction across stimulus types and ( 2 ) whether the direction signal conveyed by those neurons remained unchanged as the stimulus type changed . To this end , we identified a population of neurons that were significantly tuned for bars , dot patterns , and random dot displays . We found that no neurons in area 3b and 8% of the neurons ( 2 of 25 neurons ) in area 2 that were tested with all three types of patterns exhibited significantly direction-tuned responses to all three stimulus types . In contrast , 30% ( 14 of 42 ) of the neurons in area 1 exhibited significant direction tuning independent of stimulus type , with a large majority having the same preferred direction for all three stimulus types ( Figure 2E and 2F ) . The direction signal conveyed by these neurons was also largely insensitive to changes in the stimulus amplitude ( i . e . , the indentation amplitude ) , or scanning speed over a wide range of behaviorally relevant amplitudes and speeds . The strength of direction tuning was not significantly modulated by stimulus amplitude ( Figure 3A; F ( 2 , 705 ) = 0 . 4 , p>0 . 6 ) . Furthermore , with few exceptions , the preferred direction was the same across stimulus amplitudes ( Figure 3B , 84% of direction selective neurons yielded preferred directions that differed by less than 45° across the two amplitudes , in contrast to afferents; see Figure S3 ) . Similarly , while strength of tuning increased slightly but significantly with scanning speed across the population ( Figure 3C; F ( 3 , 540 ) = 7 . 3 , p< . 01 ) , the strength of direction tuning of individual neurons exhibited a wide variety of relationships with scanning speed ( Figure S4 ) , as did the strength of their responses ( unpublished data ) . Importantly , the preferred direction of individual neurons was consistent across speeds ( Figure 3D ) . As shown above , a subpopulation of neurons in areas 3b , 1 , and 2 conveys significant information about direction of motion for each stimulus type ( Figure 2 ) . Can the responses of these neurons account for our ability to discriminate direction of motion ? We derived psychometric functions from clockwise-counterclockwise judgments obtained from human subjects and compared them to analogous “judgments” derived from the responses of individual neurons . Specifically , we used an ideal observer analysis to determine the extent to which stimuli moving in different directions could be discriminated on the basis of the responses these evoked in individual neurons . We found that the responses of the most direction-selective neurons in area 1 could account for psychophysical performance ( Figure 4 ) . ( We carried out this analysis using data only from neurons that were significantly direction selective for bars , dot patterns , and random dot displays . No neurons in area 3b and only 8% of neurons in area 2 met our selection criterion; see above . ) . Indeed , the direction of motion of bars , dot patterns , and random dots could be distinguished on the basis of the responses of a subpopulation of neurons in area 1 with the same accuracy as that observed in human psychophysical experiments ( Figure 4A–C , also see Figure S5 ) . Furthermore , the sensitivity of the direction signal to motion coherence mirrored that of human subjects ( Figure 4D ) . Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that area 1 comprises a population of neurons whose responses underlie our ability to perceive the direction of tactile motion . However , the neuronal and behavioral data were obtained from different species; this hypothesis could be tested in future experiments by assessing whether electrically stimulating clusters of direction selective neurons systematically affects the animal's performance in a direction discrimination task [14] or by ascertaining whether the responses of direction selective neurons are predictive of a monkey's behavior [15] , [16] . A hallmark of many visual neurons is that they are sensitive to both direction of motion and stimulus orientation . We ascertained the extent to which neurons exhibited this dual sensitivity by examining their responses to scanned and indented bars . Specifically , we gauged the strength of orientation and of direction tuning in the responses of each neuron in our sample to scanned bars . We found that these neurons spanned the spectrum of tuning properties ( Figure 5A ) . Some neurons ( 15% ) were sensitive to orientation and not direction ( Figure 5B ) ; others ( 36% ) were sensitive to direction but not orientation ( Figure 5C ) . A large proportion of neurons ( 32% ) , however , were sensitive to both; for example , the neuron shown in Figure 5D responded to a bar oriented perpendicular to the long axis of the finger regardless of whether the bar moved proximal to distal ( 90° ) or distal to proximal ( 270° ) , but produced a more robust response in the latter direction than in the former . In area MT , the relative preferred directions and orientations vary widely . However , the preferred direction is often perpendicular to the preferred orientation [17] . We tested whether this was the case for area 1 neurons by comparing the preferred orientation , measured from the responses to indented bars , to the preferred direction ( measured from the responses to scanned dot patterns ) . We found that , indeed , neurons that were sensitive to both orientation and direction exhibited a variety of relative orientation and direction preferences , with a tendency for orthogonal preferences ( Figure 5E ) . In summary , area 1 comprises a population of neurons that are strongly tuned for stimulus direction and whose tuning is invariant with respect to three major stimulus properties , namely spatial form , speed , or intensity . Furthermore , the responses of these neurons can account for the ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of moving stimuli across a range of conditions . Finally , a large population of neurons is tuned to both stimulus direction and orientation , with the preferred direction predominantly orthogonal to the preferred orientation . These neurons are specialized detectors for moving contours and thus have RF properties that are strongly analogous to those of neurons in primary visual cortex or area MT . As individual mechanoreceptive afferents are not sensitive to stimulus motion , an explicit representation of motion must emerge at higher processing stages . Computational models have been proposed to describe how the isomorphic representation of the stimulus at the somatosensory periphery is processed to yield information about direction of motion . Direction selectivity has been thought to be conferred by asymmetries in the spatial layout of in-field inhibition ( also referred to as replacing or lagging inhibition [2] , [18] , [19] ) . However , in-field inhibition is stronger in area 3b than it is in area 1 [19] , while neurons in the former exhibit weaker tuning than neurons in the latter . Rather , we propose that direction tuning first emerges in area 3b , produced in part by in-field inhibition and perhaps by mechanisms such as those observed in early visual motion processing ( see e . g . [20] ) . This direction signal is then elaborated in area 1 to yield a more invariant representation of motion direction . Models of the neural mechanisms that produce increasingly invariant motion representations with respect to other stimulus properties at successive processing stages have been developed for the visual system ( e . g . , [21] , [22] ) . The similarity in the visual and somatosensory representations of stimulus motion suggests that similar mechanisms may be involved in developing these representations in the two modalities [4] . Interestingly , complex processing of motion signals , in some ways analogous to that observed in area MT , occurs in a primary sensory area . Note , however , that area 1 is not strictly a primary somatosensory area [23] . Indeed , thalamocortical projections to area 1 are sparser , target layer III rather than layer IV , and comprise finer fibers than do those to areas 3a and 3b [24]–[27] . Furthermore , neurons in area 1 also receive strong projections from area 3b [28] . Indeed , many neurons in area 1 have larger RFs than do neurons in area 3b and are thought to each receive convergent input from multiple 3b neurons [29] . They are also less linear in the stimulus displacement profile than are their 3b counterparts [3] , [19] , which may in part account for the invariance of the representation of motion direction they carry with respect to stimulus parameters such as spatial form and speed . Area 1 also comprises a strong representation of stimulus orientation [3] and texture [30] , which suggests that it serves other functions and is not a dedicated area for motion processing . The contiguity of form , texture , and motion representations in somatosensory cortex is not surprising given that motion is a hallmark of tactile exploration . Information about motion direction may indeed be necessary to resolve the spatial relationships between stimulus features during scanning [31] .\nStimuli were generated and delivered with a device consisting of 400 independently controlled pins arrayed over a 1 cm2 area [11] . This array allows us to generate complex spatio-temporal patterns that simulate the kind of stimulation generated when a finger contacts a surface or object . Bars , scanned dot patterns , and random dot displays at 100% coherence yielded strong motion percepts as reported in pilot psychophysical experiments . Subjects were also able to clearly discern the spatial structure of the bars and the dot patterns ( see Text S1 for a discussion of tactile acuity and skin mechanics ) . To gauge the strength of direction tuning in the responses to scanned bars and dot patterns , we used vector strength: ( 1 ) where R ( θi ) is the neuron's response to a stimulus ( bar or dot pattern ) scanned in direction θi [36] . Values of DI ranged from 0 , if for example a neuron responded uniformly to all scanning directions , to 1 , when a neuron only responded to stimuli scanned in one direction . The statistical reliability of DI was tested using a standard randomization test ( α = 0 . 01 ) . The preferred direction was determined by computing the weighted circular mean: ( 2 ) We wished to assess the degree to which individual neurons also conveyed information about stimulus orientation . To that end , we computed an orientation selectivity index ( OI ) , analogous to the DI: ( 3 ) ( see above for conventions ) . Values of OI ranged from 0 , if for example a neuron responded uniformly to all orientations , to 1 , when a neuron only responded to stimuli at a single orientation . The statistical reliability of OI was tested using a standard randomization test ( α = 0 . 01 ) . The preferred orientation was then determined by computing the weighted circular mean with a moment of 2: ( 4 ) We wished to ascertain the extent to which neural responses could account for our psychophysical data using a standard ideal observer analysis . For each neuron , we randomly sampled , with replacement , from one of the five neural responses evoked by a stimulus moving in its preferred direction and one of the 10 neural responses evoked by a stimulus moving in a direction shifted by |Δφ| degrees relative to the preferred direction ( there were five presentations of each stimulus and we assumed that ±Δφ are equivalent ) . We repeated this procedure 500 times and computed the proportion of times the response was greater in the preferred direction than when the direction was shifted by Δφ for each Δφ ( ranging from 0° to 180° ) . Thus , to obtain the relative distributions of neural responses at φp and φp±22 . 5° evoked in a cell whose preferred direction was 90° , we sampled , on each of 500 iterations , one response evoked by a stimulus moving in the proximal-to-distal direction ( 90° ) and one response evoked by a stimulus moving at 67 . 5° or 112 . 5° . We then computed the proportion of times the former was larger than the latter . The resulting neurometric functions provide an estimate of how well one could discriminate direction of motion based on the responses of individual neurons . A similar analysis was performed to compute the neurometric function for random dot displays at various coherence levels: At each coherence level , responses to stimuli at the neuron's preferred direction were compared to responses to stimuli at its anti-preferred direction . For the purposes of illustration , we fit the data shown in Figure 5B–D with orientation , direction , and combined orientation/direction tuning functions , respectively . For Figure 5B , we used a von Mises function ( circular Gaussian ) with a moment of 2: ( 5 ) where R ( θ ) is the neuronal response to a bar scanned in direction θ , θp is the preferred orientation of the neuron , and α , β , and δ are free parameters representing the depth of modulation of the response , the width of tuning for orientation , and the baseline response , respectively . This function denotes orientation tuning . For Figure 5C , we used a von Mises function with a moment of 1 , which denotes direction tuning: ( 6 ) ( see above for conventions ) . Finally , for Figure 5D , we used products of von Mises functions of the form: ( 7 ) where α , β , γ , and δ are free parameters representing the depth of modulation of the response , the width of tuning for orientation , the width of tuning for direction , and the baseline response , respectively . The preferred orientations of the three neurons shown in Figure 5B–D were perpendicular to their preferred directions as reflected in the fitted function ( there is only one parameter denoting preference , namely θp ) . We also fit summed von Mises and found that the fits were equivalent but required an additional parameter ( because orientation and direction tuning needed to be weighted independently ) .",
         "When we physically interact with an object , our hands convey information about the shape of the object , its texture , its compliance , and its thermal properties . This information allows us to manipulate tools and to recognize objects based on tactile exploration alone . One of the hallmarks of tactile object recognition is that it involves movement between the skin and the object . In this study , we investigate how the direction in which objects move relative to the skin is represented in the brain . Specifically , we scan a variety of stimuli , including bars and dot patterns , across the fingers of non-human primates while recording the evoked neuronal activity . We find that a population of neurons in somatosensory cortex encodes the direction of moving stimuli regardless of the shape of the stimuli , the speed at which they are scanned across the skin , or the force with which they contact the skin . We show that these neurons can account for our ability to perceive the direction of motion of tactile stimuli .",

If you look at the Elife Document Length bar graph above that at about 110000 words in length we have a handful of very lengthy documents. This will allow us to cut back on the amount of processing and time. We will also benefit from not having content from extra large documents over weighting our tf-idf scores.

    "One of the other problems we encountered when inspecting the data is the large amount of academic in text citations. These citations cause several issues, they're so common that they occur far more frequently than content words do, which creates extra noise. They're also full of punctuation which messes with the mechanics of the sentence tokenizer we selected. This resulted in a lot of \"false\" sentences. To solve these issues we removed the citations and moved the function to do so up above the more standard cleaning function. This allows us to keep our sentence index stable throughout the process while also cutting the amount of sentences per doc by almost half."

         "In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths .\nIt is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time .\nThe strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses .\nWe used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability .\nWe used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡ ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .",
         "In the USA , more deaths happen in the winter than the summer . But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults . For example , by boosting flu vaccination rates , providing warnings about severe weather and better insulation for homes . Using technology like hands-free communication devices or home visits to help keep vulnerable elderly people connected during the winter months may also help .",

         "Whether complement dysregulation directly contributes to the pathogenesis of peripheral nervous system diseases , including sensory neuropathies , is unclear . We addressed this important question in a mouse model of ocular HSV-1 infection , where sensory nerve damage is a common clinical problem . Through genetic and pharmacologic targeting , we uncovered a central role for C3 in sensory nerve damage at the morphological and functional levels . Interestingly , CD4 T cells were central in facilitating this complement-mediated damage . This same C3/CD4 T cell axis triggered corneal sensory nerve damage in a mouse model of ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . However , this was not the case in a T-dependent allergic eye disease ( AED ) model , suggesting that this inflammatory neuroimmune pathology is specific to certain disease etiologies . Collectively , these findings uncover a central role for complement in CD4 T cell-dependent corneal nerve damage in multiple disease settings and indicate the possibility for complement-targeted therapeutics to mitigate sensory neuropathies .\nDysregulated complement activation is increasingly recognized as a significant pathological event in a variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system ( Tenner et al . , 2018 ) . These include conditions from Alzheimer’s disease and age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis ( Hong et al . , 2016; Knickelbein et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2018; Loveless et al . , 2018 ) . Complement may orchestrate peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) disorders as well . For instance , nociceptive hypersensitivities , sensory neuropathies , and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been linked to aberrant complement activation ( Rosoklija et al . , 2000; Ramaglia et al . , 2008; Jang et al . , 2010; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016; Xu et al . , 2018; Susuki et al . , 2007 ) . However , the mechanistic role of complement is not well understood in neuroinflammatory pathologies impacting the PNS . Moreover , the pathophysiological trigger of sensory fiber retraction which contributes to sensation loss and in some instances chronic pain is unclear ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Available treatments for peripheral neuropathies primarily focus on clinical symptoms without addressing the underlying pathomechanisms ( Colloca et al . , 2017 ) . Accordingly , elucidation of relevant pathomechanisms underlying sensory neuropathies may translate into efficacious mechanism-based therapeutics . The complement cascade is comprised of dozens of soluble and membrane-bound factors essential for host defense and efficient clearance of cellular debris . However , proper regulation of complement activation is necessary to balance immune responses and prevent collateral tissue damage ( Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . The complement cascade pivots upon activation of complement component 3 ( C3 ) for its downstream proinflammatory effects . The pathogenic contributions of complement in systemic disease have been reviewed extensively in recent years ( Dobó et al . , 2018; Hajishengallis et al . , 2017; McGeer et al . , 2017; Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . Nonetheless , emerging concepts centering on complement effector synthesis within inflamed tissue microenvironments have ushered in a ‘renaissance’ of novel complement-targeted drug development strategies ( Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Therefore , elucidating whether the complement cascade is a viable therapeutic target in inflammation-associated peripheral nerve impairment remains medically important . The eye has been labeled a ‘complement dysregulation hotspot’ due to complement’s contributions to many ophthalmic diseases , but complement activation is restricted in the healthy cornea ( Clark and Bishop , 2018 ) . As observed in AMD , subtle inflammatory reactions in the eye can mediate significant visual morbidity . Accordingly , ocular inflammation is tightly regulated by various anatomic , physiologic , and immunologic mechanisms in order to maintain visual acuity ( Amouzegar et al . , 2016; Streilein , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2018 ) . These homeostatic mechanisms , collectively dubbed ‘ocular immune privilege , ’ help preserve the ocular surface and enable the cornea to properly focus incoming light onto the retina . Furthermore , corneal nerves are increasingly recognized as central regulators of immune privilege at the ocular surface ( Guzmán et al . , 2018; Neelam et al . , 2018; Paunicka et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , inflammatory events that damage corneal nerves can have insidious consequences in terms of ocular surface health and transparency ( Müller et al . , 2003; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . One such pathway that can rapidly initiate inflammation following activation is the complement cascade . Corneal nerves originate predominantly from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion ( TG ) , and these peripheral nerves provide the cornea with the highest density of sensory fibers in the human body . While the cornea and peripheral nerves constitutively synthesize complement proteins ( Bora et al . , 2008; de Jonge et al . , 2004 ) , the role of the complement cascade in corneal nerve damage has not been explored . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is poised for vigorous activation in the cornea in response to noxious or inflammatory stimuli ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , C3 activation has been reported in the cornea soon after infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) , which is a common cause of corneal sensory nerve damage in patients ( Royer et al . , 2017; Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014 ) . Given the cornea’s high density of sensory nerves , it is particularly amenable for investigating the mechanistic role of complement in peripheral nerve damage . To this end , we evaluated corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function using a murine model of ocular HSV-1 infection to test the hypothesis that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage . The pathobiology underlying non-penetrating corneal nerve damage is not well understood , although inflammation is generally recognized as an important feature ( Neelam et al . , 2018; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Cruzat et al . , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017a ) . While HSV-1 is a clinically prominent cause of corneal nerve damage and sensation loss , a variety of pathogenic microbes impair the corneal nerve architecture upon ocular infection ( Cruzat et al . , 2015 ) . This observation adds to evidence that the neurotropism of HSV-1 is not directly responsible for nerve damage ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016 ) . In addition to sensation loss evoked by HSV-1 , corneal nerve alterations in other contexts such as dry eye disease are associated with a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . To further qualify the possible role of complement in corneal nerve damage independent of infection , we evaluated corneal mechanosensory function in two noninfectious T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . For this purpose , we utilized established murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Our rationale for this is that complement has been implicated in the etiology of systemic GVHD and allergic inflammation ( Gour et al . , 2018; Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Nguyen et al . , 2018; Zhang and Köhl , 2010 ) . However , a neuroinflammatory role of complement has not been described for either disease within the eye . The translational relevance of this study is underscored by in vivo confocal microscopy data from multiple clinical studies showing architectural changes in the corneal nerves of patients with herpetic keratitis , chronic ocular allergy , and ocular GVHD ( Hamrah et al . , 2010; Müller et al . , 2015; Moein et al . , 2018; Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012; Tepelus et al . , 2017; He et al . , 2017a ) . Elucidating the pathomechanisms underlying corneal nerve damage may enable development of more effective therapeutics to mitigate progression of such ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Each of the animal models utilized herein mimic clinically important , chronic ocular surface morbidities . Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) is a common cause of neurotropic keratitis and remains a leading cause of infectious corneal blindness ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014; Farooq and Shukla , 2012 ) . The incidence of ocular allergy exceeds twenty percent of the population with varying degrees of neurogenic ocular surface discomfort that can severely diminish quality of life ( Craig et al . , 2017; Patel et al . , 2017; Saban et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , GVHD is the greatest cause of non-relapse morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) used to treat life-threatening malignancies and immunologic diseases ( MacDonald et al . , 2017 ) . A majority of patients with chronic presentations of GVHD suffer from ocular surface involvement ( Shikari et al . , 2013 ) .\nAdaptive immunity has been shown to prevent recovery of corneal sensory function following ocular HSV-1 infection ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , but the initial pathophysiological triggers of denervation and sensation loss are not definitively characterized . Ocular HSV-1 infection provokes corneal denervation and sensation loss between days 5 to 8 post-infection ( p . i . ) in immunologically naive C57BL/6 mice ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . This tempo appears to be synchronized with the host transition from innate to adaptive immunity following infection . Indeed , corneal nerve fiber retraction was evident upon T cell infiltration in the cornea ( Figure 1A ) . Accordingly , we hypothesized that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage during HSV-1 infection . To address our hypothesis , corneal sensation and pathogen burden were evaluated in C57BL/6 wildtype ( WT ) and complement C3-deficient ( C3-/- ) mice following ocular HSV-1 infection . Progressive loss of corneal mechano-sensitivity was evident in WT mice by days 5 to 8 p . i . , but corneal sensation was conserved in the C3-/- cohort ( Figure 1B ) . The same trend revealing preservation of corneal sensation in C3-/- animals was also observed with an increased HSV-1 challenge inoculum ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Viral titers were measured at time points before and after the onset of corneal sensation loss to determine whether the divergence in sensation stemmed from a differential susceptibility to infection . On day 3 p . i . , the HSV-1 burden was similar in the tear film , corneas , and TG of WT and C3-/- animals ( Figure 1C–D ) . By day 7 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were elevated in the tear film and TG of C3-/- mice relative to WT ( Figure 1C , E ) . Corneal buttons from WT mice exhibited extensive denervation with CD3+ T cell infiltration at day 8 p . i . ( Figure 1F ) . However , T cell infiltration was observed without widespread denervation in C3-/- corneas ( Figure 1F ) . The number of cornea-infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were similar among WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1G ) . Together , these data indicate that corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis involves a C3-dependent inflammatory process independent of viral burden . Although T cells successfully extravasate into the corneas of WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1F , G ) , C3-deficiency can have broad impacts on T cell priming , clonal expansion , and recruitment ( Clarke and Tenner , 2014; West et al . , 2018 ) . To investigate this possibility , corneas from HSV-1-infected WT and C3-/- mice were evaluated for chemokines associated with T cell recruitment , and the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) were harvested to evaluate T cell responses . Chemokines associated with T cell recruitment were elevated in corneas from both WT and C3-/- mice at day 5 p . i . —a time consistent with onset of sensation loss ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion was comparable within the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) from WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 2B ) . Similarly , T cells harvested from WT and C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . responded equally to in vitro stimulation in terms of IFNγ production ( Figure 2C ) . Collectively , these data show that C3-/- T cells exhibit normal expansion and recruitment to the cornea during ocular HSV-1 infection . In support of our hypothesis that C3 and T cells jointly coordinate corneal sensation loss , frank corneal sensation loss was not observed following ocular HSV-1 infection in C3-sufficient , alpha-beta T cell receptor-deficient mice ( TCRα-/- ) which congenitally lack classical CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Figure 2D ) . To investigate potential functional defects of C3-/- T cells in an in vivo context , CD3+ T cells were harvested from HSV-infected WT or C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . and adoptively transferred into TCRα-/- mice . Six days following cell transfer , TCRα-/- recipients were infected with HSV-1 and corneal sensation monitored longitudinally . Adoptive transfer of CD3+ T cells from either WT or C3-/- donors evoked progressive corneal sensation loss in TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2D ) . These findings further corroborate that C3-/- T cells remain functional in vivo . Analysis of corneal sensation was not feasible beyond 8 days p . i . , as the TCRα-/- mice succumbed to herpetic encephalitis . However , engraftment of donor cells was confirmed by analysis of T cells in the eye-draining MLN of recipient mice by flow cytometry at day 8 p . i . The baseline lymphocyte counts in MLN from TCRα-/- controls likely reflect expansion of non-classical T cell populations ( Viney et al . , 1994 ) . An increase in total cell number was observed for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells upon adoptive transfer of purified CD3+ T cells into TCRα-/- recipient mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Consistent with this observation , our data show that transfer of CD3+ T cells from HSV-infected mice have no appreciable impact on HSV-1 titers in the TG of TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Notably , bulk transfer of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells has been shown to reduce viral burden in the peripheral nervous system of C57BL/6 mice during acute HSV-1 infection ( Conrady et al . , 2009; Royer et al . , 2016 ) . Our collective findings reveal that C3 and T cells are individually necessary and interdependent in the pathogenesis of HSV-1-associated corneal sensation loss . Whether by direct or indirect mechanisms , these data support a paradigm in which C3 activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage in herpetic keratitis . Our data show that T cells contribute to corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection , yet whether this pathology is dependent upon CD4+ or CD8+ T cells remained unclear . To better discern the contributions of each subset , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested from infected WT mice , transferred into separate groups of TCRα-/- mice , and recipient mice subsequently infected with HSV-1 . Corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection was only observed upon reconstitution with CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3A ) . Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by flow cytometry , although a statistically significant increase in cell number within the eye-draining MLN was only observed upon transfer of CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The requirement for antigen specificity was subsequently evaluated during acute HSV-1 infection by monitoring corneal sensation in WT and OT-II transgenic mice that generate ovalbumin ( OVA ) -specific CD4 T cells . Transgenic OT-II mice did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following infection despite evidence of bystander CD4+ T cell activation and recruitment into the cornea ( Figure 3B–D ) . Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from HSV-infected WT and OT-II mice into TCRα-/- recipients corroborated these findings ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Abrasion of the corneal epithelium , which is required to mediate infection in this model , induces local chemokine expression capable of recruiting T cells to the cornea even in the absence of viral infection ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Nonetheless , active corneal HSV-1 infection was necessary to provoke corneal sensation loss , as TCRα-/- mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells harvested from HSV-infected WT mice did not elicit auto/allo-antigen-associated sensation loss within two weeks of corneal scratch injury ( i . e . mock infection ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Collectively , our data show that complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are simultaneously necessary to drive corneal sensation loss during HSV-1 infection . These results strongly portend that a coordinated inflammatory axis exists involving C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells , and that it is responsible for sensory neuropathy in herpetic keratitis . Complement-mediated tissue pathology can arise from complement activators synthesized by the liver ( systemic complement ) or in tissue microenvironments ( local complement ) . While local complement activation and regulation have been reported in the cornea in health and disease ( Bora et al . , 1993; Clark and Bishop , 2018; Mondino and Brady , 1981; Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) , the expression profile and cellular sources of various complement components have not been investigated in the context of ocular HSV-1 infection . To this end , a modest array of complement component transcripts was evaluated by semiquantitative real-time PCR on corneal buttons from healthy and HSV-infected mice at day 2 and 7 p . i . Upregulation of complement effectors and anaphylatoxin receptors were noted including C3 , C5 , C3ar1 , and C5ar1 ( Figure 4A , B ) . Constitutive expression of complement receptor 2 ( CD21 ) has been reported in the corneal epithelium ( Levine et al . , 1990 ) , but variances in its expression during HSV-1 infection were not statistically significant across the time points evaluated ( Figure 4B ) . Likewise , no differences in the local expression of various complement regulators were observed in HSV-infected corneas aside from the C1-inhibitor SerpinG1 ( Table 1 , Figure 4C ) . Collectively , this expression profile favors local complement activation , as effectors are upregulated without proportional enhancement of pathway regulatory components . As C3 is the central component of the complement activation pathway , the cellular sources of complement C3 were evaluated in corneas infected with HSV-1 . Monocytes and tissue macrophages are known sources of C3 ( Einstein et al . , 1977; Lubbers et al . , 2017; Morgan and Gasque , 1997; Verschoor et al . , 2001 ) , thus CSF1R+ cells from the peripheral blood of transgenic CSF1R-GFP mice ( MAFIA ) were utilized as the relative standard for C3 transcript expression . Expression of C3 was noted in CD45+ leukocytes isolated from infected corneas , yet detection of C3 expression was lost when CSF1R+ cells were removed from the total CD45+ pool . In addition , isolated EpCAM+ corneal epithelial cells expressed C3 at levels comparable to blood monocytes . However , the C3 expression level was greater in whole-cornea preparations than among individual cell fractions ( Figure 4D ) . Taken together , our data show that both tissue-resident non-hematopoietic cells and resident/infiltrating CSF1R+ leukocytes contribute to local C3 expression in the cornea during acute HSV-1 infection . Ocular HSV-1 infection amplifies local complement gene expression , yet whether local control of complement activation can be harnessed to prevent corneal nerve damage has not been explored . From a clinical perspective , modulating complement activation at the ocular surface may be a viable therapeutic option . As a proof of concept , daily ocular cobra venom factor ( CVF ) treatment was explored as a putative method to deplete C3 and preserve corneal sensation during acute HSV-1 infection . Vehicle ( PBS ) -treated mice exhibited corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection , but CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation ( Figure 5A ) . Protein levels of C3 remained near baseline in the cornea following CVF treatment during HSV-1 infection , yet vehicle-treated animals exhibited a 300–600% increase in C3 protein levels in the cornea at days 3 and 7 p . i . ( Figure 5B ) . Ocular CVF treatment did not significantly impact systemic serum C3 concentrations throughout the study ( Figure 5C ) . Ocular CVF treatment limited corneal edema during HSV-1 infection relative to the vehicle control ( Figure 5D ) . Consistent with this observation , CVF-treated animals had less leukocytic infiltrate ( CD45+ ) into the cornea at day 3 p . i . and , specifically , fewer infiltrating CSF1R+ cells ( Figure 5E , F ) . By day 7 p . i . , no difference in total CD45+ or CSF1R+ cells were observed in the cornea , yet there was a reduction in the total number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells ( Figure 5G ) . Despite the difference in CSF1R+ cell infiltration into the corneas at day 3 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were similar in the corneas and TG comparing vehicle- and CVF-treated animals ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . By day 7 p . i . CVF-treated animals had less virus in the corneas and TG than vehicle controls ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting that CVF may have unexpected antiviral effects . However , CVF treatment did not have any discernable impact on T cell expansion in the eye-draining MLN or the total number of circulating CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells in HSV-1 infected animals ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Collectively , these findings imply that complement-targeted therapeutics could be tailored for ophthalmic use to limit tissue inflammation and preserve corneal sensation . While complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells appear to coordinate corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis , it remained to be determined whether this phenomenon was specific to HSV-1 infection . To this end , corneal sensation was measured independent of infection in two T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) were employed to further delineate the hypothesized role of T cells in coordinating corneal nerve damage ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . First , AED was induced using an established systemic ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitization and ocular challenge model ( Figure 6A ) mimicking aspects of chronic keratoconjunctivitis ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Clinical signs of ocular allergy developed as anticipated in OVA-challenged mice ( Figure 6B ) , yet corneal sensation loss was not observed ( Figure 6C ) . Consistent with development of AED , corneas from OVA-challenged mice exhibited CD3+ T cell infiltration by challenge day 7 ( Figure 6D ) . However , frank corneal nerve loss was not observed in AED ( Figure 6D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the preservation of corneal nerve density during AED ( Figure 6E ) , although CD3+ T cell numbers were elevated in sensitized animals relative to healthy controls ( Figure 6F ) . Flow cytometry was used to verify that the cornea-infiltrating T cells were predominately CD4+ in the AED model ( Figure 6G ) . Although clinical data show that corneal nerve remodeling can occur in patients with chronic ocular allergy ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011 ) , allergy symptoms were not accompanied by frank loss of corneal mechano-sensation in the AED animal model . Corneal sensation was also evaluated in a T cell-dependent allogeneic model of chronic GVHD with systemic and ocular manifestations following hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . This minor histocompatibility antigen mismatch model was established by transferring HSC-rich bone marrow ( BM ) and purified T cells from C57BL/6 ( H2b ) donors into lethally irradiated sex-matched C3 . SW-H2b recipients . Recipient controls that receive BM without T cells recover and do not develop GVHD ( Figure 7A ) . Onset of GVHD was established by transfer of BM with CD4+ T cells only , CD8+ T cells only , or both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . Progressive corneal sensation loss was observed following transfer of CD4+ T cells with and without addition of CD8+ T cells . Addition of CD8+ T cells alone evoked a transient corneal sensation deficit that recovered by day 26 post-transplant . However , corneal sensation loss was not observed in the BM only control group ( Figure 7B ) . External signs of ocular disease ( see Table 2 ) were also apparent in groups receiving CD4+ T cells by the study endpoint ( Figure 7C ) . The presence of tissue-infiltrating CD3+ T cells in corneas from animals with GVHD was verified by confocal microscopy at the study endpoint . Consistent with sensation loss , corneal nerve integrity was markedly reduced in groups receiving CD4+ T cells ( Figure 7D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the CD4-dependent decrease in corneal nerve density ( Figure 7E ) and concomitant increase in total CD3+ cells ( Figure 7F ) . Taken together , our data show for the first time that corneal sensation loss occurs early in ocular GVHD and that this pathology is instigated in part by allogeneic CD4+ T cells . The pharmacologic impact of local CVF treatment on ocular GVHD progression was consequently explored in order to identify whether the CD4+ T cell-associated corneal sensation loss observed in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GVHD shared a common C3-codependent pathomechanism . For these experiments , GVHD was established in C3 . SW-H2b recipients by transfer of C57BL/6-derived BM and CD3+ T cells . Recipients from the BM only control and GVHD cohorts received ophthalmic treatment with either PBS or CVF ( Figure 8A ) . Systemic disease progressed equally in both GVHD cohorts regardless of treatment ( Figure 8B ) . Although CVF administration was limited to the eye , systemic serum C3 concentrations were lower in the GVHD cohort treated with CVF compared to the PBS-treated GVHD groups at the study endpoint . Nonetheless , the inverted CD4:CD8 T cell ratio ( Herretes et al . , 2015 ) in the spleens and eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes of both groups of GVHD mice confirmed the presence of systemic disease ( Figure 8D ) . Despite development of systemic disease , local CVF treatment preserved corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD ( Figure 8E , F ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks from the study endpoint corroborated the preservation of corneal nerve density in CVF-treated mice from the GVHD cohort ( Figure 8G ) , although CVF did not reduce the number of total CD3+ cells during GVHD relative to PBS ( Figure 8H ) . In addition , CVF treatment also limited GVHD-associated periocular disease in female but not in male mice ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . In summary , these preclinical models establish that CD4+ T cells and complement C3 coordinate corneal sensory nerve damage in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GHVD . Moreover , our data provide a proof of principle that complement-targeted therapeutics may limit the severity of immune-mediated sensory nerve damage at the ocular surface .\nMechanistic advances in our understanding of the complement cascade’s physiologic regulation and pathologic contributions in disease have predictably spawned substantial investments in complement-targeted drug development over the past decade ( Harris et al . , 2018; Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . The ocular surface is a unique milieu in which pharmacologic modulation of the complement pathway may limit the severity of inflammatory disease and improve clinical outcomes . This study provides proof of concept that such interventions may have important clinical impacts on ocular surface disease , and specifically neuropathic sensory disorders affecting the cornea . Complement-targeted drug development for ophthalmic use has almost exclusively focused on AMD with some interest in neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) , Stargardt disease , and autoimmune uveitis ( Harris et al . , 2018; Pittock et al . , 2013 ) . By July 2019 , there were no complement-specific therapeutics indicated for ocular surface use registered on www . clinicaltrials . gov ( search strings: ‘complement’ / ‘C3’ / ‘C5’ / ‘eculizumab’ AND ‘cornea’ , ‘conjunctiva’ , ‘dry eye’ , ‘keratitis’ , OR ‘ocular surface’ ) . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of several ocular surface diseases ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . The current investigation provides an important advancement in this arena by demonstrating that dysregulated complement activation can specifically contribute to sensory nerve damage in the cornea . While corneal nerves are increasingly implicated in maintenance of corneal immune privilege ( Paunicka et al . , 2015; Neelam et al . , 2018; Guzmán et al . , 2018 ) , this study is the first to identify that C3 is involved in the pathobiology of corneal sensory nerve damage . However , the individual fates of damaged corneal nerves were not explored herein . Lessons from peripheral nerve injury in other settings indicate that some damaged nerves undergo apoptosis , yet effectively promoting functional regeneration of surviving neurons remains a major clinical hurtle ( Doron-Mandel et al . , 2015; Menorca et al . , 2013; Scheib and Höke , 2013; Shacham-Silverberg et al . , 2018 ) . Likewise , promoting functional regeneration of damaged corneal nerves is important for restoration of immune privilege and ocular surface health . Our approach evaluated sensory nerve damage in murine models of T cell-dependent ocular surface disease including HSV-1 keratitis , OVA-induced AED , and ocular GHVD . The lack of a sensory phenotype in the AED model was unanticipated in light of evidence that patients with severe allergy exhibit changes in corneal nerve morphology ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012 ) . This contrasting model underscores the context-dependency of sensation loss during corneal inflammation . While we focused on C3 in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD due to the direct link to overt corneal sensation loss , complement may still have an important role in mediating neurogenic hypersensitivities in AED . In addition to loss of mechano-sensory function , corneal nerve pathologies can involve a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . Inflammatory mediators facilitate neuropathic hypersensitivities , but the therapeutic potential of complement inhibition is often overlooked ( Baral et al . , 2019; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016 ) . Moreover , the cornea produces many neurotrophic factors that influence sensory innervation in health and disease ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2017; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . Given the involvement of C3 activation in sensory nerve damage , future investigation into crosstalk between complement and other neurotropic factors in the cornea is warranted . Furthermore , AED is driven primarily by a combined Th2/Th17 CD4 T cell response that differs from the Th1 bias observed in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Saban et al . , 2013; Tang and Hendricks , 1996 ) . This suggests that Th1 cytokines such as IFNγ , IL-2 , and lymphotoxin-alpha may be important in coordinating corneal sensation loss . Nonetheless , the unique inflammatory milieus and differential polarizations of cornea-infiltrating T cells across these disease models may also influence the downstream effects of complement activation in the tissue microenvironment ( Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Future studies are needed to broaden the scope of these observations to other peripheral nerve diseases . For example , complement-mediated microvascular damage in diabetes correlates with neuropathy ( Rasmussen et al . , 2018; Rosoklija et al . , 2000 ) . While diabetic peripheral neuropathy can lead to neurotropic corneal ulcerations ( Gao et al . , 2016b ) , the role of complement in diabetic corneal disease is currently unknown . Complement enhances clearance of infected cells and nascent virions during HSV-1 infection ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987 ) . Importantly , HSV-1 can also evade C3 activation through endogenous expression of glycoprotein C ( gC ) . By limiting C3b deposition on infected cells and nascent virions , gC can inhibit subsequent C5 binding and membrane attack complex ( MAC ) formation ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987; Tegla et al . , 2011 ) . This could explain why herpetic keratitis is less severe in rabbits infected with a gC-deficient strain of HSV-1 during acute infection ( Drolet et al . , 2004 ) . However , this gC-mediated viral evasion strategy may also be cell type-dependent . Cell culture modeling indicates that neuronal cells maintain host-encoded complement regulator expression more efficiently and are more resistant to MAC deposition than epithelial cells upon HSV-1 infection ( Rautemaa et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , complement-mediated sensory nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis may reflect a maladaptive outcome of host-defense . This is consistent with our data showing that immunologically naive C3-/- mice maintain corneal sensation and innervation , yet they exhibit concomitant enhancement of viral shedding in the tear film and increased viral burden in the TG by day 7 p . i . The absence of a concordant difference in HSV-1 titers in corneas from WT and C3-/- mice is likely explained by the potent antiviral effects of type-1 interferon ( Conrady et al . , 2011; Royer and Carr , 2016 ) . This suggests that the maintenance of corneal innervation in C3-/- mice enables enhanced shedding of nascent virions produced within the TG . Moreover , there is no difference in the amount of latent HSV-1 in the TG of naive WT and C3-/- mice 30 days after ocular HSV-1 challenge ( Royer et al . , 2019 ) . Taken together , this evidence indicates that although C3 is involved in progression of keratitis and sensory nerve fiber retraction during acute infection , it likely does not contribute to complete elimination of infected nerves . The studies reported herein involve immunologically naive mice , but the impacts of preexisting humoral immune responses on complement pathway activation and regulation in the cornea during HSV-1 infection remain incompletely understood . This point is of considerable importance clinically , as herpes-associated neurotropic keratitis typically develops as a result of recurrent corneal infections in patients ( Hamrah et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , we have recently reported that C3 is essential for optimal antibody-dependent viral clearance following ocular HSV-1 challenge in mice ( Royer et al . , 2019; Royer et al . , 2017 ) . While vaccinated animals did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following ocular HSV-1 infection in those studies , deposition of the terminal C3 cleavage product C3d was present in the corneal epithelium ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Host gene expression data herein corroborates that HSV-1 infection creates an imbalance in the local complement effector to regulator expression ratios that contribute to aberrant complement pathway activation in the cornea . This imbalance in ‘complement proteostasis’ may favor deposition of complement fragments and sublytic MAC on corneal sensory nerve fibers ( Tegla et al . , 2011; Triantafilou et al . , 2013 ) . Notwithstanding , the nerve-intrinsic molecular mechanisms responsible for trigeminal sensory fiber retraction , neuronal death , or axonal regeneration in the cornea are largely unknown ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Future work is needed to identify the respective complement activation pathways involved in pathologic and protective immune responses to HSV-1 in the cornea . Identification of the complement pathway’s role in initiating corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection is an important advancement in the mechanistic understanding of this disease process , as it introduces an array of potential drug targets for local therapy . Previous observations note that complement activation in antigen-induced keratitis may be mediated by cellular immune mechanisms ( Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) . The identification of CSF1R+ macrophages/monocytes as a local source of C3 during infection ( Figure 4D ) is also critical , as these cells are recruited to the cornea in the early stages of HSV-1 infection and are associated with corneal nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Conrady et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , CD4 T cells coordinate this pathology . Our data corroborate findings from the Hendricks’ lab showing that CD4 T cells are associated with corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 keratitis ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , yet our adoptive transfer experiments establish that this process is not dependent upon endogenous C3 production by cornea-infiltrating donor T cells ( Figure 2D ) . Notably , the tempo of HSV-associated sensation loss was consistent among models once initiated ( Figure 1B , Figure 2D , Figure 3A ) . However , the initial onset was delayed by one day in the adoptive transfer model . This likely reflects the relative lymphopenic status of T cell-reconstituted TCRα-/- mice compared to WT mice ( compare Figure 2B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 infection and ocular GVHD shared a common mechanism dependent upon CD4+ T cells and complement C3 . The role of intracellular C3 in regulating human Th1 responses has received much attention in recent years ( Elvington et al . , 2017; Hansen et al . , 2019; Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Such studies involve CD3 and CD46 stimulation to activate human CD4 T cells in vitro . However , mice do not express CD46 . Instead , anaphylatoxin receptor signaling has been shown to modulate Th1 cytokine production in murine T cells ( Strainic et al . , 2008 ) . Our ex vivo re-stimulation data clearly show that there is no defect in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice following HSV-1 infection . Others have shown similar data based on T cell proliferation in response to re-stimulation with HSV-1 antigen ( Da Costa et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , a reduction in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice was reported following in vitro expansion under Th1 polarizing conditions ( Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Nonetheless , it is possible that anaphylatoxin receptor signaling from locally produced C3a ( and potentially C5a generated downstream ) modulates T cell effector function upon extravasation into the inflamed cornea . The precise relationships between T cells and C3 in our mouse models of corneal neuropathic disease remain to be identified . Our working hypothesis involves an indirect mechanism whereby sublytic MAC deposition from local complement activation damages sensory nerves , which are then cleared by T cell-activated phagocytes or other cytolytic cells . These could include tissue-resident and infiltrating leukocytes ( macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells , and NK cells ) as well as nerve-associated corneal epithelial cells ( Buela and Hendricks , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Gao et al . , 2016a; Koyama and Hill , 2016; Liu et al . , 2017; Royer et al . , 2018; Seyed-Razavi et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Emerging evidence indicates that the plasma membranes of corneal nerves and epithelial cells fuse thereby enabling cytosolic exchange ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . In light of this , it is plausible that complement-mediated damage to corneal epithelial cells has a direct impact on sensory nerves . Although corneal nerve damage is an established pathology in animal models of HSV-1 infection ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015; He et al . , 2017b; Yun et al . , 2014 ) , this is the first report documenting loss of corneal mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD . Notably , patients rarely exhibit neurological manifestations of GVHD affecting other tissues/organs ( Grauer et al . , 2010 ) . Corneal sensation loss may provide a clinical benchmark for initiation of targeted therapies to curb progression of ocular GVHD in patients . Data from our animal model of GVHD suggest that corneal sensation loss is an early warning sign of progressive ocular and systemic GVHD . Corneal sensation measurements are warranted in patients following HSCT to substantiate this finding among those who develop chronic GVHD . Published imaging studies confirm that corneal nerve remodeling occurs in patients with ocular GVHD ( He et al . , 2017a; Tepelus et al . , 2017 ) ; therefore , clinical studies to delineate the kinetics of disease onset are needed . Complement C3 is a known driver of systemic GVHD ( Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Seignez et al . , 2017 ) , and our data show that aberrant complement pathway activation also contributes to the pathogenesis of ocular GVHD including corneal sensation loss . Furthermore , localized CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation in both sexes during ocular GVHD , but treatment only abrogated other facets of ocular surface disease in female mice . This dimorphic outcome may reflect insufficient maintenance of C3 depletion in the ocular surface microenvironment , as animals were only treated twice weekly . Furthermore , complement activity is reportedly limited by terminal pathway components in female mice compared to males ( Kotimaa et al . , 2016 ) . Collectively , our data suggest that sensory nerve involvement may be a unique facet and treatment target in ocular GVHD . While the complement pathway has many components , C3 is the heart of the pathway and its activation products mediate virtually all downstream pathway functions . Accordingly , we used CVF to target complement activation in models of HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD as a proof of concept for local delivery of complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface disease . In contrast to the neurotoxic effects of complete cobra venom , purified CVF is a ‘nontoxic’ derivative . CVF forms a biochemically stable convertase to rapidly hydrolyze mammalian C3 and C5 . This ultimately results in complement inactivation via effector consumption ( Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . The only recorded side effect of purified CVF administration in rodents is transitory anaphylatoxin-mediated pulmonary inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress ( Proctor et al . , 2006; Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . In our hands , respiratory distress was observed in some mice following the initial sub-conjunctival CVF injection irrespective of group assignment ( animals were euthanized ) . However , topical CVF administration did not provoke respiratory or corneal abnormalities in any animals . Previous findings also show that topical CVF administration has no obvious effects on corneal health or transparency ( Zaidi et al . , 2010 ) . Experimental CVF administration was once thought to directly stimulate T cells , but such effects were later attributed to mitogen contamination ( Rumjanek et al . , 1978; Cauvi et al . , 2012 ) . Because our disease models were T cell-dependent , we utilized highly-purified CVF from a commercial source for our studies . Moreover , we found no evidence to suggest that CVF impacted T cell responses outside of the eye . Local CVF treatment reduced corneal T cell infiltration following HSV-1 infection ( Figure 5G ) . However , this is likely due to reduced inflammation overall in C3-depleted corneas ( Figure 5D ) . Likewise , ocular CVF treatment in the GVHD model did not impact on the total numbers of T cells in the corneas at the experiment endpoint . However , we have not excluded the possibility that CVF treatment may delay the tempo of T cell influx . Nonetheless , CVF administration preserved corneal sensation in both disease models . By addressing the ‘heart’ of the complement pathway ( C3 ) , this study opens the door to future investigation to further elucidate the relevant pathomechanisms and corresponding therapeutic targets . The relevant complement activation pathways ( classical , alternative , lectin , terminal ) , cellular targets , and impacts of anaphylatoxin receptor signaling are topics of future investigation . Complement activation is a double-edged sword in the cornea , as activation can be either protective or harmful . Low-level complement turnover is observed in healthy corneas/tears , and complement may even contribute to the relative ‘paucibacterial’ state of the ocular surface microbiome ( Doan et al . , 2016; McDermott , 2013; Willcox et al . , 1997 ) . The mechanisms regulating each complement-mediated effect remain incompletely understood . Elucidation of how complement activation is triggered , the relevant molecular mechanisms of its downstream signaling , and contributions to pathology will promote an important advancement in drug development for ocular surface disease . Animal models are necessary for mechanistic studies when it comes to understanding complement pathway regulation , especially in dynamic tissue microenvironments; however , differences in complement regulation exist between mouse and man that will also have to be resolved to further assess the translational potential ( Jacobson and Weis , 2008 ) . This certainly applies to putative complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface treatment . Even among individual patients , small nucleotide polymorphisms evoke changes in complement activity that have major impacts on disease risks . Such genetic linkages , dubbed ‘complotype , ’ are important in differential susceptibility to AMD ( Harris et al . , 2012; Paun et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , complotype differences may help explain differential susceptibility patterns in a variety of ocular surface diseases . Our data herein have demonstrated successful prophylactic intervention in repressing complement-mediated sensory nerve pathology in two well characterized experimental T cell-dependent corneal disease models . Other avenues of future investigation are also needed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic intervention on established ocular surface diseases . Successful implementation of complement-targeted therapeutics for topical ophthalmic use may provide the benefit of controlling insidious ocular surface diseases without the risks associated with systemic therapies .\nMouse strains were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . These include: C57BL/6 , C3-/- ( stock #029661 ) , TCRα-/- ( stock # 002116 ) , OT-II ( stock #004194 ) , MAFIA/CSF1R-GFP ( stock #005070 ) , C3 . SW-H2b ( stock #000438 ) , and B6-GFP ( stock #003291 ) . Colonies were maintained in select-pathogen-free vivaria at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center or Duke University Medical Center . Research was performed in accordance with protocols approved by respective institutional animal care and use committees . For all procedures relating to ocular HSV-1 infection , C57BL/6-background mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and euthanized by cardiac perfusion ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . For infection , corneas were scratched to expose the epithelium and 1000 plaque forming units ( PFU ) of HSV-1 McKrae was applied to each eye . Viral stocks were propagated and infectious titers quantified by standard plaque assay on Vero cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) as previously reported ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . For adoptive transfers , T cells were purified from splenocyte preparations using a BioRad S3e cell sorter ( Hercules , CA ) . Corneal complement C3 depletion was achieved by subconjunctival injection of CVF ( Cat . # 233552 , Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA ) followed by topical maintenance dosing as described in respective figure legends . Allergic eye disease was initiated in B6 mice as previously described ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015; Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , hypersensitivity was elicited via intraperitoneal immunization with 10 μg ovalbumin ( OVA ) adjuvanted with 1 mg Alum and 300 ng pertussis toxin ( all from Sigma-Aldrich Corp . , St . Louis , MO ) . Ocular allergy was subsequently induced via daily eyedrop challenge containing 250 μg OVA ( Figure 6A ) . Clinical signs of AED were scored daily using established criteria ( Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation for tissue collection . Induction of GVHD was based on an established T-dependent , MHC-matched unrelated donor model ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , C3-SW . H2b mice were lethally irradiated ( 10 . 5 Gy , Cs-137 ) and reconstituted with 5 × 106 T cell-depleted bone marrow ( TCD-BM ) cells from allogeneic C57BL/6 ( H2b ) mice . T cell depletion was achieved using BD anti-mouse CD90 . 2 IMag particles ( Cat . # 551518 , San Jose , CA ) . Control groups received TCD-BM only , but GVHD onset required reconstitution with TCD-BM and T cells . T cells were isolated from B6 splenocytes using immunomagnetic microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , San Diego , CA ) targeting CD4 ( Cat . #130-049-201 ) , CD8 ( Cat . #130-116-478 ) , or CD90 . 2 ( Cat . #130-049-101 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell purity was evaluated by flow cytometry ( ~80% ) and adjusted such that 1 . 3 × 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or 2 . 3 × 106 CD3+ T cells were injected into each recipient with TCD-BM . Irradiated animals received water containing gentamicin ( 6 . 6 μg/ml ) for ten days following irradiation ( Henry Schein Animal Health , Dublin , OH ) . Supplical nutritional paste ( Henry Schein ) was also provided ad libitum to reduce weight loss . Systemic manifestations of GVHD were scored using established criteria ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) and ocular disease scored according to Table 2 . Corneal mechano-sensory function was measured on non-anesthetized mice with a Luneau Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer ( Western Ophthalmics , Lynwood , WA ) in 0 . 5 cm increments on a scale of 0 to 6 cm as previously described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Sensation scores reflect the longest filament length capable of eliciting replicate blink reflexes when applied to the central cornea . A Bioptigen spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) system ( Leica Microsystems , Buffalo Grove , IL ) was utilized to evaluate corneal inflammation and edema in vivo ( Downie et al . , 2014 ) . Digital photography of the external eye was captured with a Leica MZ16 FA stereomicroscope . Corneal nerves were imaged in flat-mounted corneal buttons as described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , corneas were harvested with the limbus intact , fixed , permeabilized , and labeled with Abcam anti-mouse beta-III tubulin primary antibody ( Cat . # ab18207 , Cambridge , MA ) and a corresponding AlexaFluor647-conjugated secondary antibody ( Cat . # 711-605-152 , Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) . Corneas were also labeled with an eBioscience FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3ε antibody ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) . Slides were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview1200 laser scanning confocal ( Center Valley , PA ) or a Nikon AR1 HD resonant scanning confocal ( Melville , NY ) microscope with sequential channel scanning . Confocal z-stack images were evaluated using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Concord , MA ) to quantify corneal nerves densities and the total numbers of CD3+ cells . Briefly , images were displayed as maximum intensity projections . Nerve volume per field of view was measured with the ‘create surface tool’ with manual thresholding for voxel area coverage of βIII tubulin+ fibers ( default parameters; smooth surface area detail set to 0 . 5 μm; background subtraction set to 8 . 0 μm ) . Total CD3+ cells were quantified using the spots tool with default parameters , an estimated cell diameter of 8 μm , and classification using the quality filter method with manual thresholding . Morphometric nerve volume and cell count summary statistics were reported by the software per image ( 20x field of view ) . Nerve densities were normalized to the respective control group average . Secondary lymphoid organs were harvested and mechanically processed into single-cell suspensions ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Blood was collected from the facial vein and treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer prior to labeling . Corneas were digested in RPMI1640 media containing 0 . 26 Wünsch units of Roche LiberaseTL enzyme blend ( Sigma Aldrich ) at 37° C as described ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Cell suspensions were filtered and labeled with Fc block and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies ( eBioscience ) . In vitro T cell functional assays were performed as previously described ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , cells were stimulated using 50 ng PMA and 800 ng ionomycin for three hours and monensin added after one hour ( BD Biosciences ) . Intracellular IFNγ expression was evaluated by flow cytometry using a BD cytofix/cytoperm staining kit . Samples were analyzed on a Miltenyi Biotec MacsQuant10 or a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer with MacsQuantify or FacsDiva software , respectively . For downstream gene expression studies , cornea digests were fractionated with Miltenyi microbeads by sequentially targeting CD45 ( Cat . # 130-052-301 ) and EpCAM ( Cat . # 130-105-958 ) as described ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . Alternatively , GFP-expressing cells were purified or depleted using a BioRad S3e cell sorter . Tissues were harvested and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1x Calbiochem protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore Sigma ) . Serum was obtained by collecting blood from the facial vein into BD microtainer serum separator tubes . Tissue homogenates and serum were clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000×g . Chemokine concentrations were determined using a BioRad Luminex system and Millipore Milliplex MAP technology . Concentrations of C3 were measured by ELISA ( Abcam , Cat . # ab157711 ) . Gene expression studies were performed using RNA isolated from tissue and cells using the Trizol ( ThermoFisher ) method and converted to cDNA with iScript ( BioRad ) . Real-time PCR was performed using PrimePCR technology with commercially validated primer sequences ( Biorad ) and a Biorad CFX-Connect thermocycler as directed . Relative expression was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCt method with GAPDH ( glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) as a reference gene . Final PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and imaged with an Azure Biosystems C-series gel documentation system ( Dublin , CA ) to confirm C3 expression in cell subsets . All data were evaluated using Prism six software ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Statistical tests and post hoc analyses utilized are listed in each figure legend . Significance thresholds are indicated as follows *=P < 0 . 05 , **=P < 0 . 01 , ***=P < 0 . 001 for all data . Supporting data are available online .",
         "Most people have likely experienced the discomfort of an eyelash falling onto the surface of their eye . Or that gritty sensation when dust blows into the eye and irritates the surface . These sensations are warnings from sensory nerves in the cornea , the transparent tissue that covers the iris and pupil . Corneal nerves help regulate blinking , and control production of the tear fluid that protects and lubricates the eye . But if the cornea suffers damage or infection , it can become inflamed . Long-lasting inflammation can damage the corneal nerves , leading to pain and vision loss . If scientists can identify how this happens , they may ultimately be able to prevent it . To this end , Royer et al . have used mice to study three causes of hard-to-treat corneal inflammation . The first is infection with herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) , which also causes cold sores . The second is eye allergy , where the immune system overreacts to substances like pollen or pet dander . And the third is graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , an immune disorder that can affect people who receive a bone marrow transplant . Royer et al . showed that HSV-1 infection and GVHD – but not allergies – made the mouse cornea less sensitive to touch . Consistent with this , microscopy revealed damage to corneal nerves in the mice with HSV-1 infection and those with GVHD . Further experiments showed that immune cells called CD4 T cells and a protein called complement C3 were contributing to this nerve damage . Treating the mice with an experimental drug derived from cobra venom protected the cornea from the harmful effects of inflammation . It did so by blocking activation of complement C3 at the eye surface . Identifying factors such as complement C3 that are responsible for corneal nerve damage is an important first step in helping patients with inflammatory eye diseases . Many drugs that target the complement pathway are currently under development . Some of these drugs could potentially be adapted for delivery as eye drops . But first , experiments must test whether complement also contributes to corneal nerve damage in humans . If it does , work can then begin on testing these drugs for safety and efficacy in patients .",

         "Variation in the presentation of hereditary immunodeficiencies may be explained by genetic or environmental factors . Patients with mutations in HOIL1 ( RBCK1 ) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency . We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation . However , they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii or Citrobacter rodentium . Increased susceptibility to Listeria was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines . In contrast , HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis or murine γ-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) , and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype . Surprisingly , chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1 , IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following Listeria infection . Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice , highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies .\nHOIL-1 ( encoded by the RBCK1 gene ) , HOIP ( RNF31 ) and SHARPIN form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( LUBAC ) , which linearly ubiquitinates receptor signaling complex components such as NEMO to enhance NF-κB activation after engagement of immune receptors including TNF-R1 , IL-1R , CD40 , TLRs and NOD2 ( Tokunaga et al . , 2011; Tokunaga et al . , 2009; Ikeda et al . , 2011; Gerlach et al . , 2011; Haas et al . , 2009; Zak et al . , 2011; Hostager et al . , 2011; Boisson et al . , 2012; Damgaard et al . , 2012; Tian et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , HOIL-1/LUBAC was also shown to be important for activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in macrophages via linear ubiquitination of ASC ( Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) . These data suggest that HOIL-1 plays multiple roles in inflammation and infection . In mice , SHARPIN deficiency results in auto-inflammation involving multiple organs including the liver , esophagus , lung and , most noticeably , chronic proliferative dermatitis of the skin ( Seymour et al . , 2007 ) . The development and organization of secondary lymphoid organs and antibody isotype switching are also impaired in these mice ( HogenEsch et al . , 1999 ) . Loss of HOIP catalytic activity in B cells results in the impaired development of B1 B cells and antibody responses to antigen ( Sasaki et al . , 2013 ) . However , HOIL-1-deficient mice have not been analyzed extensively to date . Sixteen patients with bi-allelic mutations in the gene encoding HOIL-1 have been reported ( Boisson et al . , 2012; Nilsson et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Three patients exhibited cardiomyopathy , amylopectinosis , hyper-inflammation and mild immunodeficiency associated with an increased frequency of bacterial infections , whereas other patients presented with amylopectinosis and myopathy alone ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The role of HOIL-1 in inflammation and immunity to infection in vivo is , therefore , uncertain . Although there are multiple possible explanations for the variable clinical presentations of the reported patients including hypomorphic expression of HOIL-1 or effects of mutations on protein function , another possibility was that environmental factors alter the clinical presentation of HOIL-1 deficiency . In this study we define the function of HOIL-1 in murine immunity to infection and explore the potential role of the virome in determining HOIL-1 deficiency-associated phenotypes . The bacterial microbiome and the virome regulate inflammation and immunity ( Virgin , 2014; Virgin et al . , 2009; Belkaid and Hand , 2014 ) . Within the virome , herpesviruses persistently infect most humans , and exert significant effects on innate immunity in mice during experimental chronic infection , including increasing resistance to tumors and a range of pathogens ( Barton et al . , 2007; White et al . , 2010; Yager et al . , 2009; Nguyen et al . , 2008; Haque et al . , 2004 ) . However , the potential effects of chronic infection on the phenotypic manifestations of immune deficiencies have not been considered . In this study , we show that chronic herpesvirus infection can alter the presentation of several genetic immunodeficiencies in mice . We first found that , in naïve mice , HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii and Citrobacter rodentium and for efficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to be essential for resistance to lethal infection by hematopoietic cells during Listeria infection . In contrast , HOIL-1 knock-out ( KO ) mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , were resistant to infection with murine γ-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although HOIL-1 KO mice raised in a barrier facility did not display signs of auto-inflammation , chronic infection with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis resulted in elevated inflammatory cytokines circulating in the serum , similar to that observed in some patients with mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) . Interestingly , latent infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 deficient mice from lethality during Listeria infection and induced high levels of the protective cytokine , interferon-gamma ( IFNγ ) . MHV68 latency also protected IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11 deficient mice from Listeria-induced lethality , indicating that the ability of latent infection to complement a genetic immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutation of Hoil-1 . These data indicate that chronic infections can modify the clinical presentations of genetic variations , thereby opening a new avenue for the analysis and interpretation of human genotype-phenotype association studies . We speculate that the protective effect of chronic herpesvirus infection is due to the stimulation of the function of the innate immune system in a manner that compensates for deficient early cytokine responses associated with multiple immunodeficiencies .\nHOIL-1 KO mice ( Tokunaga et al . , 2009 ) were born at Mendelian ratios and , in contrast to SHARPIN-deficient mice , failed to develop TNFα-driven inflammatory skin disease ( Ikeda et al . , 2011; Gerlach et al . , 2011; Tokunaga et al . , 2011; Tokunaga and Iwai , 2012 ) and exhibited normal histology of lymphoid organs , liver , lung , and kidney , and the presence of Peyer's patches along the small intestine ( not shown ) . Aged HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited deposits of material that stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and was resistant to digestion with diastase , similar to the amylopectin-like material observed in humans with HOIL-1 deficiency ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , these barrier-raised mice showed minimal signs of baseline hyper-inflammation . In this regard , HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited normal numbers of lymphoid and myeloid cells in the spleen and thymus , normal complete blood counts ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A , B , D ) , and no detectable increase of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) or interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) in serum ( discussed below ) . However , in the peritoneum , HOIL-1 KO mice contained about twofold more B cells , T cells and resident macrophages without changes in other cell types ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) . Expression of neighboring genes , Trib3 and Tbc1d20 , was unaffected by disruption of the Rbck1 ( Hoil1 ) gene ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . To determine the requirement for HOIL-1 during the immune response to infection in vivo , we challenged HOIL-1 KO mice with a number of different pathogens . Strikingly , HOIL-1 KO mice were highly susceptible to even low dose infection with the facultative gram-positive intracellular bacterium , Listeria monocytogenes ( Listeria ) , with 80% , 80% and 50% of mice succumbing to infection within 10 days of intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) inoculation with 105 , 104 and 103 CFU , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Although bacterial burdens in the spleens and livers of control and HOIL-1 KO mice were similar 1 and 3 days post-infection with 105 CFU , bacterial CFUs were elevated in HOIL-1 KO mice by 6 days post-infection , indicating that HOIL-1 KO mice were unable to control and clear the bacteria ( Figure 1B ) . Further , these mutant mice developed large inflammatory lesions in the liver , elevated liver enzymes in the serum , and widespread tissue destruction in the spleen ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 , not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 006Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 011 HOIL-1 KO mice were also highly susceptible to infection with a relatively avirulent type II strain of the intracellular apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii ( T . gondii ) ( Figure 1C ) . Despite infection with 5000 parasites resulting in lethality in only 20% of control mice , 100 parasites was sufficient to induce lethality in 100% of HOIL-1 KO mice . Quantification of parasite-encoded luciferase expression in vivo revealed that HOIL-1 KO mice failed to control T . gondii replication by 8 days post-infection ( Figure 1D ) . HOIL-1 KO mice also succumbed to infection with the enteric gram-negative pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , whereas control mice were highly resistant ( Figure 1E , F ) . These data indicated that loss of HOIL-1 expression confers profound immunodeficiency in barrier-raised mice . To define the role of HOIL-1 in immunity , we examined the response to Listeria in more detail . One patient with HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency showed signs of recovery from hyper-inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . In mice , reciprocal bone marrow transplantation revealed that expression of HOIL-1 in radiation-sensitive hematopoietic cells was critical for resistance to Listeria ( Figure 2A , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We noted that control mice that received control bone marrow were slightly more susceptible to infection than non-irradiated control mice ( compare with Figure 1A ) , suggesting that reconstitution does not fully restore the immune system of a lethally irradiated mouse to that of a non-irradiated animal . Despite this caveat , irradiated wild-type control mice that received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow and were challenged with 105 Listeria 8 weeks later succumbed to infection at the same rate as HOIL-1 KO mice that had received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow . HOIL-1 KO mice that received control bone marrow had an increased survival rate , but still succumbed more readily than control mice that received control bone marrow . These data indicate that , while HOIL-1 expression is essential in bone marrow-derived cells , HOIL-1 may also play a role in radiation resistant cells during Listeria infection . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 012Figure 2 .

Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison test . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 014 To determine whether HOIL-1 deficiency resulted in a defect in innate or adaptive immunity , we bred the HOIL-1 KO mice onto a RAG1-deficient background . T and B cell-deficient RAG1 HOIL-1 double KO mice succumbed to infection significantly faster than RAG1 KO mice ( Figure 2B ) , and exhibited elevated bacterial burden in the spleen and liver 3 days post-infection ( Figure 2C ) , indicating that HOIL-1 plays an essential role in innate immunity during Listeria infection . Indeed , HOIL-1-deficient mice succumbed to infection at the same rate regardless of the presence or absence of the adaptive immune system ( compare Figures 1A and 2B ) . Further , HOIL-1 KO mice immunized with a low dose of Listeria were capable of mounting a protective adaptive response to a high dose secondary challenge with Listeria 28 days later ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . We noted that 1000 CFU administered i . p . was a borderline dose required to successfully immunize control mice in our experiments , despite being sufficient to induce lethality in 50% of HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 1A ) . Together , these data do not rule out a role for HOIL-1 in adaptive immunity , but show that HOIL-1 plays a major role in hematopoietic cells to foster innate immunity to Listeria infection . Innate immunity to Listeria in mice depends on tissue-resident macrophages and CD8α+ dendritic cells responding to Listeria infection by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα , IL-12 , and IL-6 . These cytokines are each well recognized to be essential for survival after Listeria infection ( Unanue , 1997; Williams et al . , 2012 ) through their role in coordinating activation of NK cells , NKT cell and T cells to produce IFNγ required for the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells . Therefore , to further define a role for HOIL-1 in the innate immune system , we determined whether HOIL-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages ( macrophages herein ) produced cytokines in response to Listeria infection with or without IFNγ treatment . Compared to control cells , HOIL-1 KO macrophages secreted only 50% , 20% and 10% of the expected levels of TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12p70 protein , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Consistent with a role for HOIL-1 in the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor following TLR stimulation , Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO macrophages expressed decreased levels of Tnf , Il6 and Il12b mRNA ( Figure 3B ) . The defects in cytokine transcript levels were of smaller magnitude than the decreases in secreted protein , particularly for Tnf , suggesting that HOIL-1 may also be involved in cytokine translation or secretion . However , HOIL-1 KO macrophages killed Listeria after activation with IFNγ as effectively as control cells , indicating the selectivity of HOIL-1 effects on macrophage function ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 015Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 018 We confirmed that induction of Tnf and Il6 mRNA was significantly impaired following Listeria infection in vivo by measuring cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from mice 3 to 12 hr after infection ( Figure 3C ) . This reduction in cytokine transcripts could not be explained by a decrease in macrophage numbers ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Surprisingly , Il12b transcript levels were similar in HOIL-1 KO mice , with a significant difference being detected at only 6 hr after infection . Similar decreases in Tnf and Il6 mRNA were observed in mice on the Rag1−/− background at 3 hr post-infection , confirming that these differences are due to a defect in innate immunity in the absence of HOIL-1 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . We also noted that fewer NK cells and neutrophils were present in the peritoneum 6 hr after Listeria infection , suggesting delayed recruitment or proliferation of these cell types ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . These decreases in cytokine production and delayed cell recruitment likely synergize with defects in IL-1β and TNFα signaling observed by others ( Tian et al . , 2007; Haas et al . , 2009; Tokunaga et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) to compromise antibacterial immunity , and may contribute to the impaired induction of Ifng mRNA observed by 12 hr ( Figure 3C ) . These data indicate that HOIL-1 plays a critical role in coordinating essential early cytokine responses after Listeria infection . The above data demonstrate that HOIL-1 KO mice have a severe immunodeficiency after certain types of infection . To assess the generality of this phenotype we infected HOIL-1 KO mice with murine γ-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) , a genetic relative of the common persistent human herpesviruses , Epstein–Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( EBV , KSHV ) ( Barton et al . , 2011; Speck and Ganem , 2010 ) . HOIL-1 KO mice survived MHV68 infection for at least 3 months . MHV68 replication was unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency in cultured macrophages , and was suppressed only slightly in vivo ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Despite normal establishment of latency as determined by the number of cells carrying MHV68 genome 28 days after infection ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , the efficiency of MHV68 reactivation from latency in explanted peritoneal cells was significantly impaired ( approximately 50-fold , Figure 4A ) . Similarly , HOIL-1 KO mice failed to succumb to infection with M . tuberculosis over 70 days of infection , and in fact exhibited lower bacterial colony counts in the spleen while counts in the lung were no different than controls ( Figure 4B ) . Thus HOIL-1 KO mice are fully able to control , and may have an enhanced ability to control , specific aspects of acute and chronic MHV68 and M . tuberculosis infection , in striking contrast to the immunodeficiency apparent after infection with Listeria , Toxoplasma , and Citrobacter . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 003Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 005 The ability of HOIL-1 KO mice to effectively control chronic herpesvirus infection allowed us to test the hypothesis that persistent virus infection might alter two phenotypes , hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency , in which HOIL-1 KO mice appear to differ from some reported patients with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , patients with HOIL-1 deficiency and hyper-inflammation exhibited increased expression of IL-6 and TNFα in the serum and increased expression of mRNA for Il6 in blood cells ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore examined the serum of MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice for cytokines essential for resistance to Listeria but deficient in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . As previously observed ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , latent infection of control mice with MHV68 was associated with an increase in circulating levels of TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFNγ compared with uninfected mice ( Figure 4C ) . In HOIL-1 KO mice , MHV68 latently resulted in small but significant increases in TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels , and a more striking increase in IFNγ levels compared to latently infected controls . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with M . tuberculosis also exhibited increased expression of both IL-6 and TNFα in serum at 70 days post-infection ( Figure 4D ) . Therefore , there is an overlap between cytokines expressed in hyper-inflammatory patients and in chronically-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . MHV68 latency has been shown previously to induce symbiotic protection against Listeria infection in wild-type mice ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) . Because expression of TNFα , IL-6 and IFNγ are essential for control of Listeria infection in mice ( Kopf et al . , 1994; Unanue , 1997; Williams et al . , 2012 ) , and were impaired in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 3C ) , but elevated in MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice , we considered whether chronic MHV68 infection could complement the profound immunodeficiency observed in Listeria-infected barrier-raised HOIL-1 KO mice . As observed previously ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency , 1 month after infection , protected control mice from an otherwise lethal dose of Listeria ( Figure 5A ) . MHV68 latency also protected HOIL-1 KO mice from a dose of Listeria at least 1000-fold higher than the LD50 for MHV68-negative mice ( Figures 5A and 1A ) . Both control and HOIL-1 KO mice were still partially protected from Listeria challenge 6 months after MHV68 infection ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . A viral mutant capable of acute lytic infection but unable to efficiently establish latency ( ORF73 . stop ) ( Moorman et al . , 2003 ) was unable to efficiently protect HOIL-1 KO or control mice from Listeria infection , demonstrating that latent MHV68 is required to complement HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency to Listeria ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 019Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 022 To determine whether MHV68 latency rescued pro-inflammatory cytokine induction by HOIL-1 KO mice following Listeria infection , we quantitated cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from latently infected mice before ( Figure 5C ) and 3 hr after ( Figure 5D ) infection with Listeria . As predicted from the cytokine levels in the serum , MHV68 latency resulted in small but significant increases in Tnf , Il6 and Il12b transcripts prior to Listeria challenge ( Figure 5C ) . While MHV68 latency did not rescue the induction of Tnf or Il6 transcripts in HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria , Il12b transcript levels were increased approximately twofold , and were comparable to levels in control mice . More significantly , Ifng and Nos2 ( encoding iNOS ) transcripts were elevated approximately 200-fold and 1000-fold , respectively , in latently infected control and HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 5C ) , and further induced by 3 hr after infection with Listeria ( Figure 5D ) . Ifng transcript levels were significantly higher in latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria than in control mice . These data suggest that MHV68 latency by-passes the requirement for TNFα and IL-6 during early Listeria infection by enhancing the induction of IFNγ and downstream effector molecules important for controlling Listeria infection . To test whether peritoneal macrophages from latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice had an increased capacity to kill Listeria , we explanted peritoneal macrophages from mock or latently infected mice , infected them with Listeria , killed extracellular bacteria with gentamycin treatment , and compared the number of CFU at 6 hr to the number of CFU at the beginning of the experiment . As expected , cells from mock infected control mice exhibited mild listericidal activity and cells from latently infected control mice had an enhanced ability to kill Listeria ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 , ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) ) . Macrophages from mock-infected HOIL-1 KO mice had a slightly impaired ability to control Listeria infection . However , MHV68 latency in HOIL-1 KO mice enhanced the ability of macrophages to kill Listeria , generating a capacity to kill similar to that observed with macrophages from control mice . Together , these data suggest that MHV68 latency induces an environment that enhances the ability of HOIL-1-deficient cells to kill and respond to Listeria . To determine whether the viral complementation of immunodeficiency was unique to HOIL-1 , we latently infected IL-6 , Caspase-1-deficient and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-double-deficient mice ( Kayagaki et al . , 2013 ) , which survive MHV68 infection but are all highly susceptible to Listeria infection ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) ( Kopf et al . , 1994; Sarawar et al . , 1998; Edelson and Unanue , 2002; Tsuji et al . , 2004; Sauer et al . , 2011 ) . IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice were also protected from lethality following Listeria infection by chronic MHV68 infection ( Figure 5E , F ) . These data indicate that the capacity of chronic MHV68 to reverse a significant immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutations in Rbck1 ( Hoil1 ) , and suggest that chronic viral infections may alter phenotypes of many host allelic variants .\nWe report that HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria , T . gondii and C . rodentium , but not with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis in mice . Expression of HOIL-1 was critical in innate , hematopoietic-derived cells during Listeria infection in vivo . The requirement of HOIL-1 for the induction of protective inflammatory cytokines , TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12 , following infection of macrophages with Listeria in vitro is consistent with reports that LUBAC is required for efficient NF-κB activation following TLR engagement ( Zak et al . , 2011; Boisson et al . , 2012 ) , but not with a recent report that NF-κB activation following stimulation of TLR4 and TNF-R1 on macrophages by LPS and TNFα , respectively , is unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency ( Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) . These apparently conflicting results suggest that HOIL-1 and LUBAC may not only have cell-type specific functions ( Boisson et al . , 2012; Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) , but also stimulus-specific roles that vary between different cell types . This may be further highlighted by the excessive inflammatory response and enhanced control of MHV68 and M . tuberculosis infection—two pathogens that also infect macrophages—by HOIL-1-deficient mice . It has been proposed that low levels of viral reactivation during MHV68 latency are responsible for the low level of constant immune activation and cytokine production ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) . It is paradoxical , then , that reactivation is almost undetectable in HOIL-1-deficient animals , and yet their inflammatory response is elevated . Since the negative regulator of NF-κB signaling , A20 , binds to linear ubiquitin chains ( Tokunaga et al . , 2012; Verhelst et al . , 2012 ) , HOIL-1/LUBAC may also be important for recruiting A20 to receptor signaling complexes to turn off signaling . Therefore , receptor signaling may be sustained in cells in HOIL-1 KO mice , resulting in the increase in TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12 , and ultimately IFNγ protein , observed in the serum of chronically infected mice . Decreased viral reactivation may be the result of this increased IFNγ , the inability of latently infected cells to response to a stimulus of reactivation or a combination thereof . It is unclear why HOIL-1 KO mice are extremely susceptible to some pathogens , yet control other infections remarkably well . This might be due to HOIL-1/LUBAC having differential roles in transducing signals from different immune sensors stimulated by different infections . Other possibilities include a differential requirement for the innate immune system to hold the acute infection in check while an adaptive response is being generated , the speed at which the pathogen replicates , the tissues that it damages , and whether pathology during acute infection is mostly immune- or pathogen-derived . Further studies will be required to address these possibilities . We further show that chronic infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 , IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice from lethal Listeria infection , thereby masking the genetic immunodeficiency observed in MHV68-negative mice . As reported previously ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFNγ in the serum of wild-type animals , which were further increased in HOIL-1 KO mice . These cytokines appear to increase the activation status of the innate immune system such that their induction following Listeria infection is no longer as important as would be the case in a naïve mouse . Indeed , MHV68 infection did not enhance the transcription of Tnf , and only marginally enhanced the transcription of Il6 and Il12b even in control mice following Listeria infection , and did not rescue the defect in Tnf and Il6 induction observed in HOIL-1 KO mice . Conversely , transcription of Ifng and the effector molecule , iNOS ( encoded by Nos2 ) , was elevated in cells from latently infected mice and enhanced substantially by both HOIL-1 KO and control animals very rapidly following infection with Listeria . Macrophages require priming with IFNγ to induce IL-12 in response to Listeria infection . In a latently infected animal , IFNγ is already present and so IL-12 and additional IFNγ may be induced more rapidly . Furthermore , as reported previously for wild-type mice ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency enhanced the ability of peritoneal macrophages from control and HOIL-1 KO mice to kill Listeria . Together , these data suggest that the constant presence of low levels of IFNγ driven by latent virus infection results in an increase in the basal expression levels of downstream effector molecules and the priming of cells for the enhanced immediate killing of Listeria upon infection , as well as for a more rapid further induction of IFNγ and its effector molecules in response to the bacterial challenge . In this sense , chronic virus infection sets the level of innate immunity to subsequent infection . HOIL-1 KO mice bred in a high grade barrier facility failed to exhibit certain phenotypes of HOIL-1 deficient patients , specifically by not exhibiting baseline hyper-inflammation and by displaying a striking immunodeficiency out of proportion to that observed in some humans with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) . Most humans are infected life-long with multiple herpesviruses ( Virgin et al . , 2009; Virgin , 2014 ) , and many also carry other chronic or latent infections such as tuberculosis . Importantly , we observed complementation of immunodeficiency to Listeria by chronic herpesvirus infection in four different strains of immunodeficient mice , revealing virus infection as one possible environmental factor that might alter the genotype-phenotype relationship for patients with mutations in immune system genes . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with either a herpesvirus or M . tuberculosis also exhibited increases in some of the same cytokines reported in the serum of HOIL-1 deficient humans . At least three of the HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with at least one herpesvirus ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) , and it is likely that other chronic infections were present . However , in the absence of data regarding the complete infection status of the HOIL-1 mutant patients , the relevance of the mouse studies to the human phenotypes is unclear . Nevertheless , perhaps the presence of the virome , and potentially variations in the virome or other chronic infections between people , confers significant phenotypic variation by complementing mutations in host genes responsible for innate immunity ( Virgin , 2014 ) . The genes involved in immunity and inflammation are the most rapidly evolving in the mammalian genome ( Lindblad-Toh et al . , 2011; Casanova et al . , 2013; Quintana-Murci and Clark , 2013 ) . Survival from infection requires a trade-off between alleles that promote or limit inflammation to balance immunity vs immunopathology . We speculate that the virome or other chronic infections hide or enhance the effects of genetic variations in immune responsiveness by complementing chromosomal variations in immune response genes . As the nature of the virome changes in persons growing up in different cultural and economic environments , it is possible that the immunophenotype of the host changes , and the beneficial or deleterious effects of existing genetic variation are unmasked by removal of complementation provided by chronic virus infection . It is also plausible that the striking auto-inflammation observed in humans with a variety of immune defects could be due to even well controlled herpesvirus infection alone or in combination with other chronic infections . Our data suggest that analysis of the metagenome , including the virome , may be of value in linking human phenotype and genotype ( Virgin , 2014; Virgin and Todd , 2011 ) . Recent rapid advances in sequencing and analysis of the metagenome will make integration of data from the virome into human genetic studies practical ( Virgin , 2014 ) .\nHOIL-1 KO mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , have been described previously ( Tokunaga et al . , 2009 ) .

To determine tissue burden , spleens and livers were homogenized in 10 ml PBS containing 0 . 05% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates . Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . Small sections of spleen and liver were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological analysis . The type II Prugniaud strain of T . gondii expressing a firefly luciferase ( PRU-Fluc-GFP , provided by J . Boothroyd , Stanford University , Palo Alto , CA ) ( Saeij et al . , 2005 ) was used in all in vivo T . gondii experiments . Tachyzoites were grown by 2-day serial passage in human foreskin fibroblasts . For infections , freshly egressed parasites were filtered , counted , and injected i . p . into mice . Mice were with inoculated orally with 2 × 109 CFU C . rodentium strain DBS100 ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) from a fresh culture and monitored for morbidity and mortality . MHV68 WUMS ( ATCC VR1465 ) , MHV68 ORF73 . stop and γHV68 M3-Fluc were passaged and titered by plaque assay on NIH 3T12 cells . Virus stocks were stored at −80 °C , and thawed and diluted into PBS for i . p . or intranasal ( i . n . ) inoculation of mice . For experiments involving MHV68 ORF73 . stop , i . n . inoculation with 5 × 104 CFU was performed due to the low titer of the virus stock . To determine γHV68 titers in tissues , organs were placed in 1 ml of complete DMEM and frozen at −80°C . Samples were thawed prior to disruption with silica beads and virus titration by plaque assay . Before infection , exponentially replicating M . tuberculosis Erdman strain bacteria were washed in PBS + 0 . 05% Tween 80 , and sonicated to disperse clumps . Mice were exposed to 8 × 107 CFU of M . tuberculosis in an Inhalation Exposure System ( Glas-Col , Terre Haute , IN ) , which delivers ∼100 bacteria to the lung per animal . After 24 hr post infection , two mice per group were sacrificed , and lungs were harvested to determine infection efficiency , which was about 100 CFU/lung/mouse . Experimental mice were sacrificed 70 days after infection , and lungs and spleen were harvested for CFU , and serum was collected for cytokine analysis . Bacterial burdens were determined by plating serial dilutions of lung and spleen homogenates onto 7H10 agar plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 weeks prior to counting colonies . MHV68 reactivation from latency and preformed virus was assayed as described previously ( Weck et al . , 1996 ) . Briefly , peritoneal exudate cells were plated in twofold serial dilutions ( 24-wells per dilution ) onto permissive mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) monolayers and scored for cytopathic effect ( CPE ) 3 weeks later . Reactivation of lytic virus from a peritoneal cell leads to complete CPE of the MEF monolayer . To measure preformed infectious virus in the sample , parallel samples of cells were mechanically disrupted to kill the cells but keep any infectious virus intact . These samples were plated and scored as described above . Using the Poisson distribution , CPE in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one reactivation event is likely to have occurred per well , and is used to determine the frequency of reactivating cells in the sample . To determine the frequency of cells harboring viral genome , peritoneal cells were assayed by nested PCR for viral genome as described previously ( Weck et al . , 1999 ) . The detection of PCR product in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one genome was present per well . Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously ( Hwang et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , bone marrow was extracted from mouse femurs and allowed to differentiate in DMEM containing 10% FBS , 10% CMG14-12 cell-conditioned media as a source of M-CSF ( Takeshita et al . , 2000 ) , 5% horse serum , 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L-Glutamine for 7 days . For cytokine and transcript analyses following Listeria infection of macrophages , adherent cells were scraped and seeded in tissue culture-treated plates in the absence of M-CSF . After 3 days , macrophages were infected with 106/ml Listeria in the presence or absence of 100 U/ml IFNγ . 2 hr post-infection , 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin were added to kill the Listeria . Cell supernatants were harvested at indicated times and frozen at −80 °C prior to cytokine analysis . Cells were lyzed in TRI-Reagent for RNA extraction . For Listeria growth/killing assays , macrophages were seeded in non-tissue culture treated dishes in the absence of M-CSF . After 1 day , cells were treated with 300 µ/ml IFNγ or untreated , and 48 hr later scraped replated on sterile coverslips . After 3 hr , cells were infected with 105/ml Listeria from an overnight standing culture and centifuged to synchronize the infection . 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . At the indicated times , coverslips were washed with warm PBS , then lyzed in 10 ml cold water to release the bacteria . Serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates , and Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . For MHV68 growth analysis , adherent cells were scraped and seeded in tissue culture-treated plates in the presence of M-CSF . After 2 days , macrophages were treated with 0 . 1 U/ml IFNγ or untreated , and 12 hr later infected with MHV68 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 05 for 1 hr with occasional rocking at 37°C and 5% CO2 . Cells were washed once with medium and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine ( with or without 0 . 1 U/ml IFNγ ) for the indicated period of time at 37°C and 5% CO2 , before being frozen at −80 °C . Virus titers were determined by plaque assay following two freeze–thaw cycles . Cells were flushed from the peritoneum of mice that had been mock infected or infected with MHV68 for 32 days with ice cold DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine . 5 × 105 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24 well plates in duplicate wells per timepoint and allowed to adhere overnight . Non-adherent cells were washed away with warm medium , and the remaining cells were infected with 105 CFU Listeria from a overnight standing culture by spinocculation at 600×g for 10 min at room temperature , and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 . 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . Coverslips were washed in warm PBS prior to hypotonic lysis of the cells in ice cold water to release the bacteria . Serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates , and Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . Recipient mice were exposed to 1200 rad of whole body irradiation , and injected intravenously with 10 million whole bone marrow cells from donor mice . Mice were allowed to reconstitute for 8 to 10 weeks before Listeria challenge . Mice were bled at 7 weeks post-irradiation to determine percent chimerism . Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) for the presence of Rbck1/Hoil1 intron 7 ( in control cells; 5′-ATG CTG GAG TAG AGG CTG GA-3′ and 5′-TGA CTG CTG CTT GGA GAG TG-3′ ) , or the neomycin-resistance cassette ( in HOIL-1 KO cells; 5′-CAA GAT GGA TTG CAC GCA GG-3′ and 5′-GCA GCC GAT TGT CTG TTG TG-3′ ) . Rag2 was used as a normalization control ( 5′-GGG AGG ACA CTC ACT TGC CAG TA-3′ and 5′-AGT CAG GAG TCT CCA TCT CAC TGA-3′ ) . Imaging was performed as described previously ( Saeij et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , mice were injected i . p . with 150 mg/kg D-Luciferin ( Biosynth AG , Switzerland ) and allowed to remain active for 5 min . Animals were subsequently anesthetized with 2% isoflurane for 5 min and then imaged with a Xenogen IVIS 200 machine ( Caliper Life Sciences , Hopkinton , MA ) . Data were analyzed using Living Image software ( Caliper Life Sciences ) . Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage with 10 ml ice cold FACS buffer ( PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 µg/ml Streptomycin ) . Splenocytes were isolated by filtering through two 100 μm cell strainers into 10 ml ice cold FACS buffer . Residual red blood cells were lysed with Red Blood Cell lysis buffer ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , counted and stained for flow cytometry . Cells were incubated with FACS buffer plus 1% rat serum , 1% hamster serum and 1% Fc-block for 15 min . Surface staining was performed for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were then washed and fixed with 2% formaldehyde . Cells were analyzed on an LSRII or LSR Fortessa flow cytometer ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Inc , Ashland , OR ) . The following antibodies were used: anti-CD3e ( clone 145-2C11 , Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) , anti-CD4 ( clone RM4-5 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD8 ( clone 53-6 . 7 , Biolegend ) , anti-IgM ( clone II/41 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD19 ( clone 6D5 , Biolegend ) , anti-NK1 . 1 ( clone PK136 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-NKp46 ( clone 29A1 . 4 , eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone HK1 . 4 , Biolegend ) , anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , Biolgend , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-F4/80 ( clone BM8 , Biolegend ) . Cytokines in mouse serum and cell supernatants were quantitated using a custom Procarta Immunoassay Kit ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) and analyzed on a Bio-Plex 200 System ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) or by ELISA ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , respectively , according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Spleen sections were homogenized , and macrophages were lysed in TRI-Reagent ( Sigma ) , and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions to isolate total RNA . RNA was isolated from peritoneal cells using RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Netherlands ) . RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNA-free DNase ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) prior to first strand cDNA synthesis with ImProm-II ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and random hexamer primers . Quantitative PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus machine using Power SYBR Green master mix ( Applied Biosystems , Waltham , MA ) and primers specific for ribosomal protein S29 ( Rps29; 5′-AGC AGC TCT ACT GGA GTC ACC-3′ and 5′-AGG TCG CTT AGT CCA ACT TAA TG-3′ ) , Rbck1/Hoil-1 ( 5′-ATT CGG CGG AAT GGA GAC GG-3′ and 5′-CTG GTT GGT CCT GGG CTT CG-3′ ) , Trib3 ( 5′-CAC ACT GCC ACA AGC ACG GG-3′ and 5′-CAC GCA GGC ATC TTC CAG G-3′ ) , Tbc1d20 ( 5′-TGA GGG AGG GCT CCT GAC TG-3′ and 5′-AGC AGC ACT TGC TGG TAG TCC-3′ ) , Il12b ( 5′-GCA CGG CAG CAG AAT AAA TAT GAG-3′ and 5′-TTC AAA GGC TTC ATC TGC AAG TTC-3′ ) , Tnf ( 5′-GGG TGA TCG GTC CCC AAA GG-3′ and 5′- CTG AGT GTG AGG GTC TGG GC-3′ ) , Il6 ( 5′-GCC AGA GTC CTT CAG AGA GAT ACA-3′ and 5′-CTT GGT CCT TAG CCA CTC CTT C-3′ ) , Ifng ( 5′-ATG AAC GCT ACA CAC TGC ATC-3′ and 5′-CCA TCC TTT TGC CAG TTC CTC-3′ ) and iNos ( Nos2 ) ( 5′-GTT CTC AGC CCA ACA ATA CAA GA-3′ and 5′-GTG GAC GGG TCG ATG TCA C-3′ ) . Transcript levels were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method , with Rps29 as the reference gene . Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin followed by 70% ethanol , paraffin embedded , sectioned and stained with Periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS ) . Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were measured on a Liasys 330 ( AMS Diagnostics , Weston , FL ) , complete blood counts were measured on a Hemavet 1700 ( Drew Scientific , Waterbury , CT ) , and white blood cell differential counts were performed by Washington University Division of Comparative Medicine Animal Diagnostic Laboratory staff . Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism software . The specific tests performed are noted in the figure legends .",
         "The immune system protects an individual from invading bacteria , viruses and parasites , as well as malfunctioning or cancerous host cells . However , some people inherit genetic defects that cause part of the immune system to be missing or to not work properly . This is called a genetic immunodeficiency , and puts individuals at a higher risk of infection and disease . The symptoms of immunodeficiencies can vary substantially between individuals , even when they have defects in the same gene . For example , only some of the individuals who have defects in both of their copies of a gene called HOIL-1—which has been linked to several roles in the body's immune response—are reported to suffer from an altered susceptibility to bacterial infections and chronic ( persistent ) inflammation . Gaining a clear understanding of the possible factors that influence such variations in the symptoms of genetic immune deficiencies could help to speed up their diagnosis , as well as helping to develop more effective treatments . MacDuff et al . studied mice that had mutations in both copies of the mouse equivalent of the HOIL-1 gene . These mice , when raised in a clean barrier facility that reduces their exposure to viruses , were severely immunodeficient and died when infected by certain bacteria and parasites , including Listeria monocytogenes . However , they were able to tolerate infections with a herpesvirus or the bacterium that causes tuberculosis . The immunodeficiency to L . monocytogenes was linked to problems producing protective molecules called cytokines , which form a crucial part of the immune response . Unexpectedly , MacDuff et al . found that a chronic herpesvirus infection substantially protected these very immunodeficient animals from infection with Listeria monocytogenes , and the mice were able to efficiently produce protective cytokines . Mice with two other distinct genetic deficiencies that affect their immune system were also better able to survive otherwise lethal bacterial infections if they had a long-term herpesvirus infection . Macduff et al . suggest that the chronic herpesvirus infection stimulates the immune system , and so allows it to compensate for the lack of cytokine production associated with various immunodeficiencies , including those caused by mutations in the HOIL-1 gene . This suggests that the presence of viruses or other long-term infections may be responsible for some of the variability seen in the symptoms of different individuals with the same genetic immunodeficiency . This is an important concept since essentially all humans have life-long chronic infections from various herpesviruses , as well as other viruses that form the human virome .",

         "Rapid and flexible interpretation of conflicting sensory inputs in the context of current goals is a critical component of cognitive control that is orchestrated by frontal cortex . The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood . To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions , we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict . We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times . These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) , followed by medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) and then by orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics , and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex .\nFlexible control of cognitive processes is fundamental to daily activities , including the execution of goal-directed tasks according to stimulus inputs and context dependencies . An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . A canonical example of this type of conflict is the Stroop task: subjects are asked to name the font color of a word where the semantic meaning conflicts with the color signal ( e . g . the word 'red' shown in green versus red ) . Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times , attributed to weaker signals ( color processing ) that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information ( Stroop , 1935 ) . The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control . Neurophysiological , neuroimaging , and lesion studies have ascribed a critical role in cognitive control to networks within frontal cortex ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) , yet the neural circuit dynamics and mechanisms responsible for orchestrating control processes remain poorly understood . Lesion studies ( Cohen and Servan-Schreiber , 1992; Perrett , 1974 ) , human neuroimaging measurements ( Egner and Hirsch , 2005a; MacDonald , 2000 ) , and macaque single unit recordings ( Johnston et al . , 2007 ) implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . The medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) also participates in cognitive control , possibly in a conflict monitoring capacity ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ( Ito et al . , 2003; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments ( Brown and Braver , 2005; Ito et al . , 2003; Johnston et al . , 2007; Rothé et al . , 2011 ) —an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) . An alternative and influential theoretical framework posits that the ACC monitors for potential conflicts and subsequently directs the dlPFC to engage control processes ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006; Kerns et al . , 2004; MacDonald , 2000 ) but the relative contributions of dlPFC , mFC , and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate ( Aarts et al . , 2008; Cole et al . , 2009; Fellows and Farah , 2005; Mansouri et al . , 2007; Milham and Banich , 2005; Milham et al . , 2003; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Previously , some neuroimaging studies have suggested that these frontal cortex regions can be differentiated based on the presence or absence of conflict signals ( MacDonald , 2000 ) . The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions ( attention , decision-making , uncertainty , cognitive control ) . These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques ( Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control . We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses . We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color . We observed conflict-selective activity throughout several regions in frontal cortex: ACC , mFC , dlPFC , and also orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control . Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials , and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time , depended on the task , and exhibited adaptation over trials . We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence . Conflict responses emerged first in the ACC and subsequently emerged in dlPFC and mFC and finally in OFC . These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control .\nWe focused on 469 electrodes located in areas within frontal lobe which have been previously implicated in executive function: medial frontal cortex ( mFC , n = 111 ) , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC , n = 156 ) , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC , n = 168 ) and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC , n = 34 ) . We applied a non-parametric analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to measure whether and when the physiological responses differed between congruent and incongruent trials . An electrode was considered conflict-selective if the F-statistic was greater than a significance threshold computed by a permutation test with P = 0 . 001 for 50 consecutive milliseconds ( Materials and methods ) . The latency was defined as the first time of this threshold-crossing . Figure 2 shows an example electrode from the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex that responded differentially between congruent and incongruent trials during the Stroop task . These signals were better aligned to the speech onset than to the stimulus onset , as shown in the response-aligned view ( compare Figure 2A–C with Figure 2D–F ) . During the Stroop task , the response-aligned signals were significantly stronger for the incongruent ( brown ) trials compared to the congruent ( black ) trials ( Figure 2D , P < 10–5 , ANOVA ) , and were invariant to the particular word/color combinations ( Figure 2G ) . Incongruent trials could be discriminated from congruent trials at a latency of 669 ± 31 ms ( mean ± s . e . m . ) before the onset of the response ( Figure 2D ) . This conflict response was also specific to the Stroop task; there was a significant interaction between congruency and task ( F = 13 . 5 , P = 0 . 007 , ANOVA ) . The same stimuli did not elicit differential activity during the Reading task ( Figure 2F ) . We assessed the correlation between the neural signal strength and behavioral reaction times in single trials . The maximal gamma power during each incongruent trial ( using the average gamma power yielded similar results ) was positively correlated with the behavioral reaction times ( Figure 2H , ρ = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 02 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 006Figure 2 . Example electrode in left Anterior Cingulate Cortex . ( A ) Average gamma power signals aligned to the stimulus onset from an electrode during the Stroop task , for congruent ( black ) or incongruent ( brown ) stimuli . For display purposes only , we z-scored the gamma power by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation of power during the baseline period ( 500 ms prior to stimulus onset ) . Shaded areas indicate s . e . m . The total number of trials for each condition is indicated in the upper right . ( B ) Single-trial data for congruent ( left ) and incongruent ( right ) trials .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 009 Any differences between congruent and incongruent trials in the stimulus-aligned analyses can be confounded by the reaction time differences; therefore , we focus subsequent analyses on the response-aligned signals . More example electrodes are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ( dlPFC ) and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ( OFC ) . Using the aforementioned criteria , we identified n = 51 conflict selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Stroop task , with contributions from 13 subjects ( Supplementary files 2 and 3 ) . These electrodes were distributed throughout different subregions within frontal cortex ( Figure 3A ) . To evaluate whether random variation in the signals could give rise to apparent conflict-selective electrodes , we randomly shuffled the congruent/incongruent trial labels 10 , 000 times and applied the same statistical criteria ( Materials and methods ) . Across our population , we found n = 4 . 4 ± 0 . 03 false positive electrodes ( mean ± s . e . m . , out of 469 electrodes ) , which corresponds to a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of q = 0 . 01 , which is significantly less than our observation of n = 51 electrodes . The number of conflict-selective electrodes within each subregion was significantly greater than expected by chance ( Figure 3B , P < 0 . 01 , all regions ) . We repeated the analyses during the Reading task . In contrast with the Stroop task , we only observed n = 3 conflict-selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Reading task ( out of 469 electrodes ) , a number that is within the false positive rate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 011 To account for within-subject and across-subject variation , we used a multilevel model ( Aarts et al . , 2014 ) to conduct a group analysis of the physiological responses , with electrodes nested within subjects ( Materials and methods ) . Across the population , we observed a significant interaction between the factors congruency and task on the gamma power ( χ2=9 . 2 , P = 0 . 002 ) . Consistent with the single electrode examples , gamma power was greater for incongruent compared to congruent trials , but only during the Stroop task ( Figure 4A , Stroop: P < 10–3 , Reading: P = 0 . 56 ) . We computed the average response in each region ( Figure 4B ) . Each electrode’s response was normalized by dividing the power during incongruent trials by the power in congruent trials ( dividing the brown curve by the black curve in Figure 2 ) , computing the logarithm and finally pooling within each region . The pooled responses in the OFC are visually less compelling ( Figure 4B , bottom right subplot ) due to the heterogeneity in the latency of the individual electrodes but the responses in the OFC were as vigorous as the ones in other areas ( e . g . Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Similar conclusions were reached when plotting the pooled responses aligned to stimulus onset ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 012Figure 4 . Gamma power in frontal cortex correlates with behavior . ( A ) Distribution of gamma power log-ratio ( Incongruent/Congruent ) for the Stroop task ( blue ) and Reading task ( green ) . Bin size = 0 . 05 . Gamma power showed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task ( P = 0 . 002 , multilevel model , Materials and methods ) .

The statistical analyses directly compare the gamma power , we show the log-ratios here for display purposes only . ( B ) Normalized gamma power log-ratio averaged across electrodes from each of the four different frontal cortex regions during the Stroop task . We divided the power during incongruent trials by the power during congruent trials , then computed the log and finally averaged across electrodes .

( C ) Distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients between the maximal gamma power and behavioral reaction time during incongruent trials for n = 51 frontal cortex electrodes . These correlations were significantly positive ( P < 10–5 , sign-rank test ) . Bin size = 0 . 1 . ( D ) For incongruent trials , there was a significant interaction between trial history and task ( P = 0 . 03 , multilevel model ) . Gamma power was larger for incongruent trials preceded by congruent trials ( cI ) compared to incongruent trials preceded by incongruent trials ( iI ) , particularly during the Stroop task ( blue , P = 0 . 001 ) , compared to the Reading task ( green , P = 0 . 72 ) . Data beyond the range of the x-axis are shown in the first or last bins . ( E ) For congruent trials , there was no interaction between trial history and task ( P = 0 . 17 , multilevel model ) . Gamma power was similar in congruent trials preceded by incongruent trials ( iC ) compared to congruent trials preceded by congruent trials ( cC ) during the Stroop task ( blue , P = 0 . 16 ) and during the Reading task ( green , P = 0 . 19 ) .

Cross-frequency coupling analyses . For the anterior cingulate cortex electrode in Figure 2: ( A ) Phase-amplitude distribution during the Stroop task for the example electrode shown in Figure 2 ( see Materials and methods for calculation of cross-frequency coupling ) . ( B ) The observed Modulation Index ( MI , black arrow ) is significantly greater than the surrogate distribution generated by adding a lag between the phase and amplitude measurements , demonstrating that the amplitude of the gamma band is strongly coupled to the phase of the theta band . ( C ) During the Stroop task , the difference in Modulation Index between congruent and incongruent trials ( black arrow ) was not significantly different from 0 ( P = 0 . 61 ) . The null distribution ( gray bars ) was generated by randomly permuting the congruent and incongruent labels .

For this comparison , the number of congruent and incongruent trials was equalized before computing the MI .

Same as in Figure 4B , but data are aligned to the stimulus response onset ( t=0 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 016 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a link between the neural signals described in the previous section and cognitive control: the neural signals correlated with reaction times , showed behavioral adaptation , and demonstrated error monitoring . As shown in previous studies , there was a wide distribution of behavioral reaction times ( Figure 1B ) . Consistent with the example electrode in Figure 2 , behavioral reaction times across the population correlated with the strength of the physiological signals , even after controlling for trial history ( Figure 4C , P < 10–5 , sign-rank test ) . The strength of these neural signals also revealed a neural correlate of the behavioral Gratton effect documented in Figure 1D: gamma power was greater in cI compared to iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . Using the aforementioned multilevel model , we found a significant interaction between trial history ( cI or iI ) and task ( χ2=4 . 4 , P = 0 . 03 ) . This Gratton effect was stronger in the Stroop task ( P < 0 . 001 ) than in the Reading task ( P = 0 . 72 ) . These differences were not observed for cC versus iC trials , where the interaction was not significant ( χ2=1 . 9 , P = 0 . 17 ) ( Figure 4E ) . This analysis was performed after removing stimulus repetition trials . The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions ( F = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 86 , ANOVA ) . To control for reaction time effects on these comparisons , we ran an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) to test for a main effect of trial history on the gamma power with the behavioral reaction time as a covariate ( Materials and methods ) . The neural Gratton effect during the Stroop task persisted under these controlled conditions ( P = 0 . 0002 , multilevel model ) . We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions , with similar results ( P = 0 . 01 , multilevel model ) . Together , these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times . The results presented above focus on the neural signals filtered within the gamma frequency band ( 70–120 Hz ) . We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals ( 1 to 100 Hz ) as well as in the theta , ( 4 to 8 Hz ) , beta , ( 9 to 30 Hz ) , and low gamma ( 30–70 Hz ) bands . No conflict selective responses were observed in the broadband signals or low gamma band . We found conflict-selective responses both in the theta and beta bands ( see example in Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–f ) . Across theta and beta frequency bands , we also observed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task ( theta: P < 10–5 , beta: P < 10–4 , multilevel model ) . Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band , conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast to the results in the gamma band , power in the theta and beta bands decreased during incongruent trials . Furthermore , power in the theta and beta frequency bands was not correlated with reaction times ( theta: P = 0 . 43 , beta: P = 0 . 09 , sign-rank test ) . In addition to separately examining the responses in different frequency bands , an important aspect of encoding of cognitive information is the relationship between signals across frequencies . In particular , several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band ( Canolty et al . , 2006; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Tort et al . , 2008 ) . We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Consistent with previous studies , we found that 50% of the electrodes demonstrated significant theta-gamma coupling . However , the strength of this coupling was not different between congruent and incongruent trials across the population of conflict-selective electrodes ( P = 0 . 52 , sign-rank test ) . The conflict responses reported above are based on correct trials only . Yet , error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits ( Bonini et al . , 2014; Shenhav et al . , 2013; Yeung et al . , 2004 ) . To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring , we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials . In these trials , subjects initially made an erroneous response and rapidly corrected themselves with the right answer . Given the high performance level of all subjects , the number of such trials is low . However , these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection ( as opposed to error trials without any self-correction ) . An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in Figure 5A . The subject initially made an incorrect response ( green ) , which was rapidly followed with the correct response ( red ) . Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response . In contrast , the following corrected behavioral response exhibited no such post-response signal . Additionally , these error-monitoring signals were not observed in correct incongruent trials ( Figure 2D ) , and were consistent across the n = 11 self-corrected trials for this subject ( Figure 5B , P = 0 . 001 , signed rank test ) . Another example electrode is shown in Figure 5C–D . There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials ( greater than five trials ) for this analysis . For each electrode , we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction . Of those n = 7 electrodes , n = 5 electrodes showed evidence of error monitoring ( Figure 5E , P < 0 . 05 , sign-rank test ) . Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small , these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals . Furthermore , these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 017Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 018 We observed conflict-selective responses in the anterior cingulate cortex , medial frontal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex . To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs , we compared , across those four regional groups , the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated . Comparing latencies across regions is difficult , especially across subjects with varying reaction times . For a controlled and direct comparison , we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas ( Figure 6 ) . The relative latencies were significantly different across the regions ( P = 0 . 01 , permutation test , post-hoc testing was controlled for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure , Materials and methods ) . Conflict responses in the ACC preceded those in all the other frontal lobe regions , followed 207 ± 40 ms later by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 388 ± 83 ms later by medial frontal cortex . Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 ± 78 ms after dlPFC . This entire processing cascade took approximately 500 ms . For comparison , subjects’ behavioral reaction times to incongruent trials were 1105 ± 49 ms . The latency difference between ACC and dlPFC is based on 6 electrode pairs: one ACC electrode and six simultaneously recorded dlPFC electrodes . There was only one pair of simultaneous recordings between ACC and OFC and we do not report this value in Figure 6 . The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects ( Supplementary file 3 ) . These results suggest a temporal hierarchy of cognitive control mechanisms culminating in speech onset . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 019Figure 6 . Latency Comparisons across regions . Latency differences between different regions computed from all pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . np denotes the number of electrode pairs . Because we only consider simultaneously recorded electrodes here , not all the electrodes modulated by conflict can be paired with any other electrode . Supplementary file 3 shows the number of electrodes modulated by conflict in each area and subject . There was only one electrode pair between ACC and OFC and therefore we do not show the latency difference between these two regions here . Significant latency differences ( P < 0 . 05 , permutation test , Materials and methods ) are shown in black , and non-significant differences in gray . ACC leads both mFC ( P = 0 . 001 ) and dlPFC ( P = 0 . 02 ) , with OFC following dlPFC ( P = 0 . 009 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 020\nWe used intracranial field potentials to measure the dynamics of conflict responses across frontal cortex leading up to the behavioral response in the Stroop task . Previous physiological and functional neuroimaging studies have documented the involvement of multiple of these frontal cortex areas in the Stroop or similar tasks ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kolling et al . , 2012; MacDonald , 2000; Niendam et al . , 2012; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The intracranial field potential recordings reported here show conflict-selective signals in ACC ( e . g . Figure 2 ) , dlPFC ( e . g . Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , mFC ( e . g . Figure 4B ) and OFC ( e . g . Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . The mFC and dlPFC have been previously implicated in cognitive control , and these structures are extensively connected to the rest of frontal cortex areas ( Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . The role of the OFC in cognitive control during Stroop-like tasks has not been reported previously , possibly because of technical challenges in neuroimaging near this area ( Weiskopf et al . , 2006 ) . We presented several lines of evidence that demonstrate that these conflict-selective physiological signals are relevant for behavior during the Stroop task . Longer behavioral reaction times were correlated with greater gamma power on a trial-by-trial basis during the Stroop task but not during the Reading task , even after accounting for trial history and for differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli ( Figure 2H , 4C ) . The same identical stimuli can elicit a range of behavioral reaction times and this internal degree of conflict can be captured , at least partly , by the strength of gamma power in frontal cortex in each trial . The neural correlates of behavioral adaptation ( Gratton effect [Gratton et al . , 1992] ) were observed in the ACC , consistent with prior studies based on human single neuron recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) , neuroimaging ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006 ) and also in accordance with the behavioral effects of ACC resection ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect , suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized . The physiological responses in these areas were stronger in cI trials ( incongruent trials that were preceded by congruent trials ) than iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies ( Botvinick et al . , 1999 ) , single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship ( iI > cI ) ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . These differences point to potentially interesting distinctions between the activity of individual neurons and coarser population measures that warrant further investigation . Another discrepancy between neuroimaging studies and single unit recordings is the presence of conflict responses and error signals . Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses ( Cole et al . , 2009; Emeric et al . , 2010; Ito et al . , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2006 ) , see however ( Ebitz and Platt , 2015 ) , whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC . There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes ( Carter et al . , 1998; Carter et al . , 2000; Nee et al . , 2011; Swick and Turken , 2002 ) . Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials , high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations . A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) , and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The current work demonstrates the coexistence of both error signals and conflict signals . The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals ( Figure 5 ) . In addition , the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict ( Yeung et al . , 2004 ) and scalp EEG studies ( Hughes and Yeung , 2011 ) . These results are consistent with computational models suggesting that these signals may represent a general error-likelihood prediction , of which conflict and error detection are special cases ( Brown and Braver , 2005 ) . It has been suggested that ACC and supplementary eye field neurons in macaque monkeys respond to specific stimulus and/or behavioral combinations but are not directly modulated by conflict ( Cole et al . , 2009; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) . At the level of the intracranial field potentials reported here , the modulation of conflict trials observed in the four frontal cortex regions could not be ascribed to specific stimulus or behavioral responses ( e . g . Figure 2G ) and were also task dependent ( compare Figure 2A versus 2C ) . In these patients , we did not have access to single neuron responses and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons show distinct patterns of responses that are averaged out at the field potential level . Besides the high gamma band , we also observed conflict responses in the beta and theta bands , but not the low gamma band ( e . g . Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Previous work has suggested differential roles for distinct oscillatory components of the local field potential ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Kahana et al . , 2001; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) . There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components . Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior . Additionally , conflict responses were characterized by increased power in the gamma band , but decreased power in the theta and beta bands ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Previous scalp EEG recordings ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; van Driel et al . , 2015 ) have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power , suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales . We also observed a decrease in beta power , which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands ( Crone et al . , 1998a; Crone et al . , 1998b ) . Differences across tasks , recording methods , and targeted regions should be interpreted with caution . The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood . One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population ( Logothetis et al . , 2001; Mitzdorf , 1987 ) and can act as channels for communication ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014 ) , whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate ( Buzsaki et al . , 2012; Ray and Maunsell , 2011 ) . Along these lines , we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs , leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response . While we observed conflict responses throughout frontal cortex , the spatiotemporal resolution of our intracranial recordings allowed us to separate regions by the latency at which conflict-selective responses emerge with respect to speech onset . By comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes , we found that conflict responses in the ACC lead the dlPFC by ~200 ms . Medial frontal cortex is anatomically close and extensively connected to the ACC , and the two regions are often grouped together ( Cavanagh et al . , 2009; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . Yet , conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds , suggesting an important distinction between the two regions ( Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade . The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control ( e . g . see Figure 2 in Shenhav et al , Neuron 2013 ) . In particular , stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex , where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions , followed by dlPFC , and finally mFC , and OFC . Since the local field potential pools over many neurons , latency measures can be influenced by a variety of factors , such as the proportion of neurons selective for conflict and their laminar organization . Yet , at least in the ACC , the temporal profile of conflict responses we observed is similar to responses from human single unit recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The relatively long delays between regions are also particularly intriguing . There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet , it takes 100–200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas ( Figure 6 ) . Daily decisions require integration of different goals , contexts , input signals , and the consequences of the resulting actions . The current study provides initial steps to elucidate not only which brain areas participate in cognitive control on a trial-by-trial basis but also their relative interactions and differential roles . The relative latency measurements and correlations between neural activity and reaction time provide a framework to constrain theories of cognitive control , and propose a plausible flow of conflict responses through frontal cortex .\nSubjects were 15 patients ( 10 male , Ages 10–50 , Supplementary file 1 ) with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy treated at Children’s Hospital Boston ( CHB ) , Johns Hopkins Medical Institution ( JHMI ) , Brigham and Women’s Hospital ( BWH ) , or Taipei Veterans General Hospital ( TVGH ) . These subjects were implanted with intracranial electrodes in frontal cortex for clinical purposes . Five other subjects participated in this task but they were excluded from the analyses because they did not have any electrodes in frontal cortex . All studies were approved by each hospital’s institutional review boards and were carried out with the subjects’ informed consent . Subjects were implanted with 2 mm diameter intracranial subdural electrodes ( Ad-Tech , Racine , WI , USA ) that were arranged into grids or strips with 1 cm separation . Electrode locations were determined by clinical considerations . There were 1397 electrodes ( 15 subjects ) . Sampling rates ranged from 256 Hz to 1000 Hz depending on the equipment at each institution: CHB ( XLTEK , Oakville , ON , Canada ) , BWH ( Bio-Logic , Knoxville , TN , USA ) , JHMI ( Nihon Kohden , Tokyo , Japan ) , and TVGH ( Natus , San Carlos , CA ) . All the data were collected during periods without any seizure events or immediately following any seizures . A schematic of the task is shown in Figure 1 . After 500 ms of fixation , subjects were presented with a word stimulus for 2 s . The stimulus presentation was 3 s in two subjects . Stimuli were one of three words ( Red , Blue , Green ) presented in the subjects’ primary language ( CHB , BWH , JHMI: English; TVGH: Mandarin ) either in red , blue , or green font color . Stimuli subtended approximately 5 degrees of visual angle and were centered on the screen . Trials were either congruent ( C ) , where the font color matched the word , or incongruent ( I ) , where the font color conflicted with the word . The order of congruent and incongruent trials was randomized . Approximately 40% of the trials were incongruent trials . Within congruent trials and within incongruent trials all color-word combinations were counter balanced and randomly interleaved . Subjects were asked to either name the color ( Stroop task ) or read the word ( Reading task ) within the time limit imposed by the stimulus presentation time . Each block contained 18 trials , and the two tasks were completed in separate blocks . Most subjects completed 18 blocks of the Stroop task and 9 blocks of the Reading task ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Audio was recorded using a microphone at 8192 Hz sampling rate . No correct/incorrect feedback was provided . Electrodes were localized by co-registering the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) with the postoperative computer tomography ( CT ) ( Destrieux et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . In 4 subjects without a postoperative CT , electrodes were localized using intraoperative photographs and preoperative MRI . For each subject , the brain surface was reconstructed from the MRI and then assigned to one of 75 regions by Freesurfer . Depth electrodes were assigned to either a subcortical structure or to gyri/sulci . We focused on those electrodes in four frontal cortex regions ( ACC: anterior and middle-anterior cingulate gyrus , mFC: superior frontal gyrus , dlPFC: middle frontal gyrus , and OFC: orbitofrontal gyrus ) . To determine the behavioral reaction time for each trial , the short-time energy was computed from the audio recordings . For an audio signal x ( t ) , the short-time energy E ( t ) is defined as: E ( t ) =∑m=0m=T[x ( m ) w ( t−m ) ]2 , where T is the length of the recording and w ( t ) is a 300-point Hamming window ( ~40 ms ) . Speech onset was defined as the first time when the energy crossed a threshold set as 1 standard deviation above the baseline . Only trials where the subject gave a single verbal response and the speech onset could be identified were considered correct trials . Unless otherwise noted , analyses in this manuscript used correct trials only . Electrodes with significant spectral noise were excluded from analysis ( n = 25 out of 1397 total electrodes ) . For each electrode , a notch filter was applied at 60 Hz , and the common average reference computed from all channels was subtracted . Power in the theta ( 4–8 Hz ) , beta ( 9–30 Hz ) , and high-gamma band ( 70–120 Hz ) was extracted using a moving window multi-taper Fourier transform ( Chronux toolbox [Mitra and Bokil , 2008] ) with a time-bandwidth product of five and seven tapers . The window size was 200 ms with 10 ms increments . In several figures , the gamma power was z-scored for display purposes ( see figure legends ) . To determine whether and when an electrode responded selectively to conflict , we used a sliding F-statistic procedure ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Electrodes with differential responses between congruent and incongruent trials were selected by computing the F-statistic , for each time bin , comparing the neural responses between congruent and incongruent trials . Electrodes were denoted as ‘conflict selective’ if ( 1 ) the F-statistic exceeded a significance threshold for 50 consecutive milliseconds , and ( 2 ) the average neural response exceeded one standard deviation above the baseline period at least once during the trial . A null distribution generated by randomly permuting the labels was used to set the significance threshold with P = 0 . 001 . The latency at which congruent and incongruent stimuli could be discriminated was defined as the first time of this threshold crossing . For the response-aligned view , only electrodes where the latency preceded the response were included in subsequent analysis . This selection process was independently performed for each electrode in both stimulus-aligned and response-aligned analyses , and separately for the Stroop and Reading task . We used a permutation test with 10 , 000 shuffles to obtain a false discovery rate for our selection process . The congruent/incongruent trial labels were randomized 10 , 000 times and we measured the average number of electrodes across our population that passed the selection procedure . For the selected electrodes obtained with the procedure described in the previous section , we performed a number of within-electrode analyses . We measured single-trial correlations with behavioral reaction times , assessed the significance of interactions and simple/main effects , and controlled for confounds in measuring the neural Gratton effect . To account for both within-subject and across-subject variance , statistical testing of the electrophysiological data was conducted with multilevel models ( Aarts et al . , 2014; Goldstein , 2011 ) ( also known as random effect models ) . Random factors included electrodes nested within subjects . Significance of interactions and/or main effects was assessed with a likelihood ratio test against a null model excluding that particular term . For comparison of latency across regions , we restricted our analyses to simultaneous measurements made within each subject . We computed the latency difference for each pair of simultaneously recorded electrodes from different regions . The F-statistic of this latency difference across the groups was compared against a null distribution generated by shuffling , within each subject , the region labels ( n = 10 , 000 shuffles ) . Post hoc testing used the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple comparisons . To measure cross-frequency coupling between the theta and gamma frequency bands , we used the Modulation Index ( MI ) defined previously ( Tort et al . , 2008 ) . Activity in the theta ( 4–8 Hz ) and high gamma ( 70–120 Hz ) bands was obtained with a zero-phase least-squares finite impulse response ( FIR ) filter . Instantaneous phase and amplitude was extracted with the Hilbert Transform . For the Stroop and Reading Task separately , the MI was computed as the Kullback-Leiber distance between the phase-amplitude histogram and a uniform distribution . For comparison between tasks , the number of trials was equalized . This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions . Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al . ( Canolty et al . , 2006 ) . Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials . To compare the strength of cross-frequency coupling between congruent and incongruent conditions , we computed the difference in MI between the two conditions while equalizing the trial count . This difference was compared against a null distribution generated by randomly shuffling the congruent and incongruent labels .",
         "The brain adapts to control our behavior in different ways depending on the specific situation , which is particularly useful when deciding how to interpret conflicting sets of information . The 'Stroop task' is a classic demonstration of this process . In this task , individuals are shown words where the color and the meaning of the text conflict – for example , the word 'green' is written in blue . When asked what the color of the text is , individuals must suppress the instinct to read the word . This causes them to make more mistakes and take longer to decide on an answer than when they perform the same task using words that have no conflict ( for example , when “red” is written in red ) . Previous work has suggested that several regions within part of the brain called the frontal cortex play a role in this cognitive control process . However , the relative contributions of each of these regions , and the order in which they are activated , remain unclear . This is in part due to the fact that accurately measuring the electrical activity of the frontal cortex requires implanting electrodes into the brain . Tang et al . took advantage of a rare opportunity to record this activity from a group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their frontal cortex to treat epilepsy . The electrical signals recorded by these electrodes as the subjects performed the Stroop task revealed that four regions in the frontal cortex altered their activity during trials where the color and the meaning of a word conflicted . These responses corresponded with the subject’s reaction time , changed depending on the exact nature of the task , and even reflected the subjects’ errors . These responses arose at different times in different regions , allowing Tang et al . to suggest how signals flow through the frontal cortex during cognitive control . In the future it will be important to further understand how the regions of the frontal cortex identified by Tang et al . interact with each other and to establish their roles in cognitive control . These observations could then be used to produce a theoretical framework that describes how the brain adapts behavior to different circumstances .",

         "Myosin 5a is a dual-headed molecular motor that transports cargo along actin filaments . By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step . Improving the spatial precision to the sub-nm regime provided evidence for an ångstrom-level structural transition in the motor domain associated with the power stroke . Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern . These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head–head coordination , the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps .\nMyosin 5a moves in a hand-over-hand fashion with individual heads moving by 74 nm and the center of mass by 37 nm for each step ( Vale , 2003; Sellers and Veigel , 2006; Hammer and Sellers , 2012 ) . A finely tuned kinetic sequence of ATP binding , hydrolysis , phosphate release and eventually ADP release by the enzymatic heads enables processive motion towards the ‘+’ end of actin filaments ( De La Cruz et al . , 1999; De La Cruz and Ostap , 2004; Rosenfeld and Sweeney , 2004; Sakamoto et al . , 2008; Forgacs et al . , 2008 ) . One of the most remarkable aspects of myosin 5a is the efficient conversion of chemical energy by the molecular-sized enzymatic heads into a translation of 74 nm along a 7 nm diameter actin filament in the presence of Brownian motion and a crowded cellular environment . Crystal structures of myosin 5a exist either with or without nucleotide , but only in the detached state ( Coureux et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . Although these structures served as a model for the structural changes potentially induced by binding to actin , ( Volkmann et al . , 2005 ) the internally coupled rearrangement of the subdomains leading to ADP and phosphate release or dissociation from actin upon ATP binding could only be studied in silico ( Cecchini et al . , 2008 , 2010; Sweeney and Houdusse , 2010; Preller and Holmes , 2013 ) . The experimental challenge in revealing such structural dynamics has been largely of spatiotemporal origin , since they are likely on the Ångstrom scale and may be very transient . Similarly , there has been considerable interest in directly revealing the motion of the individual heads as myosin steps along actin in an attempt to unravel the origins of efficient motion on the nanoscale . Single molecule studies employing optical trapping ( Mehta et al . , 1999; Rief et al . , 2000 ) and fluorescence imaging ( Forkey et al . , 2003; Yildiz et al . , 2003; Snyder et al . , 2004; Warshaw et al . , 2005 ) have either reported periods of increased flexibility , ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) or partitioning of the step into sub-events ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Uemura et al . , 2004; Cappello et al . , 2007; Sellers and Veigel , 2010 ) . All resulting models involve a forward aiming power stroke followed by a Brownian search mechanism ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Okada et al . , 2007; Shiroguchi and Kinosita , 2007; Karagiannis et al . , 2014 ) . The power stroke of the attached head contributes only partially to the step by moving the pivot point that facilitates Brownian rotation of the unbound head . The bias towards the next binding site is believed to be provided by the recovery stroke and its stability , but how unidirectional stepping is achieved in the presence of such a large and mostly random motion remains unclear ( Shiroguchi et al . , 2011 ) . The first passage time of the translocating head is expected to be on the order of 100 µs , ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Hinczewski et al . , 2013 ) although the head spends tens of ms in the unbound state given the maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis and binding to actin ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) . Any technique aiming to visualize the structural dynamics of the motor domain or the motion of the unattached head would thus have to achieve simultaneous millisecond temporal and nanometer spatial precision . Optical trapping operates in this spatiotemporal regime , but it is not possible to monitor the motion of the unattached head without significant perturbation . Smaller labels affixed to the myosin motor domain or to calmodulin molecules on the lever arm , as available in fluorescence imaging , do not suffer from this limitation , but cannot provide sufficient localization precision on the millisecond time scale . We therefore designed an assay based on interferometric scattering microscopy ( iSCAT ) , ( Kukura et al . , 2009; Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura , 2012 ) a technique that has recently been shown to enable simultaneous high-speed and high-precision imaging of 20 nm diameter or smaller nanoscale scattering labels ( Andrecka et al . , 2013; Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) .\nWe attached a 20 nm gold label functioning as an efficient light scatterer to the N-terminus of the myosin 5 head and tracked its motion as the motor travels along actin filaments ( Figure 1A , inset ) . From the centre of mass of the signal produced by the label , we determined the position of the head as a function of time revealing discrete 74 nm steps at 1000 frames/s imaging speed with ∼4 nm positional precision ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , Video 1 ) . We verified that the addition of the 20 nm label did not interfere with the mechano–chemical cycle of myosin 5a by characterizing the speed of movement at different ATP concentrations . Our results compare well with those from a series of other single molecule studies where the molecule was labeled on the lever arm , the tail , or attached to a surface ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 003Figure 1 .

This file contains the iSCAT video from which the trajectory shown in Figure 1 of the main manuscript was obtained . The left panel presents the raw video format after referencing with the flat field image . The flat field accounts for illumination inhomogeneities and was generated as described in the Materials and Methods section . The right panel shows the static background subtracted video format . The background includes the average of 100 frames before the particle binds and removes the constant features which are part of the sample ( a . g . actin , glass roughness ) by simple subtraction ( Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . The video was taken at 1000 frames/s and at a magnification of 31 . 8 nm/pixel . The corresponding field of view shown is 1 . 30 × 1 . 30 μm2 and corresponds to a total recording time of 1 . 3 s . The video playback speed is 1000 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 007 In addition to the expected 74 nm steps , we observed periods of increased positional fluctuations between detachment and reattachment of the labeled head , previously interpreted as a signature of Brownian search ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . Our effective lateral localization precision of 4 nm at 1000 frames/s , however , enabled us to visualize the motion of the unbound head precisely and revealed a transient state with a center of mass just over half way between the two binding sites and offset by 40 nm perpendicular to the actin filament ( Figure 1B ) . From this position , the myosin head repeatedly moved back and forth between the next actin binding site and the transient state position ( Figure 1C , D ) . The same behavior sometimes occurred just before myosin detached from the filament at the end of a trajectory ( Figure 1E ) , although detachment of myosin with the labeled head bound was equally likely . On the rare occasions that the labelled leading head of myosin detached and reattached , it occupied a similar position in space to a translocating head ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) , suggesting that the transient state represents a true potential minimum of the one head bound state of myosin . In addition to providing nanometer precise information on the lateral position of the head through the center of mass of the signal , the iSCAT signal magnitude is very sensitive to the label-to-surface distance allowing for overall nanometric localization in three-dimensions ( Krishnan et al . , 2010 ) . This property arises from the interferometric nature of the technique , which scales the iSCAT signal as sinΦ , where Φ is the phase difference between scattered and reflected light fields . As the label moves perpendicular to the sample plane , the optical path length and with it the phase difference between the two fields changes by the following relation Φ = 4πηz/λ ( Figure 2A , inset ) . A complete signal inversion occurs for a displacement of z = λ/4η = 84 nm , where λ is the illumination wavelength ( 445 nm ) and η the refractive index of the medium ( 1 . 33 ) . Thus , variations in the axial distance of the motor domain with respect to the filament bound to the sample surface lead to changes in the scattering contrast . We often observed these changes in contrast between the actin bound and unbound states ( Figure 2A ) and obtained an average change in iSCAT signal during the step ( Figure 2B ) . The drop of 3 . 5% in iSCAT contrast ( ∼40% of the total signal ) suggests that the myosin head lifts on average by 24 ± 10 nm from its actin bound position . Although the precision of the measurement was in principle higher , we could not accurately determine the additional phase contributions to the interferometric signal on an individual label basis , which are required for a robust calibration . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 008Figure 2 .

The red subset of the traces corresponds to the unbound head state . Inset: schematic illustrating how the difference in optical path difference for the bound ( zbound ) and unbound ( zunbound ) state leads to changes in iSCAT contrast caused by the interference of the reflected ( Ereflected ) and scattered ( Escattered ) electric fields .

( A ) 2D-trajectory of myosin 5 stepping along actin recorded simultaneously with 445 nm ( blue trace ) and 635 nm ( red trace ) illumination . Although the latter channel exhibits higher noise due to a lower scattering signal , the transient state is evident in every step even though much of the data are lost in the trace recorded at 445 nm due to the major drop in scattering intensity .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 009 We occasionally encountered tracks where the transient state could not be localized because the iSCAT contrast dropped to zero . We interpret these cases as corresponding to molecules oriented parallel to the glass surface based on simultaneous iSCAT measurements using blue ( 445 nm ) and red ( 635 nm ) illumination . The particle remained visible in the red channel while it disappeared in the blue . At the same time , the off-axis component of the transient state was much smaller compared to those trajectories when the transient state remained visible in both channels , which is most consistent with a parallel bound molecule lifting the detached head up by ∼40 nm ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . To investigate whether subsequent steps occur on the same or opposite sides of the actin filament , commonly referred to as symmetric and asymmetric hand-over-hand stepping , ( Hua et al . , 2002 ) we labeled the two heads of a single molecule differently , one with a quantum dot and the other with a 20 nm gold particle ( Figure 3 , top ) . Simultaneous detection of quantum dot fluorescence and iSCAT signal was only possible with a longer wavelength scattering beam which is only weakly absorbed by the quantum dot , thereby avoiding excessive blinking and bleaching ( 660 vs 445 nm ) . In addition , the imaging speed was lowered to 500 frames/s to ensure <10 nm localization precision in the fluorescence channel while imaging over several seconds . We tracked both the scattering from the gold particle of one head ( upper traces in Figure 3 ) and the fluorescence of the quantum dot-labeled head ( lower traces in Figure 3 ) . In all recorded trajectories of doubly-labeled molecules that exhibited clear transient states in both the fluorescence and scattering channels , the transient states for both heads appeared on the same side of the actin filament ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 011 Close inspection of the time traces occasionally revealed what appeared to be small backwards movements of the attached head , such as the transition starting at 480 ms in the trace of Figure 1A . Since our localisation precision at 1000 frames/s is limited by the intrinsic motion of the label about its attachment point to the motor domain and diffusion of background scatterers , we repeated the tracking assay at 100 frames/s . At this imaging speed , we could frequently observe a transition between two distinct states during each 74 nm step in both an x–y projection ( Figure 4A ) and the time trace ( Figure 4B ) . As shown in the lateral trajectory , the transition between these states ( AB transition ) involves a small , <10 nm , off-axis backward motion of the gold particle attached to the bound head . As a result , the overall step size appears larger than the expected 74 nm step ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 014 The positional fluctuations ( σ = 0 . 91 nm SD ) of a surface-attached label recorded in the same field of view as the trajectory suggest that we achieved sub-nm lateral localization precision of 20 nm gold at 100 frames/s ( Figure 4B , blue ) . The localization noise increased for a gold bead attached to an actin-bound myosin ( σ = 1 . 6 ± 0 . 3 nm in Figure 4B ) , but remained small enough such that transitions on the order of 5 nm were clearly visible ( Figure 4A–B ) . The slightly larger positional fluctuations for gold bound to the actomyosin complex compared to immobilized gold were likely caused by a combination of a flexible protein-label connection and a limited ability in to completely immobilize actin . We observed a clear drop in the iSCAT contrast when the labeled trailing head detached and transitioned to the leading position ( Figure 4C ) . We also measured a much smaller change in iSCAT contrast during the AB transition , likely due to a three-dimensional reorientation of the label . We then performed simultaneous tracking of the head and the tail of myosin 5a , which showed that the small backwards transition corresponds to the power stroke of the bound motor domain . To achieve this , we labeled the myosin head with a 20 nm gold particle as previously and the tail with a GFP booster ( Ries et al . , 2012 ) . We reduced our frame rate to 20 frames/s in order to increase the fluorescence signal from the tail , since single molecule fluorescence tracking of GFP with <5 nm precision at 100 frames/s is challenging . The resulting traces showed that both the large-scale translocation of the head and the subsequent smaller backwards transition coincide with translation of the tail ( Figure 5A ) . This implies that the small-scale transition accompanies the power stroke of the attached labeled head ( AB transition ) and is representative of a pre- to post-power stroke transition ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 015Figure 5 . Simultaneous iSCAT and fluorescence tracking of myosin 5a . ( A ) Tracking of the scattering signal from the gold nanoparticle attached to the N-terminus ( black ) and fluorescence signal from the GFP moiety located at the C-terminus of the same myosin 5a molecule ( green ) . Movement of the tail correlates with the labeled head taking its step ( 74 nm displacement ) and with the AB transition ( power stroke of the labeled head ) . Green arrows represent the tail movement , which corresponds to the step of either the labelled or unlabeled head . When the unlabeled head takes its step it coincides with the AB transition within the labeled head ( red arrows ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 015 To determine the structural origin of the AB transition , we repeated the tracking experiments with differently sized labels . We found that the average size of the AB transition increased from 7 . 4 ± 3 . 2 nm to 9 . 5 ± 3 . 1 nm and 11 . 5 ± 2 . 5 nm for 20 , 30 and 40 nm diameter labels , respectively ( Figure 6A ) . This suggests that the AB transition reports on a conformational change of the bound head , which is a rotation of the N-terminal domain , rather than a translation of the head itself along actin . The consequences of a rotational movement of the label are presented schematically in Figure 6B . The red circles indicate the positions of two labels in the pre-power stroke A state ( with radii r1 and r2 , where r2 = 2 × r1 ) . The grey circles correspond to the post-power stroke B state . Red and grey dots indicate their respective centers . For a larger label ( r2 ) , the same movement of the N-terminus leads to an overall similar motion but with a larger displacement of the center of mass ( d2 ) than for a small label ( d1 ) . Using this model and our data , we could extract an angle of rotation , α , as well as a distance , x , that defines the origin of rotation , since sin ( α/2 ) = ½ d1/ ( r1 + x ) and d2/d1 = ( r2 + x ) / ( r1 + x ) . Using the hydrodynamic radii for the labels obtained by dynamic light scattering ( 20 , 26 and 32 nm ) , we obtained α = 20° for the angle and x = 1 . 7 nm . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 016Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 016 Trajectories recorded at 100 frames/s frequently showed both the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition , revealing that they were invariably in line ( Figure 7A , B ) . During the recording of 351 traces that exhibited clear signatures of the transient state at 100 frames/s , we found a preference ( 66% vs 33% ) of right over left-handed walking . Within individual traces , we only observed the transient state on the same side of actin . In some cases , however , we could observe individual myosin molecules switch from one actin filament to another . As previously , the transient state always appeared on one side while on one actin filament , but either switched to the other ( Figure 7C ) or remained on the same side ( Figure 7D ) of the actin track when the molecule moved from one filament to another . For 102 switching events , we found that the transient state remained on the same side of the filament 60% of the time , while changing sides in 40% of the events . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 017 Given that the transient state could always be clearly identified either to the right or to the left side of actin , we could align all recorded steps from the 1000 frames/s tracking data by flipping them about the actin filament when necessary to obtain a 2D spatial probability distribution maps of the location of both the unbound and bound myosin head compared to the actin binding sites during a single step ( Figure 8 ) . The resulting contour plot contained two maxima . For the transient state one was located ∼5 nm away from the final actin binding site and the other 40 nm off-axis from the actin filament . For the A and B states the bound head orientations were in line with the position of the transient state , with the lateral projection connecting the A , B and transient states approximately in a straight line ( see also Figure 7 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 018Figure 8 .

Dwell time distributions for pre and post-power stroke states at different ATP concentrations . In all cases , data and fits for the pre-power stroke state are shown in red; data and fits for the post-power stroke state are shown in blue . At saturating ( 1 mM ) ATP concentration ( A ) both dwell time distributions exhibited single exponential behaviour in line with ADP release being the rate limiting step . The constants for the A state dwell times are given by kA and that for the B state by kB . At lower ATP concentrations , sequential ADP release and ATP binding result in bi-exponential behaviour . At 10 μM ATP ( B ) , both kinetic constants , k1 , k2 , are almost identical therefore the dwell time distribution is fit to two sequential process with the same rate constant ( termed kA for the dwell time of the A state and kB for that of the B state ) . ( C ) At 1 μM ATP the process is limited by ATP binding . Data taken at 100 frames/s , we increased the imaging speed to 400 Hz at 1 mM ATP concentration .

Geometrical considerations assuming myosin molecules moving parallel to the glass surface . If the head searched the full spherical space , the average position would be simply about half way between the leading head and the next binding site . For a parallel orientation this would be 56 nm forward and 15 nm off axis and for a perpendicular orientation 56 nm forward but ‘in line’ with the bound head positions . These numbers arise from simple geometric considerations but also agree with much more sophisticated simulations based on a free rotational diffusion model ( Hinczewski et al . , 2013 ) . We , however , observed a transient state half way between the two binding sites , 40 nm off axis ( marked in orange ) , which rules out this geometry .

Contour map of a two-dimensional histogram with a 18 × 18 nm2 bin width was obtained using all , left- and right- handed walking traces , without flipping ( left panel ) . The resulting contour plot shows good agreement with previous results ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 022 Our ability to clearly distinguish between bound and unbound states during processive motion , allowed us to extract the dwell times of the transient state . We found that it followed a single exponential distribution with a lifetime of 17 . 5 ± 0 . 6 ms . We found no ATP concentration dependence on both the spatial and temporal distributions of the transient state within our experimental error ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . The corresponding dwell time distributions for the A and B states followed the behavior expected for processes limited by ATP binding and ADP release ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2 ) . In all cases , the dwell times of the A and the B states were identical suggesting that the 20 nm gold particle had no effect on the stepping kinetics .\nLabel-sizes of a few tens of nm are traditionally avoided in single particle tracking experiments to prevent the label from perturbing the dynamics of interest . By monitoring the lifetimes of the A and B states , which effectively provides the dwell times of the labeled and unlabeled heads , respectively , we demonstrate that the 20 nm gold particle attached to the N-terminus of myosin has no measureable effect on the kinetics of stepping . If detrimental effects can be excluded experimentally , as in this case , our results show that the larger size of the label can actually be advantageous in revealing structural dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible . Here , the label probes the structural change occurring in the bound head during the power stroke and amplifies it into a nanometer scale motion . Previous studies using gold labels were not able to observe this transition likely due to a combination of a different labeling strategy ( 40 nm or 60 nm gold nanoparticle attached to a calmodulin on the lever arm ) and much lower spatial precision ( >10 nm ) ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . Several EM studies ( Walker et al . , 2000; Burgess et al . , 2002; Oke et al . , 2010 ) failed to detect any obvious conformational differences in the position of the SH3 ( N-terminal domain ) of lead and trail heads , whereas we now demonstrate a movement of this domain associated with the power stroke taken after the trail head dissociates . This change is consistent with results of molecular dynamic simulations of both myosin 5a and myosin 2 based on crystal structures suggesting that the N-terminus undergoes a rotation during the power stroke transition ( Coureux et al . , 2003; Cecchini et al . , 2008; Preller and Holmes , 2013 ) . Although the original myosin 5 tracking performed with a fluorescently-labeled calmodulin bound to the lever arm at 1 . 5 nm precision revealed 74 nm steps , ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) a later study with rigidly attached dye labels on the calmodulin bound to the lever arm suggested that they in fact represent 64–10 nm steps ( Syed et al . , 2006 ) . During the acquisition of 4728 steps in 635 trajectories , we never observed a large followed by a small forward step . In our work , we labeled the motor domain directly , while in the previous studies , calmodulin bound to the lever arm was used as an attachment point . Since the lever arm moves significantly during the power stroke , attachment of the dye at this location may suggest a sub-step along actin , even though the motor domain itself does not move . Thus the term ‘sub step’ is inappropriate for this pattern of movement . In addition , the orientation of single dipoles can have a significant impact on the position obtained from standard Gaussian fitting and exacerbate even very small translocations ( Enderlein et al . , 2006 ) . A recent AFM study ( Kodera et al . , 2010 ) reported that detachment and reattachment of the leading head , a so-called ‘foot stomp’ contributes to the mechanochemical cycle of myosin 5 . Such behavior was also observed in the single molecule tracking study discussed above , ( Syed et al . , 2006 ) although the frequency of occurrence was not discussed in that work . The sensitivity of our tracking methodology to detachment from actin in three dimensions , however , shows that myosin remains firmly bound to actin with both heads during the mechanochemical cycle irrespective of whether the head is leading or trailing ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , except when the head takes a 74 nm step . Only on very rare occasions did we observe detachment of the leading head . Specifically , only ~3% of steps taken at 1 µM ATP , ~0 . 6% of steps taken at 10 µM ATP , none at saturating ATP exhibited this behavior . The unbinding event was not necessarily followed by reattachment at a different site suggesting that these events can be explained simply by the binding equilibria between myosin and actin , rather than being an active component of the stepping mechanism . One likely explanation for the increased occurrence of lead head detachment and reattachment in recent AFM studies ( Kodera et al . , 2010; Ando et al . , 2013 ) is the much lower ATP concentration used or the non-negligible interaction of the AFM tip with the protein . The combination of temporal and spatial precision achieved in this work directly reveals the motion of the unbound head of myosin during translocation . From the two head bound state of myosin 5a , the trailing head detaches from actin upon binding of ATP ( Figure 9A ) . The leading head then undergoes a power stroke that leans the protein forward , a motion that exhibits a strong torsional component ( Komori et al . , 2007; Ohmachi et al . , 2012 ) . After the power stroke , the unbound head arrives at a minimum in the potential energy from where it approaches the next actin binding site in what appears to be a one dimensional biased search . The transient state lifetime agrees with the duration of increased flexibility reported in optical trapping experiments probing the attachment stiffness at high time-resolution ( Veigel et al . , 2002 ) and single molecule tracking of the motor domain ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) . The measured lifetime also correlates well with previously reported ensemble rate constant for the weak-to-strong binding transition ( 47 s−1 ) ( Rosenfeld and Sweeney , 2004 ) . The presence of an additional high probability density very close to the final binding site further favors such an interpretation . This density very likely corresponds to the weakly bound state from which the head frequently moves back to the side position . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 023Figure 9 . Mechanism of the myosin step . ( A ) ATP binding to the trailing head ( yellow ) and its detachment releases strain stored in the molecule . ( B ) The bound head ( black with a gold nanoparticle attached ) performs its power stroke which is accompanied by the AB transition ( inset ) . The labeled head becomes a new trailing head ( C ) which detaches after ATP binding . ( D ) It moves forward in a partially twisting motion and occupies an off axis position ( transient state ) . From this position , the head binds the desired binding site while ATP hydrolyses . ( E ) The step completes as the head binds actin and is repeated by the other head in the same direction dictated by the initial torsional strain . ( F ) Schematic representation of both heads' movement ( lateral projection ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 023 An important implication of our data is that the position of the transient state , displaced 40 nm along and perpendicular to the filament is inconsistent with a purely rotational diffusion search . In that case we would require most molecules to be bound parallel to the surface and then expect the average position of the detached head to be displaced ∼56 nm along and not more than 20 nm perpendicular to the filament ( Figure 8—figure supplement 3 ) . We emphasize however , that our data does not contradict previous dark field results , which lead to the rotational diffusion model ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . We can closely reproduce such results by adding 17 nm of localization noise to our traces . At such localization precision , left- and right- handed walking is no longer distinguishable leading to a probability density map that is no longer one-sided ( Figure 8—figure supplement 4 ) . Why the unattached head occupies a positon 40 nm away from the actin filament is a priori puzzling . There is neither an intrinsic reason for the head to pause there , nor is there a binding site present at this position . Our experimental data provides no evidence that the transient state is induced or measurably affected by unwanted interactions caused by the particle or the surface as suggested by the similarity of our transient state lifetime to previous studies with alternative labeling strategies , ( Forkey et al . , 2003; Snyder et al . , 2004; Warshaw et al . , 2005 ) the presence of the transient state for much smaller labels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) , the change in contrast during the step ( Figure 2 ) , the lack of non-specific binding of our label to the surface or actin and any localizations during the one head bound state that coincide with the underlying actin track . This location and the resulting movement , however , become more intuitive when considering that the intrinsic angle between the lever arms is similar to that found when the two heads are bound to actin , that is , ∼37 nm away from each other . Comparison of electron micrographs of myosin 5 bound to actin ( Walker et al . , 2000 ) and non-specifically bound to a surface in the absence of actin ( Takagi et al . , 2014 ) show clearly peaked angle distributions around 105 and 115° , respectively , suggesting a built-in preference for such a spatial arrangement of the two heads , rather than a truly flexible linkage , another indication that a completely free swivel at the neck-linker is unlikely . In this way , keeping the angle between the lever arms roughly intact during stepping and twisting partially about the leading head causes the translocating motor domain to preferentially reach the desired binding site . As a result a full three dimensional search mechanism is minimized to one defined by a one dimensional arc . The position of the transient state together with what appears to be constrained diffusion suggests that myosin side steps along actin in a combined twisting and leaning motion , much more like a drawing compass rather than a freely jointed swivel or human-like gait . In hindsight , such a mechanism has numerous advantages over a search based on full rotational diffusion . It generates a built-in bias for finding the correct binding site and ensures that the head needs to travel and search only along one dimension to find the desired binding site defined by the torsion about the leading head and neck linker rather than a lower probability three-dimensional Brownian search . Even if the motor domain fails to bind strongly on first passage , it swings back and forth between the transient state and the desired actin site until tight binding can occur . This suggests that the structure of myosin 5a facilitates and controls the motion of the unbound head to achieve such high specificity in finding the desired binding site . Our results do not imply that the head is effectively stationary at the transient state position while in the one head bound state . Some degree of diffusional search is inherent to the system and cannot be captured even at our low exposure time of 0 . 56 ms , which is comparable to the positional autocorrelation time we measured ( 0 . 3 ms ) , and predicted theoretically ( Craig and Linke , 2009 ) . The location of the transient state , the fact that in several thousand steps we never observed a single step with transient localizations on both sides of the actin filament , and a predominantly perpendicular orientation of myosin relative to the surface caused by our surface preparation , however , suggest that diffusion is constrained . On the contrary , we believe that this constraint is a key to myosin 5's efficiency in terms of processive motion in contrast to a completely free , spherical search space . The fact that the AB transition and the relative location of the rear-binding site and the transient state are in line has two further important implications . It suggests that the AB transition cannot solely be a consequence of a steric interaction between the label and the lever arm . In that case , we should only observe one type of AB transition , irrespective of whether right or left-handed walking occurs . Furthermore , it shows a connection between the directionality of the N-terminus and lever arm movement . The observed N-terminus domain movement could thus be a signature of the release of this strain . This conformational change , critical for rearrangement of the nucleotide binding pocket and/or closure of the internal cleft , would then allow for finalizing the actomyosin energy transduction . In other words , the energy from the ATPase reaction , stored in the actomyosin complex can only be fully used after the trailing head detaches and the system can relax . Our data shows that the AB transition is associated with the power stroke but it is unlikely that the 20° rotation of the N-terminus is directly responsible for the side step per se . The fact that the transient state is either to the left or to the right of the filament implies that it cannot be a pure consequence of the attached lever arm swing . We therefore propose that the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition reflect the strain release upon rear head detachment . The initial strain is built up within the head domain and transmitted up to the lever arm during the first binding when one of the heads twists in order to bind to the same actin filament ( Liu et al . , 2006 ) . The simultaneous tracking of the movement of both heads using the combination of gold scattering and fluorescence demonstrates that myosin walks in a symmetric manner where each head movement is accompanied by an 180° swing on the same side of the actin filament , unlike a human gait . This type of movement would imply that the cargo also rotates with each step or that a swivel exists to relieve the strain that would otherwise develop between the myosin and the cargo . Such a rotation has been measured by the orientation of quantum rods attached to the myosin 5a tail , although , in this work the source of the rotational movement was thought to be thermal ( Ohmachi et al . , 2012 ) . Our observation that the orientation of the transient state relative to actin may change for the same molecule by binding to another actin filament shows that the position of the transient state relative to actin is not an intrinsic property of individual myosin molecules . Otherwise , we would expect each molecule to preserve the orientation of the transient state even when changing from one filament to another . Instead , the decision is made upon binding to actin , with both cases following the right and left hand preference previously mentioned . With respect to the source of the symmetry breaking , one possible explanation involves the steric interaction with the surface . Depending on the initial binding angle the steric interactions with the surface would determine the direction of rotation . However , if the sidedness was only a consequence of an interaction with the surface , then we would at least expect the molecules that are bound perpendicular to the glass surface and thus have the least interaction with it , to show no preference . Since we never observed transient states on both sides of the filament during individual runs , the reported mechanism is likely to be an intrinsic feature of the myosin 5a stepping . Based on our observation that the transient state for both heads occurs on the same side of the actin filament we propose that the twisting that takes place during the initial binding event of both heads to actin determines the directionality . This initial twist , possibly driven by thermal fluctuations , establishes the direction in which the initial torsional strain is built up and is then repeatedly stored and released as the protein moves along actin . Once the directionality of the transient state has been established , both heads follow the same constrained route resulting in an efficient , unidirectional motion .\nRabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and stored in liquid nitrogen until used . A 20 μM actin stock solution was prepared in polymerisation buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA [pH 7 . 3] containing 1 . 7 mM DTT , 3 mM ATP ) . Actin was diluted in motility buffer ( MB; 20 mM MOPS pH 7 . 3 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA ) 20–50 times . Mouse myosin 5a HMM with a C-terminal GFP was expressed in the presence of calmodulin and purified as described ( Wang , 2000 ) . In addition , the N-terminus was modified by the addition of a nucleotide sequence encoding an AviTag peptide ( GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE ) for site-specific biotinylation with BirA ligase ( Avidity , Aurora , Colorado ) . After biotinylation , the sample was aliquoted , flash frozen in 20 μl drops and stored at −80°C . Before labeling , the myosin sample was diluted in MB containing 40 mM KCl , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mg/ml BSA and 5 μM calmodulin . Gold nanoparticles of 20 nm , 30 nm and 40 nm in diameter conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from BBI ( UK ) and directly mixed with biotinylated myosin 5a sample in a 4:1 , gold to myosin ratio , consistent with one or zero myosin molecules per gold particle . The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 15 min ( sample volume 50 μl , final concentration of myosin 300 pM ) . The same procedure was used for double gold/Qdot labeling . The quantum dots ( emission maximum 565 ) conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from Invitrogen ( Lifetechnologies , UK ) . For fluorescence only imaging , myosin was incubated for 10 min with Atto-647 streptavidin ( Atto-TEC , Germany ) . The following oxygen scavenger system was used to increase the fluorescent dye stability: 0 . 2 mg/ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 4% wt/vol glucose , 0 . 04 mg/ml catalase , all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( UK ) . The flow cell was prepared as described ( Dunn and Spudich , 2011 ) . It was first rinsed with 1 mg/ml solution of poly ( ethylene glycol ) -poly-l-lysine ( PEG-PLL ) branch copolymer ( Surface Solutions SuSoS , Switzerland ) in PBS and incubated for 30 min . Next , it was washed twice with MB before adding the actin solution . After 5 min of incubation , the chamber was washed with MB and the surface was blocked by adding 1 mg/ml BSA in MB buffer . Finally , the chamber was inspected and myosin-gold conjugate solution containing ATP was added . All assays were performed at room temperature . Interferometric scattering microscopy was performed as detailed previously ( Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura , 2012 ) . For two-colour imaging a second diode laser ( 635 nm ) was overlapped with the 445 nm beam path with a dichroic mirror . In the detection arm , the images were separated by an identical optic before being imaged onto two separate CMOS cameras ( MV-D1024-160-CL-8 , Photonfocus , Switzerland ) at 333× magnification ( 31 . 8 nm/pixel ) . The incident power was adjusted to 17 . 9 kW/cm2 at the sample to achieve near-saturation of the CMOS camera , which ensured shot noise limited detection . Fluorescence only imaging and tracking was achieved with a home-built TIRF microscope using a 635 nm diode laser . The incident power was set to 5 kW/cm2 and the fluorescence imaged onto an Andor iXon3 860 EM-CCD camera at 72 . 1 nm/pixel with a 9 . 2 μm × 9 . 2 μm field of view using dielectric filters ( Thorlabs , Germany ) to separate illumination and emission . Sample-specific images with shot noise limited sensitivity were obtained by dividing the raw image by a reference flat field image . The flat field reference image containing non-sample specific illumination inhomogeneities , fixed pattern noise and any constant background caused by residual reflections was produced by first recording 2000 images while moving the sample stage with a piezo-driven XY translation stage . The resulting image stack was temporally averaged to 100 frames and each pixel of the flat field reference image was computed as the temporal median value of the frame sequence . Removal of sample specific constant background and thereby increase in the image signal to noise ratio was achieved by obtaining the static background from the sample by averaging at least 10 frames that lacked a signal from the processive myosin 5a molecule labeled with a gold nanoparticle of interest ( Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . Nanometric tracking of labeled myosin 5a was achieved by non-linear least square fitting of the point spread function to a two-dimensional Gaussian . Spatiotemporal characterization of the transient state was achieved by alignment of several steps and separation of the states . We segmented each trajectory into step pairs defined as the set containing the data before and after each 74 nm step . These steps were detected manually by using a time interval slider along the 2D trajectory and checking for changes in positional fluctuations . The orientation of the transient state relative to actin was determined and later used to align all steps . To determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the side step only step pair traces that showed transient states lasting longer than 10 ms were used . First , we fixed the center of mass of the beginning of the step to coordinate position ( 0 , 0 ) . Then , we applied a rotation matrix to the entire step pair trace so that both bound states lie along the horizontal axis . Finally , all aligned step pair traces were overlapped to produce the contour plots shown in Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 .",
         "Cells use motor proteins that to move organelles and other cargos from one place to another . The myosins are a family of motor proteins that pull cargo along filaments made of another protein called actin . The ‘head’ end of myosin attaches to the actin filament and the ‘tail’ end binds to the cargo . The head and tail are connected by a flexible linker that allows the protein to change shape . The tails of two myosin molecules bind together to form a two-headed motor that can move along an actin filament by taking 74 nm steps . At the start of each step , both heads are attached to the actin with one in front of the other . The leading head remains attached while the rear head detaches from actin and moves in front of the leading head reattaching to actin . These movements are repeated many times to allow the motor to move along the filament , much like a tightrope walker walking along a wire . However , it is not known how the motor can move so efficiently along the actin while managing to avoid falling off its track . Here , Andrecka et al . analyzed the movement of the myosin 5 motor in real time using a method called ‘interferometric scattering microscopy’ . The experiments show that when a head detaches from the actin , it is temporarily held out to one side of the actin filament . From here , this detached head sways back and forth , until it takes a step forward and binds firmly to the next position on the filament . Both heads follow identical paths along the actin filament , and so the movement resembles the way that a drawing or dividing compass can be used to measure distances on a map . Andrecka et al . 's findings shed new light on how myosin motors move along actin . This may become a blueprint for efficient nano-mechanical motion and could therefore be important for designing artificial machines that operate on the nanoscale .",

    "To begin processing our data to create extractive summaries we implement a method of assigning vectors to words called Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(tf-idf). This process allows us to assign a concept of importance and meaning to words in our documents represented by a number. This is done by first getting the term frequency, a count of each term in its document divided by the total number of terms in that document. Then the inverse document frequency, which is the total number of documents in our corpus divided by the number of documents containing some specific word, that value is then multiplied by log base e. We will do this for each document to produce a unique set of vector word pairs. The higher a vector, the more important that word is to that document. "

         "In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . We used geo-coded mortality data and wavelets to analyse the seasonality of mortality by age group and sex from 1980 to 2016 in the USA and its subnational climatic regions . Death rates in men and women ≥ 45 years peaked in December to February and were lowest in June to August , driven by cardiorespiratory diseases and injuries . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . Under five years , seasonality of all-cause mortality largely disappeared after the 1990s . In adolescents and young adults , especially in males , death rates peaked in June/July and were lowest in December/January , driven by injury deaths .\nIt is well-established that death rates vary throughout the year , and in temperate climates there tend to be more deaths in winter than in summer ( Campbell , 2017; Fowler et al . , 2015; Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) . It has therefore been hypothesized that a warmer world may lower winter mortality in temperate climates ( Langford and Bentham , 1995; Martens , 1998 ) . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare ( Davis et al . , 2004; Braga et al . , 2001; Kalkstein , 2013; Medina-Ramón and Schwartz , 2007 ) . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time ( Bobb et al . , 2014; Carson et al . , 2006; Seretakis et al . , 1997; Sheridan et al . , 2009 ) . A thorough understanding of the long-term dynamics of seasonality of mortality , and its geographical and demographic patterns , is needed to identify at-risk groups , plan responses at the present time as well as under changing climate conditions . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death ( Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . In this paper , we comprehensively characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality in the USA by sex and age group , through the application of wavelet analytical techniques , to over three decades of national mortality data . Wavelets have been used to study the dynamics of weather phenomena ( Moy et al . , 2002 ) and infectious diseases ( Grenfell et al . , 2001 ) . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . In addition , we identify how the percentage difference between death rates in maximum and minimum mortality months has changed over time .\nThe strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . A limitation of our study is that we did not investigate seasonality of mortality by socioeconomic characteristics which may help with understanding its determinants and planning responses .\nWe used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , we also showed that all-cause and cause-specific mortality seasonality is largely similar in terms of both timing and magnitude across diverse climatic regions with substantially different summer and winter temperatures . Insights of this kind would not have been possible analysing data averaged over time or nationally , or fixed to pre-specified frequencies . Prior studies have noted seasonality of mortality for all-cause mortality and for specific causes of death in the USA ( Feinstein , 2002; Kalkstein , 2013; Rau , 2004; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Our results on strong seasonality of cardiorespiratory diseases deaths and weak seasonality of cancer deaths , restricted to older ages , are broadly consistent with these studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966; Seretakis et al . , 1997 ) , which had limited analysis on how seasonality changes over time and geography ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies ( Feinstein , 2002; Rau et al . , 2018; Rosenwaike , 1966 ) , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . A study of 36 cities in the USA , aggregated across age groups and over time , also found that excess mortality was not associated with seasonal temperature range ( Kinney et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , a European study found that the difference between winter and summer mortality was lower in colder Nordic countries than in warmer southern European nations ( Healy , 2003; McKee , 1989 ) ( the study’s measure of temperature was mean annual temperature which differed from the temperature difference between maximum and minimum mortality used in our analysis although the two measures are correlated ) . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental ( e . g . housing insulation and heating ) and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of ( unintentional ) injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months ( Liu et al . , 2005 ) and are more common in men . The weakening of seasonality in boys under five years of age was related to two phenomena: first , the seasonality of death from cardiorespiratory diseases declined , and second , the proportion of deaths from perinatal conditions , which exhibit limited seasonality ( Figure 9—figure supplement 2 and Figure 10—figure supplement 3 ) , increased ( MacDorman and Gregory , 2015 ) . In contrast to young and middle ages , mortality in older ages , where death rates are highest , maintained persistent seasonality over a period of three decades ( we note that although the percent seasonal difference in mortality has remained largely unchanged in these ages , the absolute difference in death rates between the peak and minimum months has declined because total mortality has a declining long-term trend ) . This finding demonstrates the need for environmental and health service interventions targeted towards this group irrespective of geography and local climate . Examples of such interventions include enhancing the availability of both environmental and medical protective factors , such as better insulation of homes , winter heating provision and flu vaccinations , for the vulnerable older population ( Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group ( Healy , 2003; Lerchl , 1998; Katiyo et al . , 2017 ) . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions ( Morris , 2013 ) . Such interventions are important today , and will remain so as the population ages and climate change increases the within- and between-season weather variability .\nWe used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) . Age , sex , state of residence , month of death , and underlying cause of death were available for each record . The underlying cause of death was coded according to the international classification of diseases ( ICD ) system ( 9th revision of ICD from 1980 to 1998 and 10th revision of ICD thereafter ) . Yearly population counts were available from NCHS for 1990 to 2016 and from the US Census Bureau prior to 1990 ( Ingram et al . , 2003 ) . We calculated monthly population counts through linear interpolation , assigning each yearly count to July . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Figure 18 and Table 2 ) ( Karl and Koss , 1984 ) . On average , the Southeast and South are the hottest climate regions with average annual temperatures of 18 . 4°C and 18°C respectively; the South also possesses the highest average maximum monthly temperature ( 27 . 9°C in July ) . The lowest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the Southeast ( an average range of 17 . 5°C ) . The three coldest climate regions are West North Central , East North Central and the Northwest ( 7 . 6°C , 8 . 0°C , 8 . 2°C respectively ) . Mirroring the characteristics of the hottest climate regions , the largest variation in temperature throughout the year is that of the coldest region , West North Central ( an average range of 30 . 5°C ) , which also has the lowest average minimum monthly temperature ( −6 . 5°C in January ) . The other climate regions , Northeast , Southwest , and Central , possess similar average temperatures ( 10°C to 14°C ) and variation within the year of ( 23°C to 26°C ) , with the Northeast being the most populous region in the United States ( with 19 . 8% total population in 2016 ) . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We calculated monthly death rates for each age and sex group , both nationally and for sub-national climate regions . Death rate calculations accounted for varying length of months , by multiplying each month’s death count by a factor that would make it equivalent to a 31 day month . For analysis of seasonality by cause of death , we mapped each ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to four main disease categories ( Table 1 ) and to a number of subcategories which are presented in the Supplementary Note . Cardiorespiratory diseases and cancers accounted for 56 . 4% and 21 . 2% of all deaths in the USA , respectively , in 1980 , and 40 . 3% and 22 . 4% , respectively , in 2016 . Deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases have been associated with cold and warm temperatures ( Basu , 2009; Basu and Samet , 2002; Bennett et al . , 2014; Braga et al . , 2002; Gasparrini et al . , 2015 ) . Injuries , which accounted for 8% of all deaths in the USA in 1980 and 7 . 3% in 2016 , may have seasonality that is distinct from so-called natural causes . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We obtained data on temperature from ERA-Interim , which combines predictions from a physical model with ground-based and satellite measurements ( Dee et al . , 2011 ) . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . Wavelet analysis uncovers the presence , and frequency , of repeated maxima and minima in each age-sex-specific death rate time series ( Hubbard , 1998; Torrence and Compo , 1998 ) . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere ( Cazelles et al . , 2008 ) , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white ( an independent random process ) or red ( autoregressive of order one process ) noise . For each age-sex group , we calculated the p-values of the presence of 12 month seasonality for the comparison of wavelet power spectra of the entire study period ( 1980–2016 ) with 100 simulations against a white noise spectrum , which represents random fluctuations . We used the R package WaveletComp ( version 1 . 0 ) for the wavelet analysis . Before analysis , we de-trended death rates using a polynomial regression , and rescaled each death rate time series so as to range between 1 and −1 . To identify the months of maximum and minimum death rates , we calculated the centre of gravity and the negative centre of gravity of monthly death rates . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . In taking the weighted average , we allowed December ( month 12 ) to neighbour January ( month 1 ) , representing each month by an angle subtended from 12 equally-spaced points around a unit circle . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean ( θ- ) of the angles ( θ1 , θ2 , θ3… , θn , ) representing the deaths ( with n the total number of deaths in an age-sex group for a particular cause of death ) is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡ ( iθj ) , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The outcome of this calculation is then converted back into a month value ( Fisher , 1995 ) . Along with each circular mean , a 95% confidence interval ( CI ) was calculated by using 1000 bootstrap samples . The R package CircStats ( version 0 . 2 . 4 ) was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start ( 1980 ) and end ( 2016 ) of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death .",
         "In the USA , more deaths happen in the winter than the summer . But when deaths occur varies greatly by sex , age , cause of death , and possibly region . Seasonal differences in death rates can change over time due to changes in factors that cause disease or affect treatment . Analyzing the seasonality of deaths can help scientists determine whether interventions to minimize deaths during a certain time of year are needed , or whether existing ones are effective . Scrutinizing seasonal patterns in death over time can also help scientists determine whether large-scale weather or climate changes are affecting the seasonality of death . Now , Parks et al . show that there are age and sex differences in which times of year most deaths occur . Parks et al . analyzed data on US deaths between 1980 and 2016 . While overall deaths in a year were highest in winter and lowest in summer , a greater number of young men died during summer – mainly due to injuries – than during winter . Seasonal differences in deaths among young children have largely disappeared and seasonal differences in the deaths of older children and young adults have become smaller . Deaths among women and men aged 45 or older peaked between December and February – largely caused by respiratory and heart diseases , or injuries . Deaths in this older age group were lowest during the summer months . Death patterns in older people changed little over time . No regional differences were found in seasonal death patterns , despite large climate variation across the USA . The analysis by Parks et al . suggests public health and medical interventions have been successful in reducing seasonal deaths among many groups . But more needs to be done to address seasonal differences in deaths among older adults .

         "In temperate climates , winter deaths exceed summer ones . However , there is limited information on the timing and the relative magnitudes of maximum and minimum mortality , by local climate , age group , sex and medical cause of death . In these ages , percent difference in death rates between peak and minimum months did not vary across climate regions , nor changed from 1980 to 2016 . In a large country like the USA , which possesses distinct climate regions , the seasonality of mortality may vary geographically , due to geographical variations in mortality , localized weather patterns , and regional differences in adaptation measures such as heating , air conditioning and healthcare  . The presence and extent of seasonal variation in mortality may also itself change over time  . Although mortality seasonality is well-established , there is limited information on how seasonality , including the timing of minimum and maximum mortality , varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death  . We also used centre of gravity analysis and circular statistics methods to understand the timing of maximum and minimum mortality . The strengths of our study are its innovative methods of characterizing seasonality of mortality dynamically over space and time , by age group and cause of death; using wavelet and centre of gravity analyses; using ERA-Interim data output to compare the association between seasonality of death rates and regional temperature . We used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses , which allowed systematically identifying and characterizing seasonality of total and cause-specific mortality in the USA , and examining how seasonality has changed over time . We identified distinct seasonal patterns in relation to age and sex , including higher all-cause summer mortality in young men  . Few of these studies have done consistent national and subnational analyses , and none has done so over time , for a comprehensive set of age groups and causes of death , and in relation to regional temperature differences . Similarly , our results on seasonality of injury deaths are supported by a few prior studies  , but our subnational analysis over three decades revealed variations in when injury deaths peaked and in how seasonal differences in these deaths have changed over time in relation to age group which had not been reported before . The absence of variation in the magnitude of mortality seasonality indicates that different regions in the USA are similarly adapted to temperature seasonality , whereas Nordic countries may have better environmental  and health system measures to counter the effects of cold winters than those in southern Europe . If the observed absence of association between the magnitude of mortality seasonality and seasonal temperature difference across the climate regions also persists over time , the changes in temperature as a result of global climate change are unlikely to affect the winter-summer mortality difference . The cause-specific analysis showed that the substantial decline in seasonal mortality differences in adolescents and young adults was related to the diminishing seasonality of  injuries , especially from road traffic crashes , which are more likely to occur in the summer months  and are more common in men . Social interventions , including regular visits to the isolated elderly during peak mortality periods to ensure that they are optimally prepared for adverse conditions , and responsive and high-quality emergency care , are also important to protect this vulnerable group  . Emergent new technologies , such as always-connected hands-free communications devices with the outside world , in-house cameras , and personal sensors also provide an opportunity to enhance care for the older , more vulnerable groups in the population , especially in winter when the elderly have fewer social interactions  . We used data on all 85 , 854 , 176 deaths in the USA from 1980 to 2016 from the National Center for Health Statistics  . We also subdivided the national data geographically into nine climate regions used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   . Data were divided by sex and age in the following 10 age groups: 0–4 , 5–14 , 15-24 , 25–34 , 35–44 , 45–54 , 55–64 , 65–74 , 75–84 , 85+ years . We did not further divide other causes because the number of deaths could become too small to allow stable estimates when divided by age group , sex and climate region . We used gridded four-times-daily estimates at a resolution of 80 km to generate monthly population-weighted temperature by climate region throughout the analysis period . We used wavelet analysis to investigate seasonality for each age-sex group . In brief , a Morlet wavelet , described in detail elsewhere  , is equivalent to using a moving window on the death rate time series and analysing periodicity in each window using a short-form Fourier transform , hence generating a dynamic spectral analysis , which allows measuring dynamic seasonal patterns , in which the periodicity of death rates may disappear , emerge , or change over time . In addition to coefficients that measure the frequency of periodicity , wavelet analysis estimates the probability of whether the data are different from the null situation of random fluctuations that can be represented with white  or red  noise . Centre of gravity was calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , with each month weighted by its death rate; negative centre of gravity was also calculated as a weighted average of months of deaths , but with each month was weighted by the difference between its death rate and the year’s maximum death rate . Using a technique called circular statistics , a mean  of the angles  representing the deaths  is found using the relation below:θ-=arg∑j=1nexp⁡  , where arg denotes the complex number argument and θj denotes the month of death in angular form for a particular death j . The R package CircStats  was used for this analysis . For each age-sex group and cause of death , and for each year , we calculated the percent difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months . We fitted a linear regression to the time series of seasonal differences from 1980 to 2016 , and used the fitted trend line to estimate how much the percentage difference in death rates between the maximum and minimum mortality months had changed from 1980 to 2016 . We weighted seasonal difference by the inverse of the square of its standard error , which was calculated using a Poisson model to take population size of each age-sex group through time into account . This method gives us a p-value for the change in seasonal difference per year , which we used to calculate the seasonal difference at the start  and end  of the period of study . Our method of analysing seasonal differences avoids assuming that any specific month or group of months represent highest and lowest number of deaths for a particular cause of death , which is the approach taken by the traditional measure of Excess Winter Deaths . It also allows the maximum and minimum mortality months to vary by age group , sex and cause of death . "

         "Whether complement dysregulation directly contributes to the pathogenesis of peripheral nervous system diseases , including sensory neuropathies , is unclear . We addressed this important question in a mouse model of ocular HSV-1 infection , where sensory nerve damage is a common clinical problem . Through genetic and pharmacologic targeting , we uncovered a central role for C3 in sensory nerve damage at the morphological and functional levels . Interestingly , CD4 T cells were central in facilitating this complement-mediated damage . This same C3/CD4 T cell axis triggered corneal sensory nerve damage in a mouse model of ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . However , this was not the case in a T-dependent allergic eye disease ( AED ) model , suggesting that this inflammatory neuroimmune pathology is specific to certain disease etiologies . Collectively , these findings uncover a central role for complement in CD4 T cell-dependent corneal nerve damage in multiple disease settings and indicate the possibility for complement-targeted therapeutics to mitigate sensory neuropathies .\nDysregulated complement activation is increasingly recognized as a significant pathological event in a variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases of the central nervous system ( Tenner et al . , 2018 ) . These include conditions from Alzheimer’s disease and age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis ( Hong et al . , 2016; Knickelbein et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2018; Loveless et al . , 2018 ) . Complement may orchestrate peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) disorders as well . For instance , nociceptive hypersensitivities , sensory neuropathies , and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been linked to aberrant complement activation ( Rosoklija et al . , 2000; Ramaglia et al . , 2008; Jang et al . , 2010; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016; Xu et al . , 2018; Susuki et al . , 2007 ) . However , the mechanistic role of complement is not well understood in neuroinflammatory pathologies impacting the PNS . Moreover , the pathophysiological trigger of sensory fiber retraction which contributes to sensation loss and in some instances chronic pain is unclear ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Available treatments for peripheral neuropathies primarily focus on clinical symptoms without addressing the underlying pathomechanisms ( Colloca et al . , 2017 ) . Accordingly , elucidation of relevant pathomechanisms underlying sensory neuropathies may translate into efficacious mechanism-based therapeutics . The complement cascade is comprised of dozens of soluble and membrane-bound factors essential for host defense and efficient clearance of cellular debris . However , proper regulation of complement activation is necessary to balance immune responses and prevent collateral tissue damage ( Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . The complement cascade pivots upon activation of complement component 3 ( C3 ) for its downstream proinflammatory effects . The pathogenic contributions of complement in systemic disease have been reviewed extensively in recent years ( Dobó et al . , 2018; Hajishengallis et al . , 2017; McGeer et al . , 2017; Ricklin et al . , 2016 ) . Nonetheless , emerging concepts centering on complement effector synthesis within inflamed tissue microenvironments have ushered in a ‘renaissance’ of novel complement-targeted drug development strategies ( Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Therefore , elucidating whether the complement cascade is a viable therapeutic target in inflammation-associated peripheral nerve impairment remains medically important . The eye has been labeled a ‘complement dysregulation hotspot’ due to complement’s contributions to many ophthalmic diseases , but complement activation is restricted in the healthy cornea ( Clark and Bishop , 2018 ) . As observed in AMD , subtle inflammatory reactions in the eye can mediate significant visual morbidity . Accordingly , ocular inflammation is tightly regulated by various anatomic , physiologic , and immunologic mechanisms in order to maintain visual acuity ( Amouzegar et al . , 2016; Streilein , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2018 ) . These homeostatic mechanisms , collectively dubbed ‘ocular immune privilege , ’ help preserve the ocular surface and enable the cornea to properly focus incoming light onto the retina . Furthermore , corneal nerves are increasingly recognized as central regulators of immune privilege at the ocular surface ( Guzmán et al . , 2018; Neelam et al . , 2018; Paunicka et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , inflammatory events that damage corneal nerves can have insidious consequences in terms of ocular surface health and transparency ( Müller et al . , 2003; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . One such pathway that can rapidly initiate inflammation following activation is the complement cascade . Corneal nerves originate predominantly from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion ( TG ) , and these peripheral nerves provide the cornea with the highest density of sensory fibers in the human body . While the cornea and peripheral nerves constitutively synthesize complement proteins ( Bora et al . , 2008; de Jonge et al . , 2004 ) , the role of the complement cascade in corneal nerve damage has not been explored . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is poised for vigorous activation in the cornea in response to noxious or inflammatory stimuli ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , C3 activation has been reported in the cornea soon after infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) , which is a common cause of corneal sensory nerve damage in patients ( Royer et al . , 2017; Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014 ) . Given the cornea’s high density of sensory nerves , it is particularly amenable for investigating the mechanistic role of complement in peripheral nerve damage . To this end , we evaluated corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function using a murine model of ocular HSV-1 infection to test the hypothesis that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage . The pathobiology underlying non-penetrating corneal nerve damage is not well understood , although inflammation is generally recognized as an important feature ( Neelam et al . , 2018; Shaheen et al . , 2014; Cruzat et al . , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017a ) . While HSV-1 is a clinically prominent cause of corneal nerve damage and sensation loss , a variety of pathogenic microbes impair the corneal nerve architecture upon ocular infection ( Cruzat et al . , 2015 ) . This observation adds to evidence that the neurotropism of HSV-1 is not directly responsible for nerve damage ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2016 ) . In addition to sensation loss evoked by HSV-1 , corneal nerve alterations in other contexts such as dry eye disease are associated with a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . To further qualify the possible role of complement in corneal nerve damage independent of infection , we evaluated corneal mechanosensory function in two noninfectious T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . For this purpose , we utilized established murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Our rationale for this is that complement has been implicated in the etiology of systemic GVHD and allergic inflammation ( Gour et al . , 2018; Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Nguyen et al . , 2018; Zhang and Köhl , 2010 ) . However , a neuroinflammatory role of complement has not been described for either disease within the eye . The translational relevance of this study is underscored by in vivo confocal microscopy data from multiple clinical studies showing architectural changes in the corneal nerves of patients with herpetic keratitis , chronic ocular allergy , and ocular GVHD ( Hamrah et al . , 2010; Müller et al . , 2015; Moein et al . , 2018; Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012; Tepelus et al . , 2017; He et al . , 2017a ) . Elucidating the pathomechanisms underlying corneal nerve damage may enable development of more effective therapeutics to mitigate progression of such ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Each of the animal models utilized herein mimic clinically important , chronic ocular surface morbidities . Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) is a common cause of neurotropic keratitis and remains a leading cause of infectious corneal blindness ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2014; Farooq and Shukla , 2012 ) . The incidence of ocular allergy exceeds twenty percent of the population with varying degrees of neurogenic ocular surface discomfort that can severely diminish quality of life ( Craig et al . , 2017; Patel et al . , 2017; Saban et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , GVHD is the greatest cause of non-relapse morbidity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) used to treat life-threatening malignancies and immunologic diseases ( MacDonald et al . , 2017 ) . A majority of patients with chronic presentations of GVHD suffer from ocular surface involvement ( Shikari et al . , 2013 ) .\nAdaptive immunity has been shown to prevent recovery of corneal sensory function following ocular HSV-1 infection ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , but the initial pathophysiological triggers of denervation and sensation loss are not definitively characterized . Ocular HSV-1 infection provokes corneal denervation and sensation loss between days 5 to 8 post-infection ( p . i . ) in immunologically naive C57BL/6 mice ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . This tempo appears to be synchronized with the host transition from innate to adaptive immunity following infection . Indeed , corneal nerve fiber retraction was evident upon T cell infiltration in the cornea ( Figure 1A ) . Accordingly , we hypothesized that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage during HSV-1 infection . To address our hypothesis , corneal sensation and pathogen burden were evaluated in C57BL/6 wildtype ( WT ) and complement C3-deficient ( C3-/- ) mice following ocular HSV-1 infection . Progressive loss of corneal mechano-sensitivity was evident in WT mice by days 5 to 8 p . i . , but corneal sensation was conserved in the C3-/- cohort ( Figure 1B ) . The same trend revealing preservation of corneal sensation in C3-/- animals was also observed with an increased HSV-1 challenge inoculum ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Viral titers were measured at time points before and after the onset of corneal sensation loss to determine whether the divergence in sensation stemmed from a differential susceptibility to infection . On day 3 p . i . , the HSV-1 burden was similar in the tear film , corneas , and TG of WT and C3-/- animals ( Figure 1C–D ) . By day 7 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were elevated in the tear film and TG of C3-/- mice relative to WT ( Figure 1C , E ) . Corneal buttons from WT mice exhibited extensive denervation with CD3+ T cell infiltration at day 8 p . i . ( Figure 1F ) . However , T cell infiltration was observed without widespread denervation in C3-/- corneas ( Figure 1F ) . The number of cornea-infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were similar among WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1G ) . Together , these data indicate that corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis involves a C3-dependent inflammatory process independent of viral burden . Although T cells successfully extravasate into the corneas of WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 1F , G ) , C3-deficiency can have broad impacts on T cell priming , clonal expansion , and recruitment ( Clarke and Tenner , 2014; West et al . , 2018 ) . To investigate this possibility , corneas from HSV-1-infected WT and C3-/- mice were evaluated for chemokines associated with T cell recruitment , and the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) were harvested to evaluate T cell responses . Chemokines associated with T cell recruitment were elevated in corneas from both WT and C3-/- mice at day 5 p . i . —a time consistent with onset of sensation loss ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion was comparable within the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes ( MLN ) from WT and C3-/- mice ( Figure 2B ) . Similarly , T cells harvested from WT and C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . responded equally to in vitro stimulation in terms of IFNγ production ( Figure 2C ) . Collectively , these data show that C3-/- T cells exhibit normal expansion and recruitment to the cornea during ocular HSV-1 infection . In support of our hypothesis that C3 and T cells jointly coordinate corneal sensation loss , frank corneal sensation loss was not observed following ocular HSV-1 infection in C3-sufficient , alpha-beta T cell receptor-deficient mice ( TCRα-/- ) which congenitally lack classical CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ( Figure 2D ) . To investigate potential functional defects of C3-/- T cells in an in vivo context , CD3+ T cells were harvested from HSV-infected WT or C3-/- mice at day 8 p . i . and adoptively transferred into TCRα-/- mice . Six days following cell transfer , TCRα-/- recipients were infected with HSV-1 and corneal sensation monitored longitudinally . Adoptive transfer of CD3+ T cells from either WT or C3-/- donors evoked progressive corneal sensation loss in TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2D ) . These findings further corroborate that C3-/- T cells remain functional in vivo . Analysis of corneal sensation was not feasible beyond 8 days p . i . , as the TCRα-/- mice succumbed to herpetic encephalitis . However , engraftment of donor cells was confirmed by analysis of T cells in the eye-draining MLN of recipient mice by flow cytometry at day 8 p . i . The baseline lymphocyte counts in MLN from TCRα-/- controls likely reflect expansion of non-classical T cell populations ( Viney et al . , 1994 ) . An increase in total cell number was observed for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells upon adoptive transfer of purified CD3+ T cells into TCRα-/- recipient mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Consistent with this observation , our data show that transfer of CD3+ T cells from HSV-infected mice have no appreciable impact on HSV-1 titers in the TG of TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . i . ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Notably , bulk transfer of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells has been shown to reduce viral burden in the peripheral nervous system of C57BL/6 mice during acute HSV-1 infection ( Conrady et al . , 2009; Royer et al . , 2016 ) . Our collective findings reveal that C3 and T cells are individually necessary and interdependent in the pathogenesis of HSV-1-associated corneal sensation loss . Whether by direct or indirect mechanisms , these data support a paradigm in which C3 activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage in herpetic keratitis . Our data show that T cells contribute to corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection , yet whether this pathology is dependent upon CD4+ or CD8+ T cells remained unclear . To better discern the contributions of each subset , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested from infected WT mice , transferred into separate groups of TCRα-/- mice , and recipient mice subsequently infected with HSV-1 . Corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection was only observed upon reconstitution with CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3A ) . Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by flow cytometry , although a statistically significant increase in cell number within the eye-draining MLN was only observed upon transfer of CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The requirement for antigen specificity was subsequently evaluated during acute HSV-1 infection by monitoring corneal sensation in WT and OT-II transgenic mice that generate ovalbumin ( OVA ) -specific CD4 T cells . Transgenic OT-II mice did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following infection despite evidence of bystander CD4+ T cell activation and recruitment into the cornea ( Figure 3B–D ) . Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from HSV-infected WT and OT-II mice into TCRα-/- recipients corroborated these findings ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Abrasion of the corneal epithelium , which is required to mediate infection in this model , induces local chemokine expression capable of recruiting T cells to the cornea even in the absence of viral infection ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Nonetheless , active corneal HSV-1 infection was necessary to provoke corneal sensation loss , as TCRα-/- mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells harvested from HSV-infected WT mice did not elicit auto/allo-antigen-associated sensation loss within two weeks of corneal scratch injury ( i . e . mock infection ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Collectively , our data show that complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are simultaneously necessary to drive corneal sensation loss during HSV-1 infection . These results strongly portend that a coordinated inflammatory axis exists involving C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells , and that it is responsible for sensory neuropathy in herpetic keratitis . Complement-mediated tissue pathology can arise from complement activators synthesized by the liver ( systemic complement ) or in tissue microenvironments ( local complement ) . While local complement activation and regulation have been reported in the cornea in health and disease ( Bora et al . , 1993; Clark and Bishop , 2018; Mondino and Brady , 1981; Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) , the expression profile and cellular sources of various complement components have not been investigated in the context of ocular HSV-1 infection . To this end , a modest array of complement component transcripts was evaluated by semiquantitative real-time PCR on corneal buttons from healthy and HSV-infected mice at day 2 and 7 p . i . Upregulation of complement effectors and anaphylatoxin receptors were noted including C3 , C5 , C3ar1 , and C5ar1 ( Figure 4A , B ) . Constitutive expression of complement receptor 2 ( CD21 ) has been reported in the corneal epithelium ( Levine et al . , 1990 ) , but variances in its expression during HSV-1 infection were not statistically significant across the time points evaluated ( Figure 4B ) . Likewise , no differences in the local expression of various complement regulators were observed in HSV-infected corneas aside from the C1-inhibitor SerpinG1 ( Table 1 , Figure 4C ) . Collectively , this expression profile favors local complement activation , as effectors are upregulated without proportional enhancement of pathway regulatory components . As C3 is the central component of the complement activation pathway , the cellular sources of complement C3 were evaluated in corneas infected with HSV-1 . Monocytes and tissue macrophages are known sources of C3 ( Einstein et al . , 1977; Lubbers et al . , 2017; Morgan and Gasque , 1997; Verschoor et al . , 2001 ) , thus CSF1R+ cells from the peripheral blood of transgenic CSF1R-GFP mice ( MAFIA ) were utilized as the relative standard for C3 transcript expression . Expression of C3 was noted in CD45+ leukocytes isolated from infected corneas , yet detection of C3 expression was lost when CSF1R+ cells were removed from the total CD45+ pool . In addition , isolated EpCAM+ corneal epithelial cells expressed C3 at levels comparable to blood monocytes . However , the C3 expression level was greater in whole-cornea preparations than among individual cell fractions ( Figure 4D ) . Taken together , our data show that both tissue-resident non-hematopoietic cells and resident/infiltrating CSF1R+ leukocytes contribute to local C3 expression in the cornea during acute HSV-1 infection . Ocular HSV-1 infection amplifies local complement gene expression , yet whether local control of complement activation can be harnessed to prevent corneal nerve damage has not been explored . From a clinical perspective , modulating complement activation at the ocular surface may be a viable therapeutic option . As a proof of concept , daily ocular cobra venom factor ( CVF ) treatment was explored as a putative method to deplete C3 and preserve corneal sensation during acute HSV-1 infection . Vehicle ( PBS ) -treated mice exhibited corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection , but CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation ( Figure 5A ) . Protein levels of C3 remained near baseline in the cornea following CVF treatment during HSV-1 infection , yet vehicle-treated animals exhibited a 300–600% increase in C3 protein levels in the cornea at days 3 and 7 p . i . ( Figure 5B ) . Ocular CVF treatment did not significantly impact systemic serum C3 concentrations throughout the study ( Figure 5C ) . Ocular CVF treatment limited corneal edema during HSV-1 infection relative to the vehicle control ( Figure 5D ) . Consistent with this observation , CVF-treated animals had less leukocytic infiltrate ( CD45+ ) into the cornea at day 3 p . i . and , specifically , fewer infiltrating CSF1R+ cells ( Figure 5E , F ) . By day 7 p . i . , no difference in total CD45+ or CSF1R+ cells were observed in the cornea , yet there was a reduction in the total number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells ( Figure 5G ) . Despite the difference in CSF1R+ cell infiltration into the corneas at day 3 p . i . , HSV-1 titers were similar in the corneas and TG comparing vehicle- and CVF-treated animals ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . By day 7 p . i . CVF-treated animals had less virus in the corneas and TG than vehicle controls ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting that CVF may have unexpected antiviral effects . However , CVF treatment did not have any discernable impact on T cell expansion in the eye-draining MLN or the total number of circulating CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells in HSV-1 infected animals ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Collectively , these findings imply that complement-targeted therapeutics could be tailored for ophthalmic use to limit tissue inflammation and preserve corneal sensation . While complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells appear to coordinate corneal sensation loss in herpetic keratitis , it remained to be determined whether this phenomenon was specific to HSV-1 infection . To this end , corneal sensation was measured independent of infection in two T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Murine models of allergic eye disease ( AED ) and ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) were employed to further delineate the hypothesized role of T cells in coordinating corneal nerve damage ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . First , AED was induced using an established systemic ovalbumin ( OVA ) -sensitization and ocular challenge model ( Figure 6A ) mimicking aspects of chronic keratoconjunctivitis ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Clinical signs of ocular allergy developed as anticipated in OVA-challenged mice ( Figure 6B ) , yet corneal sensation loss was not observed ( Figure 6C ) . Consistent with development of AED , corneas from OVA-challenged mice exhibited CD3+ T cell infiltration by challenge day 7 ( Figure 6D ) . However , frank corneal nerve loss was not observed in AED ( Figure 6D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the preservation of corneal nerve density during AED ( Figure 6E ) , although CD3+ T cell numbers were elevated in sensitized animals relative to healthy controls ( Figure 6F ) . Flow cytometry was used to verify that the cornea-infiltrating T cells were predominately CD4+ in the AED model ( Figure 6G ) . Although clinical data show that corneal nerve remodeling can occur in patients with chronic ocular allergy ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011 ) , allergy symptoms were not accompanied by frank loss of corneal mechano-sensation in the AED animal model . Corneal sensation was also evaluated in a T cell-dependent allogeneic model of chronic GVHD with systemic and ocular manifestations following hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) transplantation ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . This minor histocompatibility antigen mismatch model was established by transferring HSC-rich bone marrow ( BM ) and purified T cells from C57BL/6 ( H2b ) donors into lethally irradiated sex-matched C3 . SW-H2b recipients . Recipient controls that receive BM without T cells recover and do not develop GVHD ( Figure 7A ) . Onset of GVHD was established by transfer of BM with CD4+ T cells only , CD8+ T cells only , or both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . Progressive corneal sensation loss was observed following transfer of CD4+ T cells with and without addition of CD8+ T cells . Addition of CD8+ T cells alone evoked a transient corneal sensation deficit that recovered by day 26 post-transplant . However , corneal sensation loss was not observed in the BM only control group ( Figure 7B ) . External signs of ocular disease ( see Table 2 ) were also apparent in groups receiving CD4+ T cells by the study endpoint ( Figure 7C ) . The presence of tissue-infiltrating CD3+ T cells in corneas from animals with GVHD was verified by confocal microscopy at the study endpoint . Consistent with sensation loss , corneal nerve integrity was markedly reduced in groups receiving CD4+ T cells ( Figure 7D ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the CD4-dependent decrease in corneal nerve density ( Figure 7E ) and concomitant increase in total CD3+ cells ( Figure 7F ) . Taken together , our data show for the first time that corneal sensation loss occurs early in ocular GVHD and that this pathology is instigated in part by allogeneic CD4+ T cells . The pharmacologic impact of local CVF treatment on ocular GVHD progression was consequently explored in order to identify whether the CD4+ T cell-associated corneal sensation loss observed in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GVHD shared a common C3-codependent pathomechanism . For these experiments , GVHD was established in C3 . SW-H2b recipients by transfer of C57BL/6-derived BM and CD3+ T cells . Recipients from the BM only control and GVHD cohorts received ophthalmic treatment with either PBS or CVF ( Figure 8A ) . Systemic disease progressed equally in both GVHD cohorts regardless of treatment ( Figure 8B ) . Although CVF administration was limited to the eye , systemic serum C3 concentrations were lower in the GVHD cohort treated with CVF compared to the PBS-treated GVHD groups at the study endpoint . Nonetheless , the inverted CD4:CD8 T cell ratio ( Herretes et al . , 2015 ) in the spleens and eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes of both groups of GVHD mice confirmed the presence of systemic disease ( Figure 8D ) . Despite development of systemic disease , local CVF treatment preserved corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD ( Figure 8E , F ) . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks from the study endpoint corroborated the preservation of corneal nerve density in CVF-treated mice from the GVHD cohort ( Figure 8G ) , although CVF did not reduce the number of total CD3+ cells during GVHD relative to PBS ( Figure 8H ) . In addition , CVF treatment also limited GVHD-associated periocular disease in female but not in male mice ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . In summary , these preclinical models establish that CD4+ T cells and complement C3 coordinate corneal sensory nerve damage in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GHVD . Moreover , our data provide a proof of principle that complement-targeted therapeutics may limit the severity of immune-mediated sensory nerve damage at the ocular surface .\nMechanistic advances in our understanding of the complement cascade’s physiologic regulation and pathologic contributions in disease have predictably spawned substantial investments in complement-targeted drug development over the past decade ( Harris et al . , 2018; Ricklin et al . , 2018; Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . The ocular surface is a unique milieu in which pharmacologic modulation of the complement pathway may limit the severity of inflammatory disease and improve clinical outcomes . This study provides proof of concept that such interventions may have important clinical impacts on ocular surface disease , and specifically neuropathic sensory disorders affecting the cornea . Complement-targeted drug development for ophthalmic use has almost exclusively focused on AMD with some interest in neuromyelitis optica ( NMO ) , Stargardt disease , and autoimmune uveitis ( Harris et al . , 2018; Pittock et al . , 2013 ) . By July 2019 , there were no complement-specific therapeutics indicated for ocular surface use registered on www . clinicaltrials . gov ( search strings: ‘complement’ / ‘C3’ / ‘C5’ / ‘eculizumab’ AND ‘cornea’ , ‘conjunctiva’ , ‘dry eye’ , ‘keratitis’ , OR ‘ocular surface’ ) . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of several ocular surface diseases ( Bora et al . , 2008 ) . The current investigation provides an important advancement in this arena by demonstrating that dysregulated complement activation can specifically contribute to sensory nerve damage in the cornea . While corneal nerves are increasingly implicated in maintenance of corneal immune privilege ( Paunicka et al . , 2015; Neelam et al . , 2018; Guzmán et al . , 2018 ) , this study is the first to identify that C3 is involved in the pathobiology of corneal sensory nerve damage . However , the individual fates of damaged corneal nerves were not explored herein . Lessons from peripheral nerve injury in other settings indicate that some damaged nerves undergo apoptosis , yet effectively promoting functional regeneration of surviving neurons remains a major clinical hurtle ( Doron-Mandel et al . , 2015; Menorca et al . , 2013; Scheib and Höke , 2013; Shacham-Silverberg et al . , 2018 ) . Likewise , promoting functional regeneration of damaged corneal nerves is important for restoration of immune privilege and ocular surface health . Our approach evaluated sensory nerve damage in murine models of T cell-dependent ocular surface disease including HSV-1 keratitis , OVA-induced AED , and ocular GHVD . The lack of a sensory phenotype in the AED model was unanticipated in light of evidence that patients with severe allergy exhibit changes in corneal nerve morphology ( Hu et al . , 2008; Le et al . , 2011; Leonardi et al . , 2012 ) . This contrasting model underscores the context-dependency of sensation loss during corneal inflammation . While we focused on C3 in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD due to the direct link to overt corneal sensation loss , complement may still have an important role in mediating neurogenic hypersensitivities in AED . In addition to loss of mechano-sensory function , corneal nerve pathologies can involve a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain ( Andersen et al . , 2017 ) . Inflammatory mediators facilitate neuropathic hypersensitivities , but the therapeutic potential of complement inhibition is often overlooked ( Baral et al . , 2019; Fritzinger and Benjamin , 2016 ) . Moreover , the cornea produces many neurotrophic factors that influence sensory innervation in health and disease ( Sacchetti and Lambiase , 2017; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . Given the involvement of C3 activation in sensory nerve damage , future investigation into crosstalk between complement and other neurotropic factors in the cornea is warranted . Furthermore , AED is driven primarily by a combined Th2/Th17 CD4 T cell response that differs from the Th1 bias observed in HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD ( Herretes et al . , 2015; Saban et al . , 2013; Tang and Hendricks , 1996 ) . This suggests that Th1 cytokines such as IFNγ , IL-2 , and lymphotoxin-alpha may be important in coordinating corneal sensation loss . Nonetheless , the unique inflammatory milieus and differential polarizations of cornea-infiltrating T cells across these disease models may also influence the downstream effects of complement activation in the tissue microenvironment ( Tomlinson and Thurman , 2018 ) . Future studies are needed to broaden the scope of these observations to other peripheral nerve diseases . For example , complement-mediated microvascular damage in diabetes correlates with neuropathy ( Rasmussen et al . , 2018; Rosoklija et al . , 2000 ) . While diabetic peripheral neuropathy can lead to neurotropic corneal ulcerations ( Gao et al . , 2016b ) , the role of complement in diabetic corneal disease is currently unknown . Complement enhances clearance of infected cells and nascent virions during HSV-1 infection ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987 ) . Importantly , HSV-1 can also evade C3 activation through endogenous expression of glycoprotein C ( gC ) . By limiting C3b deposition on infected cells and nascent virions , gC can inhibit subsequent C5 binding and membrane attack complex ( MAC ) formation ( Kostavasili et al . , 1997; Lubinski et al . , 2002; McNearney et al . , 1987; Tegla et al . , 2011 ) . This could explain why herpetic keratitis is less severe in rabbits infected with a gC-deficient strain of HSV-1 during acute infection ( Drolet et al . , 2004 ) . However , this gC-mediated viral evasion strategy may also be cell type-dependent . Cell culture modeling indicates that neuronal cells maintain host-encoded complement regulator expression more efficiently and are more resistant to MAC deposition than epithelial cells upon HSV-1 infection ( Rautemaa et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , complement-mediated sensory nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis may reflect a maladaptive outcome of host-defense . This is consistent with our data showing that immunologically naive C3-/- mice maintain corneal sensation and innervation , yet they exhibit concomitant enhancement of viral shedding in the tear film and increased viral burden in the TG by day 7 p . i . The absence of a concordant difference in HSV-1 titers in corneas from WT and C3-/- mice is likely explained by the potent antiviral effects of type-1 interferon ( Conrady et al . , 2011; Royer and Carr , 2016 ) . This suggests that the maintenance of corneal innervation in C3-/- mice enables enhanced shedding of nascent virions produced within the TG . Moreover , there is no difference in the amount of latent HSV-1 in the TG of naive WT and C3-/- mice 30 days after ocular HSV-1 challenge ( Royer et al . , 2019 ) . Taken together , this evidence indicates that although C3 is involved in progression of keratitis and sensory nerve fiber retraction during acute infection , it likely does not contribute to complete elimination of infected nerves . The studies reported herein involve immunologically naive mice , but the impacts of preexisting humoral immune responses on complement pathway activation and regulation in the cornea during HSV-1 infection remain incompletely understood . This point is of considerable importance clinically , as herpes-associated neurotropic keratitis typically develops as a result of recurrent corneal infections in patients ( Hamrah et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , we have recently reported that C3 is essential for optimal antibody-dependent viral clearance following ocular HSV-1 challenge in mice ( Royer et al . , 2019; Royer et al . , 2017 ) . While vaccinated animals did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following ocular HSV-1 infection in those studies , deposition of the terminal C3 cleavage product C3d was present in the corneal epithelium ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Host gene expression data herein corroborates that HSV-1 infection creates an imbalance in the local complement effector to regulator expression ratios that contribute to aberrant complement pathway activation in the cornea . This imbalance in ‘complement proteostasis’ may favor deposition of complement fragments and sublytic MAC on corneal sensory nerve fibers ( Tegla et al . , 2011; Triantafilou et al . , 2013 ) . Notwithstanding , the nerve-intrinsic molecular mechanisms responsible for trigeminal sensory fiber retraction , neuronal death , or axonal regeneration in the cornea are largely unknown ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Future work is needed to identify the respective complement activation pathways involved in pathologic and protective immune responses to HSV-1 in the cornea . Identification of the complement pathway’s role in initiating corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection is an important advancement in the mechanistic understanding of this disease process , as it introduces an array of potential drug targets for local therapy . Previous observations note that complement activation in antigen-induced keratitis may be mediated by cellular immune mechanisms ( Verhagen et al . , 1992 ) . The identification of CSF1R+ macrophages/monocytes as a local source of C3 during infection ( Figure 4D ) is also critical , as these cells are recruited to the cornea in the early stages of HSV-1 infection and are associated with corneal nerve damage in HSV-1 keratitis ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Conrady et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , CD4 T cells coordinate this pathology . Our data corroborate findings from the Hendricks’ lab showing that CD4 T cells are associated with corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 keratitis ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , yet our adoptive transfer experiments establish that this process is not dependent upon endogenous C3 production by cornea-infiltrating donor T cells ( Figure 2D ) . Notably , the tempo of HSV-associated sensation loss was consistent among models once initiated ( Figure 1B , Figure 2D , Figure 3A ) . However , the initial onset was delayed by one day in the adoptive transfer model . This likely reflects the relative lymphopenic status of T cell-reconstituted TCRα-/- mice compared to WT mice ( compare Figure 2B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 infection and ocular GVHD shared a common mechanism dependent upon CD4+ T cells and complement C3 . The role of intracellular C3 in regulating human Th1 responses has received much attention in recent years ( Elvington et al . , 2017; Hansen et al . , 2019; Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Such studies involve CD3 and CD46 stimulation to activate human CD4 T cells in vitro . However , mice do not express CD46 . Instead , anaphylatoxin receptor signaling has been shown to modulate Th1 cytokine production in murine T cells ( Strainic et al . , 2008 ) . Our ex vivo re-stimulation data clearly show that there is no defect in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice following HSV-1 infection . Others have shown similar data based on T cell proliferation in response to re-stimulation with HSV-1 antigen ( Da Costa et al . , 1999 ) . In contrast , a reduction in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice was reported following in vitro expansion under Th1 polarizing conditions ( Liszewski et al . , 2013 ) . Nonetheless , it is possible that anaphylatoxin receptor signaling from locally produced C3a ( and potentially C5a generated downstream ) modulates T cell effector function upon extravasation into the inflamed cornea . The precise relationships between T cells and C3 in our mouse models of corneal neuropathic disease remain to be identified . Our working hypothesis involves an indirect mechanism whereby sublytic MAC deposition from local complement activation damages sensory nerves , which are then cleared by T cell-activated phagocytes or other cytolytic cells . These could include tissue-resident and infiltrating leukocytes ( macrophages , monocytes , dendritic cells , and NK cells ) as well as nerve-associated corneal epithelial cells ( Buela and Hendricks , 2015; Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2017b; Gao et al . , 2016a; Koyama and Hill , 2016; Liu et al . , 2017; Royer et al . , 2018; Seyed-Razavi et al . , 2014; Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . Emerging evidence indicates that the plasma membranes of corneal nerves and epithelial cells fuse thereby enabling cytosolic exchange ( Stepp et al . , 2017 ) . In light of this , it is plausible that complement-mediated damage to corneal epithelial cells has a direct impact on sensory nerves . Although corneal nerve damage is an established pathology in animal models of HSV-1 infection ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015; He et al . , 2017b; Yun et al . , 2014 ) , this is the first report documenting loss of corneal mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD . Notably , patients rarely exhibit neurological manifestations of GVHD affecting other tissues/organs ( Grauer et al . , 2010 ) . Corneal sensation loss may provide a clinical benchmark for initiation of targeted therapies to curb progression of ocular GVHD in patients . Data from our animal model of GVHD suggest that corneal sensation loss is an early warning sign of progressive ocular and systemic GVHD . Corneal sensation measurements are warranted in patients following HSCT to substantiate this finding among those who develop chronic GVHD . Published imaging studies confirm that corneal nerve remodeling occurs in patients with ocular GVHD ( He et al . , 2017a; Tepelus et al . , 2017 ) ; therefore , clinical studies to delineate the kinetics of disease onset are needed . Complement C3 is a known driver of systemic GVHD ( Kwan et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Seignez et al . , 2017 ) , and our data show that aberrant complement pathway activation also contributes to the pathogenesis of ocular GVHD including corneal sensation loss . Furthermore , localized CVF treatment preserved corneal sensation in both sexes during ocular GVHD , but treatment only abrogated other facets of ocular surface disease in female mice . This dimorphic outcome may reflect insufficient maintenance of C3 depletion in the ocular surface microenvironment , as animals were only treated twice weekly . Furthermore , complement activity is reportedly limited by terminal pathway components in female mice compared to males ( Kotimaa et al . , 2016 ) . Collectively , our data suggest that sensory nerve involvement may be a unique facet and treatment target in ocular GVHD . While the complement pathway has many components , C3 is the heart of the pathway and its activation products mediate virtually all downstream pathway functions . Accordingly , we used CVF to target complement activation in models of HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD as a proof of concept for local delivery of complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface disease . In contrast to the neurotoxic effects of complete cobra venom , purified CVF is a ‘nontoxic’ derivative . CVF forms a biochemically stable convertase to rapidly hydrolyze mammalian C3 and C5 . This ultimately results in complement inactivation via effector consumption ( Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . The only recorded side effect of purified CVF administration in rodents is transitory anaphylatoxin-mediated pulmonary inflammation resulting in acute respiratory distress ( Proctor et al . , 2006; Vogel and Fritzinger , 2010 ) . In our hands , respiratory distress was observed in some mice following the initial sub-conjunctival CVF injection irrespective of group assignment ( animals were euthanized ) . However , topical CVF administration did not provoke respiratory or corneal abnormalities in any animals . Previous findings also show that topical CVF administration has no obvious effects on corneal health or transparency ( Zaidi et al . , 2010 ) . Experimental CVF administration was once thought to directly stimulate T cells , but such effects were later attributed to mitogen contamination ( Rumjanek et al . , 1978; Cauvi et al . , 2012 ) . Because our disease models were T cell-dependent , we utilized highly-purified CVF from a commercial source for our studies . Moreover , we found no evidence to suggest that CVF impacted T cell responses outside of the eye . Local CVF treatment reduced corneal T cell infiltration following HSV-1 infection ( Figure 5G ) . However , this is likely due to reduced inflammation overall in C3-depleted corneas ( Figure 5D ) . Likewise , ocular CVF treatment in the GVHD model did not impact on the total numbers of T cells in the corneas at the experiment endpoint . However , we have not excluded the possibility that CVF treatment may delay the tempo of T cell influx . Nonetheless , CVF administration preserved corneal sensation in both disease models . By addressing the ‘heart’ of the complement pathway ( C3 ) , this study opens the door to future investigation to further elucidate the relevant pathomechanisms and corresponding therapeutic targets . The relevant complement activation pathways ( classical , alternative , lectin , terminal ) , cellular targets , and impacts of anaphylatoxin receptor signaling are topics of future investigation . Complement activation is a double-edged sword in the cornea , as activation can be either protective or harmful . Low-level complement turnover is observed in healthy corneas/tears , and complement may even contribute to the relative ‘paucibacterial’ state of the ocular surface microbiome ( Doan et al . , 2016; McDermott , 2013; Willcox et al . , 1997 ) . The mechanisms regulating each complement-mediated effect remain incompletely understood . Elucidation of how complement activation is triggered , the relevant molecular mechanisms of its downstream signaling , and contributions to pathology will promote an important advancement in drug development for ocular surface disease . Animal models are necessary for mechanistic studies when it comes to understanding complement pathway regulation , especially in dynamic tissue microenvironments; however , differences in complement regulation exist between mouse and man that will also have to be resolved to further assess the translational potential ( Jacobson and Weis , 2008 ) . This certainly applies to putative complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface treatment . Even among individual patients , small nucleotide polymorphisms evoke changes in complement activity that have major impacts on disease risks . Such genetic linkages , dubbed ‘complotype , ’ are important in differential susceptibility to AMD ( Harris et al . , 2012; Paun et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , complotype differences may help explain differential susceptibility patterns in a variety of ocular surface diseases . Our data herein have demonstrated successful prophylactic intervention in repressing complement-mediated sensory nerve pathology in two well characterized experimental T cell-dependent corneal disease models . Other avenues of future investigation are also needed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic intervention on established ocular surface diseases . Successful implementation of complement-targeted therapeutics for topical ophthalmic use may provide the benefit of controlling insidious ocular surface diseases without the risks associated with systemic therapies .\nMouse strains were originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . These include: C57BL/6 , C3-/- ( stock #029661 ) , TCRα-/- ( stock # 002116 ) , OT-II ( stock #004194 ) , MAFIA/CSF1R-GFP ( stock #005070 ) , C3 . SW-H2b ( stock #000438 ) , and B6-GFP ( stock #003291 ) . Colonies were maintained in select-pathogen-free vivaria at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center or Duke University Medical Center . Research was performed in accordance with protocols approved by respective institutional animal care and use committees . For all procedures relating to ocular HSV-1 infection , C57BL/6-background mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and euthanized by cardiac perfusion ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . For infection , corneas were scratched to expose the epithelium and 1000 plaque forming units ( PFU ) of HSV-1 McKrae was applied to each eye . Viral stocks were propagated and infectious titers quantified by standard plaque assay on Vero cells ( American Type Culture Collection , Manassas , VA ) as previously reported ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . For adoptive transfers , T cells were purified from splenocyte preparations using a BioRad S3e cell sorter ( Hercules , CA ) . Corneal complement C3 depletion was achieved by subconjunctival injection of CVF ( Cat . # 233552 , Millipore Sigma , Burlington , MA ) followed by topical maintenance dosing as described in respective figure legends . Allergic eye disease was initiated in B6 mice as previously described ( Ahadome et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2015; Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , hypersensitivity was elicited via intraperitoneal immunization with 10 μg ovalbumin ( OVA ) adjuvanted with 1 mg Alum and 300 ng pertussis toxin ( all from Sigma-Aldrich Corp . , St . Louis , MO ) . Ocular allergy was subsequently induced via daily eyedrop challenge containing 250 μg OVA ( Figure 6A ) . Clinical signs of AED were scored daily using established criteria ( Schlereth et al . , 2012 ) . Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation for tissue collection . Induction of GVHD was based on an established T-dependent , MHC-matched unrelated donor model ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , C3-SW . H2b mice were lethally irradiated ( 10 . 5 Gy , Cs-137 ) and reconstituted with 5 × 106 T cell-depleted bone marrow ( TCD-BM ) cells from allogeneic C57BL/6 ( H2b ) mice . T cell depletion was achieved using BD anti-mouse CD90 . 2 IMag particles ( Cat . # 551518 , San Jose , CA ) . Control groups received TCD-BM only , but GVHD onset required reconstitution with TCD-BM and T cells . T cells were isolated from B6 splenocytes using immunomagnetic microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec , San Diego , CA ) targeting CD4 ( Cat . #130-049-201 ) , CD8 ( Cat . #130-116-478 ) , or CD90 . 2 ( Cat . #130-049-101 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell purity was evaluated by flow cytometry ( ~80% ) and adjusted such that 1 . 3 × 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or 2 . 3 × 106 CD3+ T cells were injected into each recipient with TCD-BM . Irradiated animals received water containing gentamicin ( 6 . 6 μg/ml ) for ten days following irradiation ( Henry Schein Animal Health , Dublin , OH ) . Supplical nutritional paste ( Henry Schein ) was also provided ad libitum to reduce weight loss . Systemic manifestations of GVHD were scored using established criteria ( Perez et al . , 2016 ) and ocular disease scored according to Table 2 . Corneal mechano-sensory function was measured on non-anesthetized mice with a Luneau Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer ( Western Ophthalmics , Lynwood , WA ) in 0 . 5 cm increments on a scale of 0 to 6 cm as previously described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Sensation scores reflect the longest filament length capable of eliciting replicate blink reflexes when applied to the central cornea . A Bioptigen spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SD-OCT ) system ( Leica Microsystems , Buffalo Grove , IL ) was utilized to evaluate corneal inflammation and edema in vivo ( Downie et al . , 2014 ) . Digital photography of the external eye was captured with a Leica MZ16 FA stereomicroscope . Corneal nerves were imaged in flat-mounted corneal buttons as described ( Chucair-Elliott et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , corneas were harvested with the limbus intact , fixed , permeabilized , and labeled with Abcam anti-mouse beta-III tubulin primary antibody ( Cat . # ab18207 , Cambridge , MA ) and a corresponding AlexaFluor647-conjugated secondary antibody ( Cat . # 711-605-152 , Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) . Corneas were also labeled with an eBioscience FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD3ε antibody ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) . Slides were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview1200 laser scanning confocal ( Center Valley , PA ) or a Nikon AR1 HD resonant scanning confocal ( Melville , NY ) microscope with sequential channel scanning . Confocal z-stack images were evaluated using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Concord , MA ) to quantify corneal nerves densities and the total numbers of CD3+ cells . Briefly , images were displayed as maximum intensity projections . Nerve volume per field of view was measured with the ‘create surface tool’ with manual thresholding for voxel area coverage of βIII tubulin+ fibers ( default parameters; smooth surface area detail set to 0 . 5 μm; background subtraction set to 8 . 0 μm ) . Total CD3+ cells were quantified using the spots tool with default parameters , an estimated cell diameter of 8 μm , and classification using the quality filter method with manual thresholding . Morphometric nerve volume and cell count summary statistics were reported by the software per image ( 20x field of view ) . Nerve densities were normalized to the respective control group average . Secondary lymphoid organs were harvested and mechanically processed into single-cell suspensions ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Blood was collected from the facial vein and treated with erythrocyte lysis buffer prior to labeling . Corneas were digested in RPMI1640 media containing 0 . 26 Wünsch units of Roche LiberaseTL enzyme blend ( Sigma Aldrich ) at 37° C as described ( Royer et al . , 2017 ) . Cell suspensions were filtered and labeled with Fc block and fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies ( eBioscience ) . In vitro T cell functional assays were performed as previously described ( Royer et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , cells were stimulated using 50 ng PMA and 800 ng ionomycin for three hours and monensin added after one hour ( BD Biosciences ) . Intracellular IFNγ expression was evaluated by flow cytometry using a BD cytofix/cytoperm staining kit . Samples were analyzed on a Miltenyi Biotec MacsQuant10 or a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer with MacsQuantify or FacsDiva software , respectively . For downstream gene expression studies , cornea digests were fractionated with Miltenyi microbeads by sequentially targeting CD45 ( Cat . # 130-052-301 ) and EpCAM ( Cat . # 130-105-958 ) as described ( Royer et al . , 2018 ) . Alternatively , GFP-expressing cells were purified or depleted using a BioRad S3e cell sorter . Tissues were harvested and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) containing 1x Calbiochem protease inhibitor cocktail ( Millipore Sigma ) . Serum was obtained by collecting blood from the facial vein into BD microtainer serum separator tubes . Tissue homogenates and serum were clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000×g . Chemokine concentrations were determined using a BioRad Luminex system and Millipore Milliplex MAP technology . Concentrations of C3 were measured by ELISA ( Abcam , Cat . # ab157711 ) . Gene expression studies were performed using RNA isolated from tissue and cells using the Trizol ( ThermoFisher ) method and converted to cDNA with iScript ( BioRad ) . Real-time PCR was performed using PrimePCR technology with commercially validated primer sequences ( Biorad ) and a Biorad CFX-Connect thermocycler as directed . Relative expression was calculated using the 2–ΔΔCt method with GAPDH ( glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ) as a reference gene . Final PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and imaged with an Azure Biosystems C-series gel documentation system ( Dublin , CA ) to confirm C3 expression in cell subsets . All data were evaluated using Prism six software ( GraphPad , San Diego , CA ) . Statistical tests and post hoc analyses utilized are listed in each figure legend .

         "Most people have likely experienced the discomfort of an eyelash falling onto the surface of their eye . Or that gritty sensation when dust blows into the eye and irritates the surface . These sensations are warnings from sensory nerves in the cornea , the transparent tissue that covers the iris and pupil . Corneal nerves help regulate blinking , and control production of the tear fluid that protects and lubricates the eye . But if the cornea suffers damage or infection , it can become inflamed . Long-lasting inflammation can damage the corneal nerves , leading to pain and vision loss . If scientists can identify how this happens , they may ultimately be able to prevent it . To this end , Royer et al . have used mice to study three causes of hard-to-treat corneal inflammation . The first is infection with herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) , which also causes cold sores . The second is eye allergy , where the immune system overreacts to substances like pollen or pet dander . And the third is graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , an immune disorder that can affect people who receive a bone marrow transplant . Royer et al . showed that HSV-1 infection and GVHD – but not allergies – made the mouse cornea less sensitive to touch . Consistent with this , microscopy revealed damage to corneal nerves in the mice with HSV-1 infection and those with GVHD . Further experiments showed that immune cells called CD4 T cells and a protein called complement C3 were contributing to this nerve damage . Treating the mice with an experimental drug derived from cobra venom protected the cornea from the harmful effects of inflammation . It did so by blocking activation of complement C3 at the eye surface . Identifying factors such as complement C3 that are responsible for corneal nerve damage is an important first step in helping patients with inflammatory eye diseases . Many drugs that target the complement pathway are currently under development . Some of these drugs could potentially be adapted for delivery as eye drops . But first , experiments must test whether complement also contributes to corneal nerve damage in humans . If it does , work can then begin on testing these drugs for safety and efficacy in patients .",

         "We addressed this important question in a mouse model of ocular HSV-1 infection , where sensory nerve damage is a common clinical problem . However , proper regulation of complement activation is necessary to balance immune responses and prevent collateral tissue damage  . Nonetheless , emerging concepts centering on complement effector synthesis within inflamed tissue microenvironments have ushered in a ‘renaissance’ of novel complement-targeted drug development strategies  . Furthermore , corneal nerves are increasingly recognized as central regulators of immune privilege at the ocular surface  . Corneal nerves originate predominantly from the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal ganglion  , and these peripheral nerves provide the cornea with the highest density of sensory fibers in the human body . To this end , we evaluated corneal nerve integrity and mechano-sensory function using a murine model of ocular HSV-1 infection to test the hypothesis that local complement activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage . To further qualify the possible role of complement in corneal nerve damage independent of infection , we evaluated corneal mechanosensory function in two noninfectious T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . The translational relevance of this study is underscored by in vivo confocal microscopy data from multiple clinical studies showing architectural changes in the corneal nerves of patients with herpetic keratitis , chronic ocular allergy , and ocular GVHD  . Adaptive immunity has been shown to prevent recovery of corneal sensory function following ocular HSV-1 infection  , but the initial pathophysiological triggers of denervation and sensation loss are not definitively characterized . Progressive loss of corneal mechano-sensitivity was evident in WT mice by days 5 to 8 p . Viral titers were measured at time points before and after the onset of corneal sensation loss to determine whether the divergence in sensation stemmed from a differential susceptibility to infection . Corneal buttons from WT mice exhibited extensive denervation with CD3+ T cell infiltration at day 8 p . However , T cell infiltration was observed without widespread denervation in C3-/- corneas  . The number of cornea-infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were similar among WT and C3-/- mice  . Although T cells successfully extravasate into the corneas of WT and C3-/- mice  , C3-deficiency can have broad impacts on T cell priming , clonal expansion , and recruitment  . To investigate this possibility , corneas from HSV-1-infected WT and C3-/- mice were evaluated for chemokines associated with T cell recruitment , and the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes  were harvested to evaluate T cell responses . Chemokines associated with T cell recruitment were elevated in corneas from both WT and C3-/- mice at day 5 p . Moreover , CD4+ and CD8+ T cell expansion was comparable within the eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes  from WT and C3-/- mice  . Collectively , these data show that C3-/- T cells exhibit normal expansion and recruitment to the cornea during ocular HSV-1 infection . In support of our hypothesis that C3 and T cells jointly coordinate corneal sensation loss , frank corneal sensation loss was not observed following ocular HSV-1 infection in C3-sufficient , alpha-beta T cell receptor-deficient mice  which congenitally lack classical CD4+ and CD8+ T cells  . Adoptive transfer of CD3+ T cells from either WT or C3-/- donors evoked progressive corneal sensation loss in TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . These findings further corroborate that C3-/- T cells remain functional in vivo . However , engraftment of donor cells was confirmed by analysis of T cells in the eye-draining MLN of recipient mice by flow cytometry at day 8 p . An increase in total cell number was observed for CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells upon adoptive transfer of purified CD3+ T cells into TCRα-/- recipient mice  . Consistent with this observation , our data show that transfer of CD3+ T cells from HSV-infected mice have no appreciable impact on HSV-1 titers in the TG of TCRα-/- recipients by day 8 p . Our collective findings reveal that C3 and T cells are individually necessary and interdependent in the pathogenesis of HSV-1-associated corneal sensation loss . Whether by direct or indirect mechanisms , these data support a paradigm in which C3 activation and T cell engagement coordinate corneal nerve damage in herpetic keratitis . Our data show that T cells contribute to corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection , yet whether this pathology is dependent upon CD4+ or CD8+ T cells remained unclear . To better discern the contributions of each subset , CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were harvested from infected WT mice , transferred into separate groups of TCRα-/- mice , and recipient mice subsequently infected with HSV-1 . Corneal sensation loss during acute HSV-1 infection was only observed upon reconstitution with CD4+ T cells  . Donor cell engraftment was confirmed by flow cytometry , although a statistically significant increase in cell number within the eye-draining MLN was only observed upon transfer of CD4+ T cells  . Transgenic OT-II mice did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following infection despite evidence of bystander CD4+ T cell activation and recruitment into the cornea  . Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells from HSV-infected WT and OT-II mice into TCRα-/- recipients corroborated these findings  . Nonetheless , active corneal HSV-1 infection was necessary to provoke corneal sensation loss , as TCRα-/- mice reconstituted with CD4+ T cells harvested from HSV-infected WT mice did not elicit auto/allo-antigen-associated sensation loss within two weeks of corneal scratch injury   . Collectively , our data show that complement C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells are simultaneously necessary to drive corneal sensation loss during HSV-1 infection . These results strongly portend that a coordinated inflammatory axis exists involving C3 and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells , and that it is responsible for sensory neuropathy in herpetic keratitis . While local complement activation and regulation have been reported in the cornea in health and disease  , the expression profile and cellular sources of various complement components have not been investigated in the context of ocular HSV-1 infection . Constitutive expression of complement receptor 2  has been reported in the corneal epithelium  , but variances in its expression during HSV-1 infection were not statistically significant across the time points evaluated  . Likewise , no differences in the local expression of various complement regulators were observed in HSV-infected corneas aside from the C1-inhibitor SerpinG1  . Monocytes and tissue macrophages are known sources of C3  , thus CSF1R+ cells from the peripheral blood of transgenic CSF1R-GFP mice  were utilized as the relative standard for C3 transcript expression . In addition , isolated EpCAM+ corneal epithelial cells expressed C3 at levels comparable to blood monocytes . However , the C3 expression level was greater in whole-cornea preparations than among individual cell fractions  . Taken together , our data show that both tissue-resident non-hematopoietic cells and resident/infiltrating CSF1R+ leukocytes contribute to local C3 expression in the cornea during acute HSV-1 infection . Ocular HSV-1 infection amplifies local complement gene expression , yet whether local control of complement activation can be harnessed to prevent corneal nerve damage has not been explored . Protein levels of C3 remained near baseline in the cornea following CVF treatment during HSV-1 infection , yet vehicle-treated animals exhibited a 300–600% increase in C3 protein levels in the cornea at days 3 and 7 p . Ocular CVF treatment did not significantly impact systemic serum C3 concentrations throughout the study  . , no difference in total CD45+ or CSF1R+ cells were observed in the cornea , yet there was a reduction in the total number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells  . , HSV-1 titers were similar in the corneas and TG comparing vehicle- and CVF-treated animals  . However , CVF treatment did not have any discernable impact on T cell expansion in the eye-draining MLN or the total number of circulating CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells in HSV-1 infected animals  . To this end , corneal sensation was measured independent of infection in two T cell-dependent ocular surface inflammatory diseases . Murine models of allergic eye disease  and ocular graft-versus-host disease  were employed to further delineate the hypothesized role of T cells in coordinating corneal nerve damage  . First , AED was induced using an established systemic ovalbumin  -sensitization and ocular challenge model  mimicking aspects of chronic keratoconjunctivitis  . Consistent with development of AED , corneas from OVA-challenged mice exhibited CD3+ T cell infiltration by challenge day 7  . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the preservation of corneal nerve density during AED  , although CD3+ T cell numbers were elevated in sensitized animals relative to healthy controls  . Flow cytometry was used to verify that the cornea-infiltrating T cells were predominately CD4+ in the AED model  . Although clinical data show that corneal nerve remodeling can occur in patients with chronic ocular allergy  , allergy symptoms were not accompanied by frank loss of corneal mechano-sensation in the AED animal model . Corneal sensation was also evaluated in a T cell-dependent allogeneic model of chronic GVHD with systemic and ocular manifestations following hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation  . This minor histocompatibility antigen mismatch model was established by transferring HSC-rich bone marrow  and purified T cells from C57BL/6  donors into lethally irradiated sex-matched C3 . Recipient controls that receive BM without T cells recover and do not develop GVHD  . Onset of GVHD was established by transfer of BM with CD4+ T cells only , CD8+ T cells only , or both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . Progressive corneal sensation loss was observed following transfer of CD4+ T cells with and without addition of CD8+ T cells . Consistent with sensation loss , corneal nerve integrity was markedly reduced in groups receiving CD4+ T cells  . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks confirmed the CD4-dependent decrease in corneal nerve density  and concomitant increase in total CD3+ cells  . Taken together , our data show for the first time that corneal sensation loss occurs early in ocular GVHD and that this pathology is instigated in part by allogeneic CD4+ T cells . The pharmacologic impact of local CVF treatment on ocular GVHD progression was consequently explored in order to identify whether the CD4+ T cell-associated corneal sensation loss observed in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GVHD shared a common C3-codependent pathomechanism . Although CVF administration was limited to the eye , systemic serum C3 concentrations were lower in the GVHD cohort treated with CVF compared to the PBS-treated GVHD groups at the study endpoint . Nonetheless , the inverted CD4:CD8 T cell ratio  in the spleens and eye-draining mandibular lymph nodes of both groups of GVHD mice confirmed the presence of systemic disease  . Morphometric analysis of confocal image stacks from the study endpoint corroborated the preservation of corneal nerve density in CVF-treated mice from the GVHD cohort  , although CVF did not reduce the number of total CD3+ cells during GVHD relative to PBS  . In summary , these preclinical models establish that CD4+ T cells and complement C3 coordinate corneal sensory nerve damage in both herpetic keratitis and ocular GHVD . Moreover , our data provide a proof of principle that complement-targeted therapeutics may limit the severity of immune-mediated sensory nerve damage at the ocular surface . Complement-targeted drug development for ophthalmic use has almost exclusively focused on AMD with some interest in neuromyelitis optica  , Stargardt disease , and autoimmune uveitis  . Nonetheless , the complement pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of several ocular surface diseases  . While corneal nerves are increasingly implicated in maintenance of corneal immune privilege  , this study is the first to identify that C3 is involved in the pathobiology of corneal sensory nerve damage . Lessons from peripheral nerve injury in other settings indicate that some damaged nerves undergo apoptosis , yet effectively promoting functional regeneration of surviving neurons remains a major clinical hurtle  . The lack of a sensory phenotype in the AED model was unanticipated in light of evidence that patients with severe allergy exhibit changes in corneal nerve morphology  . In addition to loss of mechano-sensory function , corneal nerve pathologies can involve a broad array of neuropathic clinical symptoms including dryness , itch , and pain  . Future studies are needed to broaden the scope of these observations to other peripheral nerve diseases . Complement enhances clearance of infected cells and nascent virions during HSV-1 infection  . Importantly , HSV-1 can also evade C3 activation through endogenous expression of glycoprotein C  . By limiting C3b deposition on infected cells and nascent virions , gC can inhibit subsequent C5 binding and membrane attack complex  formation  . However , this gC-mediated viral evasion strategy may also be cell type-dependent . Cell culture modeling indicates that neuronal cells maintain host-encoded complement regulator expression more efficiently and are more resistant to MAC deposition than epithelial cells upon HSV-1 infection  . This is consistent with our data showing that immunologically naive C3-/- mice maintain corneal sensation and innervation , yet they exhibit concomitant enhancement of viral shedding in the tear film and increased viral burden in the TG by day 7 p . The absence of a concordant difference in HSV-1 titers in corneas from WT and C3-/- mice is likely explained by the potent antiviral effects of type-1 interferon  . Taken together , this evidence indicates that although C3 is involved in progression of keratitis and sensory nerve fiber retraction during acute infection , it likely does not contribute to complete elimination of infected nerves . Furthermore , we have recently reported that C3 is essential for optimal antibody-dependent viral clearance following ocular HSV-1 challenge in mice  . While vaccinated animals did not exhibit corneal sensation loss following ocular HSV-1 infection in those studies , deposition of the terminal C3 cleavage product C3d was present in the corneal epithelium  . Host gene expression data herein corroborates that HSV-1 infection creates an imbalance in the local complement effector to regulator expression ratios that contribute to aberrant complement pathway activation in the cornea . Identification of the complement pathway’s role in initiating corneal sensation loss following HSV-1 infection is an important advancement in the mechanistic understanding of this disease process , as it introduces an array of potential drug targets for local therapy . Our data corroborate findings from the Hendricks’ lab showing that CD4 T cells are associated with corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 keratitis  , yet our adoptive transfer experiments establish that this process is not dependent upon endogenous C3 production by cornea-infiltrating donor T cells  . This likely reflects the relative lymphopenic status of T cell-reconstituted TCRα-/- mice compared to WT mice  . Corneal sensation loss in HSV-1 infection and ocular GVHD shared a common mechanism dependent upon CD4+ T cells and complement C3 . The role of intracellular C3 in regulating human Th1 responses has received much attention in recent years  . Such studies involve CD3 and CD46 stimulation to activate human CD4 T cells in vitro . Instead , anaphylatoxin receptor signaling has been shown to modulate Th1 cytokine production in murine T cells  . Our ex vivo re-stimulation data clearly show that there is no defect in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice following HSV-1 infection . Others have shown similar data based on T cell proliferation in response to re-stimulation with HSV-1 antigen  . In contrast , a reduction in IFNγ production by CD4 T cells from C3-/- mice was reported following in vitro expansion under Th1 polarizing conditions  . Nonetheless , it is possible that anaphylatoxin receptor signaling from locally produced C3a  modulates T cell effector function upon extravasation into the inflamed cornea . The precise relationships between T cells and C3 in our mouse models of corneal neuropathic disease remain to be identified . Our working hypothesis involves an indirect mechanism whereby sublytic MAC deposition from local complement activation damages sensory nerves , which are then cleared by T cell-activated phagocytes or other cytolytic cells . These could include tissue-resident and infiltrating leukocytes  as well as nerve-associated corneal epithelial cells  . In light of this , it is plausible that complement-mediated damage to corneal epithelial cells has a direct impact on sensory nerves . Although corneal nerve damage is an established pathology in animal models of HSV-1 infection  , this is the first report documenting loss of corneal mechano-sensory function in ocular GVHD . Corneal sensation loss may provide a clinical benchmark for initiation of targeted therapies to curb progression of ocular GVHD in patients . Published imaging studies confirm that corneal nerve remodeling occurs in patients with ocular GVHD  ; therefore , clinical studies to delineate the kinetics of disease onset are needed . Complement C3 is a known driver of systemic GVHD  , and our data show that aberrant complement pathway activation also contributes to the pathogenesis of ocular GVHD including corneal sensation loss . Furthermore , complement activity is reportedly limited by terminal pathway components in female mice compared to males  . Collectively , our data suggest that sensory nerve involvement may be a unique facet and treatment target in ocular GVHD . Accordingly , we used CVF to target complement activation in models of HSV-1 keratitis and ocular GVHD as a proof of concept for local delivery of complement-targeted therapeutics for ocular surface disease . In our hands , respiratory distress was observed in some mice following the initial sub-conjunctival CVF injection irrespective of group assignment  . Experimental CVF administration was once thought to directly stimulate T cells , but such effects were later attributed to mitogen contamination  . Because our disease models were T cell-dependent , we utilized highly-purified CVF from a commercial source for our studies . Moreover , we found no evidence to suggest that CVF impacted T cell responses outside of the eye . Local CVF treatment reduced corneal T cell infiltration following HSV-1 infection  . However , we have not excluded the possibility that CVF treatment may delay the tempo of T cell influx . By addressing the ‘heart’ of the complement pathway  , this study opens the door to future investigation to further elucidate the relevant pathomechanisms and corresponding therapeutic targets . Low-level complement turnover is observed in healthy corneas/tears , and complement may even contribute to the relative ‘paucibacterial’ state of the ocular surface microbiome  . Animal models are necessary for mechanistic studies when it comes to understanding complement pathway regulation , especially in dynamic tissue microenvironments; however , differences in complement regulation exist between mouse and man that will also have to be resolved to further assess the translational potential  . Even among individual patients , small nucleotide polymorphisms evoke changes in complement activity that have major impacts on disease risks . Accordingly , complotype differences may help explain differential susceptibility patterns in a variety of ocular surface diseases . Our data herein have demonstrated successful prophylactic intervention in repressing complement-mediated sensory nerve pathology in two well characterized experimental T cell-dependent corneal disease models . Other avenues of future investigation are also needed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic intervention on established ocular surface diseases . Successful implementation of complement-targeted therapeutics for topical ophthalmic use may provide the benefit of controlling insidious ocular surface diseases without the risks associated with systemic therapies . Research was performed in accordance with protocols approved by respective institutional animal care and use committees . Viral stocks were propagated and infectious titers quantified by standard plaque assay on Vero cells  as previously reported  . For adoptive transfers , T cells were purified from splenocyte preparations using a BioRad S3e cell sorter  . Induction of GVHD was based on an established T-dependent , MHC-matched unrelated donor model  . T cell depletion was achieved using BD anti-mouse CD90 . Control groups received TCD-BM only , but GVHD onset required reconstitution with TCD-BM and T cells . T cells were isolated from B6 splenocytes using immunomagnetic microbeads  targeting CD4  , CD8  , or CD90 . 3 × 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells or 2 . 3 × 106 CD3+ T cells were injected into each recipient with TCD-BM . Corneal mechano-sensory function was measured on non-anesthetized mice with a Luneau Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer  in 0 . Briefly , corneas were harvested with the limbus intact , fixed , permeabilized , and labeled with Abcam anti-mouse beta-III tubulin primary antibody  and a corresponding AlexaFluor647-conjugated secondary antibody  .

         "Variation in the presentation of hereditary immunodeficiencies may be explained by genetic or environmental factors . Patients with mutations in HOIL1 ( RBCK1 ) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency . We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation . However , they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii or Citrobacter rodentium . Increased susceptibility to Listeria was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines . In contrast , HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis or murine γ-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) , and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype . Surprisingly , chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1 , IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following Listeria infection . Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice , highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies .\nHOIL-1 ( encoded by the RBCK1 gene ) , HOIP ( RNF31 ) and SHARPIN form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex ( LUBAC ) , which linearly ubiquitinates receptor signaling complex components such as NEMO to enhance NF-κB activation after engagement of immune receptors including TNF-R1 , IL-1R , CD40 , TLRs and NOD2 ( Tokunaga et al . , 2011; Tokunaga et al . , 2009; Ikeda et al . , 2011; Gerlach et al . , 2011; Haas et al . , 2009; Zak et al . , 2011; Hostager et al . , 2011; Boisson et al . , 2012; Damgaard et al . , 2012; Tian et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , HOIL-1/LUBAC was also shown to be important for activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in macrophages via linear ubiquitination of ASC ( Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) . These data suggest that HOIL-1 plays multiple roles in inflammation and infection . In mice , SHARPIN deficiency results in auto-inflammation involving multiple organs including the liver , esophagus , lung and , most noticeably , chronic proliferative dermatitis of the skin ( Seymour et al . , 2007 ) . The development and organization of secondary lymphoid organs and antibody isotype switching are also impaired in these mice ( HogenEsch et al . , 1999 ) . Loss of HOIP catalytic activity in B cells results in the impaired development of B1 B cells and antibody responses to antigen ( Sasaki et al . , 2013 ) . However , HOIL-1-deficient mice have not been analyzed extensively to date . Sixteen patients with bi-allelic mutations in the gene encoding HOIL-1 have been reported ( Boisson et al . , 2012; Nilsson et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Three patients exhibited cardiomyopathy , amylopectinosis , hyper-inflammation and mild immunodeficiency associated with an increased frequency of bacterial infections , whereas other patients presented with amylopectinosis and myopathy alone ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The role of HOIL-1 in inflammation and immunity to infection in vivo is , therefore , uncertain . Although there are multiple possible explanations for the variable clinical presentations of the reported patients including hypomorphic expression of HOIL-1 or effects of mutations on protein function , another possibility was that environmental factors alter the clinical presentation of HOIL-1 deficiency . In this study we define the function of HOIL-1 in murine immunity to infection and explore the potential role of the virome in determining HOIL-1 deficiency-associated phenotypes . The bacterial microbiome and the virome regulate inflammation and immunity ( Virgin , 2014; Virgin et al . , 2009; Belkaid and Hand , 2014 ) . Within the virome , herpesviruses persistently infect most humans , and exert significant effects on innate immunity in mice during experimental chronic infection , including increasing resistance to tumors and a range of pathogens ( Barton et al . , 2007; White et al . , 2010; Yager et al . , 2009; Nguyen et al . , 2008; Haque et al . , 2004 ) . However , the potential effects of chronic infection on the phenotypic manifestations of immune deficiencies have not been considered . In this study , we show that chronic herpesvirus infection can alter the presentation of several genetic immunodeficiencies in mice . We first found that , in naïve mice , HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii and Citrobacter rodentium and for efficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to be essential for resistance to lethal infection by hematopoietic cells during Listeria infection . In contrast , HOIL-1 knock-out ( KO ) mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , were resistant to infection with murine γ-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although HOIL-1 KO mice raised in a barrier facility did not display signs of auto-inflammation , chronic infection with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis resulted in elevated inflammatory cytokines circulating in the serum , similar to that observed in some patients with mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) . Interestingly , latent infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 deficient mice from lethality during Listeria infection and induced high levels of the protective cytokine , interferon-gamma ( IFNγ ) . MHV68 latency also protected IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11 deficient mice from Listeria-induced lethality , indicating that the ability of latent infection to complement a genetic immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutation of Hoil-1 . These data indicate that chronic infections can modify the clinical presentations of genetic variations , thereby opening a new avenue for the analysis and interpretation of human genotype-phenotype association studies . We speculate that the protective effect of chronic herpesvirus infection is due to the stimulation of the function of the innate immune system in a manner that compensates for deficient early cytokine responses associated with multiple immunodeficiencies .\nHOIL-1 KO mice ( Tokunaga et al . , 2009 ) were born at Mendelian ratios and , in contrast to SHARPIN-deficient mice , failed to develop TNFα-driven inflammatory skin disease ( Ikeda et al . , 2011; Gerlach et al . , 2011; Tokunaga et al . , 2011; Tokunaga and Iwai , 2012 ) and exhibited normal histology of lymphoid organs , liver , lung , and kidney , and the presence of Peyer's patches along the small intestine ( not shown ) . Aged HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited deposits of material that stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and was resistant to digestion with diastase , similar to the amylopectin-like material observed in humans with HOIL-1 deficiency ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . Importantly , these barrier-raised mice showed minimal signs of baseline hyper-inflammation . In this regard , HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited normal numbers of lymphoid and myeloid cells in the spleen and thymus , normal complete blood counts ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A , B , D ) , and no detectable increase of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) or interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) in serum ( discussed below ) . However , in the peritoneum , HOIL-1 KO mice contained about twofold more B cells , T cells and resident macrophages without changes in other cell types ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) . Expression of neighboring genes , Trib3 and Tbc1d20 , was unaffected by disruption of the Rbck1 ( Hoil1 ) gene ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . To determine the requirement for HOIL-1 during the immune response to infection in vivo , we challenged HOIL-1 KO mice with a number of different pathogens . Strikingly , HOIL-1 KO mice were highly susceptible to even low dose infection with the facultative gram-positive intracellular bacterium , Listeria monocytogenes ( Listeria ) , with 80% , 80% and 50% of mice succumbing to infection within 10 days of intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) inoculation with 105 , 104 and 103 CFU , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Although bacterial burdens in the spleens and livers of control and HOIL-1 KO mice were similar 1 and 3 days post-infection with 105 CFU , bacterial CFUs were elevated in HOIL-1 KO mice by 6 days post-infection , indicating that HOIL-1 KO mice were unable to control and clear the bacteria ( Figure 1B ) . Further , these mutant mice developed large inflammatory lesions in the liver , elevated liver enzymes in the serum , and widespread tissue destruction in the spleen ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 , not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 006Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 011 HOIL-1 KO mice were also highly susceptible to infection with a relatively avirulent type II strain of the intracellular apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii ( T . gondii ) ( Figure 1C ) . Despite infection with 5000 parasites resulting in lethality in only 20% of control mice , 100 parasites was sufficient to induce lethality in 100% of HOIL-1 KO mice . Quantification of parasite-encoded luciferase expression in vivo revealed that HOIL-1 KO mice failed to control T . gondii replication by 8 days post-infection ( Figure 1D ) . HOIL-1 KO mice also succumbed to infection with the enteric gram-negative pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , whereas control mice were highly resistant ( Figure 1E , F ) . These data indicated that loss of HOIL-1 expression confers profound immunodeficiency in barrier-raised mice . To define the role of HOIL-1 in immunity , we examined the response to Listeria in more detail . One patient with HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency showed signs of recovery from hyper-inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . In mice , reciprocal bone marrow transplantation revealed that expression of HOIL-1 in radiation-sensitive hematopoietic cells was critical for resistance to Listeria ( Figure 2A , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We noted that control mice that received control bone marrow were slightly more susceptible to infection than non-irradiated control mice ( compare with Figure 1A ) , suggesting that reconstitution does not fully restore the immune system of a lethally irradiated mouse to that of a non-irradiated animal . Despite this caveat , irradiated wild-type control mice that received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow and were challenged with 105 Listeria 8 weeks later succumbed to infection at the same rate as HOIL-1 KO mice that had received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow . HOIL-1 KO mice that received control bone marrow had an increased survival rate , but still succumbed more readily than control mice that received control bone marrow . These data indicate that , while HOIL-1 expression is essential in bone marrow-derived cells , HOIL-1 may also play a role in radiation resistant cells during Listeria infection . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 012Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 014 To determine whether HOIL-1 deficiency resulted in a defect in innate or adaptive immunity , we bred the HOIL-1 KO mice onto a RAG1-deficient background . T and B cell-deficient RAG1 HOIL-1 double KO mice succumbed to infection significantly faster than RAG1 KO mice ( Figure 2B ) , and exhibited elevated bacterial burden in the spleen and liver 3 days post-infection ( Figure 2C ) , indicating that HOIL-1 plays an essential role in innate immunity during Listeria infection . Indeed , HOIL-1-deficient mice succumbed to infection at the same rate regardless of the presence or absence of the adaptive immune system ( compare Figures 1A and 2B ) . Further , HOIL-1 KO mice immunized with a low dose of Listeria were capable of mounting a protective adaptive response to a high dose secondary challenge with Listeria 28 days later ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . We noted that 1000 CFU administered i . p . was a borderline dose required to successfully immunize control mice in our experiments , despite being sufficient to induce lethality in 50% of HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 1A ) . Together , these data do not rule out a role for HOIL-1 in adaptive immunity , but show that HOIL-1 plays a major role in hematopoietic cells to foster innate immunity to Listeria infection . Innate immunity to Listeria in mice depends on tissue-resident macrophages and CD8α+ dendritic cells responding to Listeria infection by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNFα , IL-12 , and IL-6 . These cytokines are each well recognized to be essential for survival after Listeria infection ( Unanue , 1997; Williams et al . , 2012 ) through their role in coordinating activation of NK cells , NKT cell and T cells to produce IFNγ required for the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells . Therefore , to further define a role for HOIL-1 in the innate immune system , we determined whether HOIL-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages ( macrophages herein ) produced cytokines in response to Listeria infection with or without IFNγ treatment . Compared to control cells , HOIL-1 KO macrophages secreted only 50% , 20% and 10% of the expected levels of TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12p70 protein , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Consistent with a role for HOIL-1 in the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor following TLR stimulation , Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO macrophages expressed decreased levels of Tnf , Il6 and Il12b mRNA ( Figure 3B ) . The defects in cytokine transcript levels were of smaller magnitude than the decreases in secreted protein , particularly for Tnf , suggesting that HOIL-1 may also be involved in cytokine translation or secretion . However , HOIL-1 KO macrophages killed Listeria after activation with IFNγ as effectively as control cells , indicating the selectivity of HOIL-1 effects on macrophage function ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 015Figure 3 .

Each symbol represents an individual mouse . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 018 We confirmed that induction of Tnf and Il6 mRNA was significantly impaired following Listeria infection in vivo by measuring cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from mice 3 to 12 hr after infection ( Figure 3C ) . This reduction in cytokine transcripts could not be explained by a decrease in macrophage numbers ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Surprisingly , Il12b transcript levels were similar in HOIL-1 KO mice , with a significant difference being detected at only 6 hr after infection . Similar decreases in Tnf and Il6 mRNA were observed in mice on the Rag1−/− background at 3 hr post-infection , confirming that these differences are due to a defect in innate immunity in the absence of HOIL-1 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . We also noted that fewer NK cells and neutrophils were present in the peritoneum 6 hr after Listeria infection , suggesting delayed recruitment or proliferation of these cell types ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . These decreases in cytokine production and delayed cell recruitment likely synergize with defects in IL-1β and TNFα signaling observed by others ( Tian et al . , 2007; Haas et al . , 2009; Tokunaga et al . , 2009 , 2011 ) to compromise antibacterial immunity , and may contribute to the impaired induction of Ifng mRNA observed by 12 hr ( Figure 3C ) . These data indicate that HOIL-1 plays a critical role in coordinating essential early cytokine responses after Listeria infection . The above data demonstrate that HOIL-1 KO mice have a severe immunodeficiency after certain types of infection . To assess the generality of this phenotype we infected HOIL-1 KO mice with murine γ-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68 ) , a genetic relative of the common persistent human herpesviruses , Epstein–Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( EBV , KSHV ) ( Barton et al . , 2011; Speck and Ganem , 2010 ) . HOIL-1 KO mice survived MHV68 infection for at least 3 months . MHV68 replication was unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency in cultured macrophages , and was suppressed only slightly in vivo ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Despite normal establishment of latency as determined by the number of cells carrying MHV68 genome 28 days after infection ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , the efficiency of MHV68 reactivation from latency in explanted peritoneal cells was significantly impaired ( approximately 50-fold , Figure 4A ) . Similarly , HOIL-1 KO mice failed to succumb to infection with M . tuberculosis over 70 days of infection , and in fact exhibited lower bacterial colony counts in the spleen while counts in the lung were no different than controls ( Figure 4B ) . Thus HOIL-1 KO mice are fully able to control , and may have an enhanced ability to control , specific aspects of acute and chronic MHV68 and M . tuberculosis infection , in striking contrast to the immunodeficiency apparent after infection with Listeria , Toxoplasma , and Citrobacter . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 003Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 005 The ability of HOIL-1 KO mice to effectively control chronic herpesvirus infection allowed us to test the hypothesis that persistent virus infection might alter two phenotypes , hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency , in which HOIL-1 KO mice appear to differ from some reported patients with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , patients with HOIL-1 deficiency and hyper-inflammation exhibited increased expression of IL-6 and TNFα in the serum and increased expression of mRNA for Il6 in blood cells ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore examined the serum of MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice for cytokines essential for resistance to Listeria but deficient in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . As previously observed ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , latent infection of control mice with MHV68 was associated with an increase in circulating levels of TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFNγ compared with uninfected mice ( Figure 4C ) . In HOIL-1 KO mice , MHV68 latently resulted in small but significant increases in TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels , and a more striking increase in IFNγ levels compared to latently infected controls . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with M . tuberculosis also exhibited increased expression of both IL-6 and TNFα in serum at 70 days post-infection ( Figure 4D ) . Therefore , there is an overlap between cytokines expressed in hyper-inflammatory patients and in chronically-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . MHV68 latency has been shown previously to induce symbiotic protection against Listeria infection in wild-type mice ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) . Because expression of TNFα , IL-6 and IFNγ are essential for control of Listeria infection in mice ( Kopf et al . , 1994; Unanue , 1997; Williams et al . , 2012 ) , and were impaired in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 3C ) , but elevated in MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice , we considered whether chronic MHV68 infection could complement the profound immunodeficiency observed in Listeria-infected barrier-raised HOIL-1 KO mice . As observed previously ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency , 1 month after infection , protected control mice from an otherwise lethal dose of Listeria ( Figure 5A ) . MHV68 latency also protected HOIL-1 KO mice from a dose of Listeria at least 1000-fold higher than the LD50 for MHV68-negative mice ( Figures 5A and 1A ) . Both control and HOIL-1 KO mice were still partially protected from Listeria challenge 6 months after MHV68 infection ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . A viral mutant capable of acute lytic infection but unable to efficiently establish latency ( ORF73 . stop ) ( Moorman et al . , 2003 ) was unable to efficiently protect HOIL-1 KO or control mice from Listeria infection , demonstrating that latent MHV68 is required to complement HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency to Listeria ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 019Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 04494 . 022 To determine whether MHV68 latency rescued pro-inflammatory cytokine induction by HOIL-1 KO mice following Listeria infection , we quantitated cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from latently infected mice before ( Figure 5C ) and 3 hr after ( Figure 5D ) infection with Listeria . As predicted from the cytokine levels in the serum , MHV68 latency resulted in small but significant increases in Tnf , Il6 and Il12b transcripts prior to Listeria challenge ( Figure 5C ) . While MHV68 latency did not rescue the induction of Tnf or Il6 transcripts in HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria , Il12b transcript levels were increased approximately twofold , and were comparable to levels in control mice . More significantly , Ifng and Nos2 ( encoding iNOS ) transcripts were elevated approximately 200-fold and 1000-fold , respectively , in latently infected control and HOIL-1 KO mice ( Figure 5C ) , and further induced by 3 hr after infection with Listeria ( Figure 5D ) . Ifng transcript levels were significantly higher in latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria than in control mice . These data suggest that MHV68 latency by-passes the requirement for TNFα and IL-6 during early Listeria infection by enhancing the induction of IFNγ and downstream effector molecules important for controlling Listeria infection . To test whether peritoneal macrophages from latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice had an increased capacity to kill Listeria , we explanted peritoneal macrophages from mock or latently infected mice , infected them with Listeria , killed extracellular bacteria with gentamycin treatment , and compared the number of CFU at 6 hr to the number of CFU at the beginning of the experiment . As expected , cells from mock infected control mice exhibited mild listericidal activity and cells from latently infected control mice had an enhanced ability to kill Listeria ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 , ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) ) . Macrophages from mock-infected HOIL-1 KO mice had a slightly impaired ability to control Listeria infection . However , MHV68 latency in HOIL-1 KO mice enhanced the ability of macrophages to kill Listeria , generating a capacity to kill similar to that observed with macrophages from control mice . Together , these data suggest that MHV68 latency induces an environment that enhances the ability of HOIL-1-deficient cells to kill and respond to Listeria . To determine whether the viral complementation of immunodeficiency was unique to HOIL-1 , we latently infected IL-6 , Caspase-1-deficient and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-double-deficient mice ( Kayagaki et al . , 2013 ) , which survive MHV68 infection but are all highly susceptible to Listeria infection ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) ( Kopf et al . , 1994; Sarawar et al . , 1998; Edelson and Unanue , 2002; Tsuji et al . , 2004; Sauer et al . , 2011 ) . IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice were also protected from lethality following Listeria infection by chronic MHV68 infection ( Figure 5E , F ) . These data indicate that the capacity of chronic MHV68 to reverse a significant immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutations in Rbck1 ( Hoil1 ) , and suggest that chronic viral infections may alter phenotypes of many host allelic variants .\nWe report that HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria , T . gondii and C . rodentium , but not with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis in mice . Expression of HOIL-1 was critical in innate , hematopoietic-derived cells during Listeria infection in vivo . The requirement of HOIL-1 for the induction of protective inflammatory cytokines , TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12 , following infection of macrophages with Listeria in vitro is consistent with reports that LUBAC is required for efficient NF-κB activation following TLR engagement ( Zak et al . , 2011; Boisson et al . , 2012 ) , but not with a recent report that NF-κB activation following stimulation of TLR4 and TNF-R1 on macrophages by LPS and TNFα , respectively , is unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency ( Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) . These apparently conflicting results suggest that HOIL-1 and LUBAC may not only have cell-type specific functions ( Boisson et al . , 2012; Rodgers et al . , 2014 ) , but also stimulus-specific roles that vary between different cell types . This may be further highlighted by the excessive inflammatory response and enhanced control of MHV68 and M . tuberculosis infection—two pathogens that also infect macrophages—by HOIL-1-deficient mice . It has been proposed that low levels of viral reactivation during MHV68 latency are responsible for the low level of constant immune activation and cytokine production ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) . It is paradoxical , then , that reactivation is almost undetectable in HOIL-1-deficient animals , and yet their inflammatory response is elevated . Since the negative regulator of NF-κB signaling , A20 , binds to linear ubiquitin chains ( Tokunaga et al . , 2012; Verhelst et al . , 2012 ) , HOIL-1/LUBAC may also be important for recruiting A20 to receptor signaling complexes to turn off signaling . Therefore , receptor signaling may be sustained in cells in HOIL-1 KO mice , resulting in the increase in TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12 , and ultimately IFNγ protein , observed in the serum of chronically infected mice . Decreased viral reactivation may be the result of this increased IFNγ , the inability of latently infected cells to response to a stimulus of reactivation or a combination thereof . It is unclear why HOIL-1 KO mice are extremely susceptible to some pathogens , yet control other infections remarkably well . This might be due to HOIL-1/LUBAC having differential roles in transducing signals from different immune sensors stimulated by different infections . Other possibilities include a differential requirement for the innate immune system to hold the acute infection in check while an adaptive response is being generated , the speed at which the pathogen replicates , the tissues that it damages , and whether pathology during acute infection is mostly immune- or pathogen-derived . Further studies will be required to address these possibilities . We further show that chronic infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 , IL-6 , Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice from lethal Listeria infection , thereby masking the genetic immunodeficiency observed in MHV68-negative mice . As reported previously ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFNγ in the serum of wild-type animals , which were further increased in HOIL-1 KO mice . These cytokines appear to increase the activation status of the innate immune system such that their induction following Listeria infection is no longer as important as would be the case in a naïve mouse . Indeed , MHV68 infection did not enhance the transcription of Tnf , and only marginally enhanced the transcription of Il6 and Il12b even in control mice following Listeria infection , and did not rescue the defect in Tnf and Il6 induction observed in HOIL-1 KO mice . Conversely , transcription of Ifng and the effector molecule , iNOS ( encoded by Nos2 ) , was elevated in cells from latently infected mice and enhanced substantially by both HOIL-1 KO and control animals very rapidly following infection with Listeria . Macrophages require priming with IFNγ to induce IL-12 in response to Listeria infection . In a latently infected animal , IFNγ is already present and so IL-12 and additional IFNγ may be induced more rapidly . Furthermore , as reported previously for wild-type mice ( Barton et al . , 2007 ) , MHV68 latency enhanced the ability of peritoneal macrophages from control and HOIL-1 KO mice to kill Listeria . Together , these data suggest that the constant presence of low levels of IFNγ driven by latent virus infection results in an increase in the basal expression levels of downstream effector molecules and the priming of cells for the enhanced immediate killing of Listeria upon infection , as well as for a more rapid further induction of IFNγ and its effector molecules in response to the bacterial challenge . In this sense , chronic virus infection sets the level of innate immunity to subsequent infection . HOIL-1 KO mice bred in a high grade barrier facility failed to exhibit certain phenotypes of HOIL-1 deficient patients , specifically by not exhibiting baseline hyper-inflammation and by displaying a striking immunodeficiency out of proportion to that observed in some humans with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1 ( HOIL1 ) . Most humans are infected life-long with multiple herpesviruses ( Virgin et al . , 2009; Virgin , 2014 ) , and many also carry other chronic or latent infections such as tuberculosis . Importantly , we observed complementation of immunodeficiency to Listeria by chronic herpesvirus infection in four different strains of immunodeficient mice , revealing virus infection as one possible environmental factor that might alter the genotype-phenotype relationship for patients with mutations in immune system genes . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with either a herpesvirus or M . tuberculosis also exhibited increases in some of the same cytokines reported in the serum of HOIL-1 deficient humans . At least three of the HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with at least one herpesvirus ( Boisson et al . , 2012 ) , and it is likely that other chronic infections were present . However , in the absence of data regarding the complete infection status of the HOIL-1 mutant patients , the relevance of the mouse studies to the human phenotypes is unclear . Nevertheless , perhaps the presence of the virome , and potentially variations in the virome or other chronic infections between people , confers significant phenotypic variation by complementing mutations in host genes responsible for innate immunity ( Virgin , 2014 ) . The genes involved in immunity and inflammation are the most rapidly evolving in the mammalian genome ( Lindblad-Toh et al . , 2011; Casanova et al . , 2013; Quintana-Murci and Clark , 2013 ) . Survival from infection requires a trade-off between alleles that promote or limit inflammation to balance immunity vs immunopathology . We speculate that the virome or other chronic infections hide or enhance the effects of genetic variations in immune responsiveness by complementing chromosomal variations in immune response genes . As the nature of the virome changes in persons growing up in different cultural and economic environments , it is possible that the immunophenotype of the host changes , and the beneficial or deleterious effects of existing genetic variation are unmasked by removal of complementation provided by chronic virus infection . It is also plausible that the striking auto-inflammation observed in humans with a variety of immune defects could be due to even well controlled herpesvirus infection alone or in combination with other chronic infections . Our data suggest that analysis of the metagenome , including the virome , may be of value in linking human phenotype and genotype ( Virgin , 2014; Virgin and Todd , 2011 ) . Recent rapid advances in sequencing and analysis of the metagenome will make integration of data from the virome into human genetic studies practical ( Virgin , 2014 ) .\nHOIL-1 KO mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , have been described previously ( Tokunaga et al . , 2009 ) . C57BL/6J mice or HOIL-1 WT littermates were used as wild type controls . Rag1−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) and bred to HOIL-1 KO mice . Il6−/− mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory . Caspase 1;Caspase 11-deficient mice with or without a Caspase 11 transgene were kindly provided by Vishva Dixit , Genentec , San Francisco USA . All mice were housed and bred at Washington University in Saint Louis in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with Federal and University guidelines and protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University under protocol number 20140244 . Mice were inoculated between 8 and 11 weeks of age . L . monocytogenes wild type strain EGD was used for this study . Listeria glycerol stocks were stored at −80 °C , and thawed and diluted into PBS for intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) injection into mice . To determine tissue burden , spleens and livers were homogenized in 10 ml PBS containing 0 . 05% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates . Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . Small sections of spleen and liver were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological analysis . The type II Prugniaud strain of T . gondii expressing a firefly luciferase ( PRU-Fluc-GFP , provided by J . Boothroyd , Stanford University , Palo Alto , CA ) ( Saeij et al . , 2005 ) was used in all in vivo T . gondii experiments . Tachyzoites were grown by 2-day serial passage in human foreskin fibroblasts . For infections , freshly egressed parasites were filtered , counted , and injected i . p . into mice . Mice were with inoculated orally with 2 × 109 CFU C . rodentium strain DBS100 ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) from a fresh culture and monitored for morbidity and mortality . MHV68 WUMS ( ATCC VR1465 ) , MHV68 ORF73 . stop and γHV68 M3-Fluc were passaged and titered by plaque assay on NIH 3T12 cells . Virus stocks were stored at −80 °C , and thawed and diluted into PBS for i . p . or intranasal ( i . n . ) inoculation of mice . For experiments involving MHV68 ORF73 . stop , i . n . inoculation with 5 × 104 CFU was performed due to the low titer of the virus stock . To determine γHV68 titers in tissues , organs were placed in 1 ml of complete DMEM and frozen at −80°C . Samples were thawed prior to disruption with silica beads and virus titration by plaque assay . Before infection , exponentially replicating M . tuberculosis Erdman strain bacteria were washed in PBS + 0 . 05% Tween 80 , and sonicated to disperse clumps . Mice were exposed to 8 × 107 CFU of M . tuberculosis in an Inhalation Exposure System ( Glas-Col , Terre Haute , IN ) , which delivers ∼100 bacteria to the lung per animal . After 24 hr post infection , two mice per group were sacrificed , and lungs were harvested to determine infection efficiency , which was about 100 CFU/lung/mouse . Experimental mice were sacrificed 70 days after infection , and lungs and spleen were harvested for CFU , and serum was collected for cytokine analysis . Bacterial burdens were determined by plating serial dilutions of lung and spleen homogenates onto 7H10 agar plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 weeks prior to counting colonies . MHV68 reactivation from latency and preformed virus was assayed as described previously ( Weck et al . , 1996 ) . Briefly , peritoneal exudate cells were plated in twofold serial dilutions ( 24-wells per dilution ) onto permissive mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) monolayers and scored for cytopathic effect ( CPE ) 3 weeks later . Reactivation of lytic virus from a peritoneal cell leads to complete CPE of the MEF monolayer . To measure preformed infectious virus in the sample , parallel samples of cells were mechanically disrupted to kill the cells but keep any infectious virus intact . These samples were plated and scored as described above . Using the Poisson distribution , CPE in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one reactivation event is likely to have occurred per well , and is used to determine the frequency of reactivating cells in the sample . To determine the frequency of cells harboring viral genome , peritoneal cells were assayed by nested PCR for viral genome as described previously ( Weck et al . , 1999 ) . The detection of PCR product in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one genome was present per well . Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously ( Hwang et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , bone marrow was extracted from mouse femurs and allowed to differentiate in DMEM containing 10% FBS , 10% CMG14-12 cell-conditioned media as a source of M-CSF ( Takeshita et al . , 2000 ) , 5% horse serum , 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 2 mM L-Glutamine for 7 days . For cytokine and transcript analyses following Listeria infection of macrophages , adherent cells were scraped and seeded in tissue culture-treated plates in the absence of M-CSF . After 3 days , macrophages were infected with 106/ml Listeria in the presence or absence of 100 U/ml IFNγ . 2 hr post-infection , 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin were added to kill the Listeria . Cell supernatants were harvested at indicated times and frozen at −80 °C prior to cytokine analysis . Cells were lyzed in TRI-Reagent for RNA extraction . For Listeria growth/killing assays , macrophages were seeded in non-tissue culture treated dishes in the absence of M-CSF . After 1 day , cells were treated with 300 µ/ml IFNγ or untreated , and 48 hr later scraped replated on sterile coverslips . After 3 hr , cells were infected with 105/ml Listeria from an overnight standing culture and centifuged to synchronize the infection . 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . At the indicated times , coverslips were washed with warm PBS , then lyzed in 10 ml cold water to release the bacteria . Serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates , and Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . For MHV68 growth analysis , adherent cells were scraped and seeded in tissue culture-treated plates in the presence of M-CSF . After 2 days , macrophages were treated with 0 . 1 U/ml IFNγ or untreated , and 12 hr later infected with MHV68 at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 0 . 05 for 1 hr with occasional rocking at 37°C and 5% CO2 . Cells were washed once with medium and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine ( with or without 0 . 1 U/ml IFNγ ) for the indicated period of time at 37°C and 5% CO2 , before being frozen at −80 °C . Virus titers were determined by plaque assay following two freeze–thaw cycles . Cells were flushed from the peritoneum of mice that had been mock infected or infected with MHV68 for 32 days with ice cold DMEM containing 10% FBS and 2 mM L-Glutamine . 5 × 105 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24 well plates in duplicate wells per timepoint and allowed to adhere overnight . Non-adherent cells were washed away with warm medium , and the remaining cells were infected with 105 CFU Listeria from a overnight standing culture by spinocculation at 600×g for 10 min at room temperature , and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 . 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . Coverslips were washed in warm PBS prior to hypotonic lysis of the cells in ice cold water to release the bacteria . Serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates , and Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . Recipient mice were exposed to 1200 rad of whole body irradiation , and injected intravenously with 10 million whole bone marrow cells from donor mice . Mice were allowed to reconstitute for 8 to 10 weeks before Listeria challenge . Mice were bled at 7 weeks post-irradiation to determine percent chimerism . Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR ( qRT-PCR ) for the presence of Rbck1/Hoil1 intron 7 ( in control cells; 5′-ATG CTG GAG TAG AGG CTG GA-3′ and 5′-TGA CTG CTG CTT GGA GAG TG-3′ ) , or the neomycin-resistance cassette ( in HOIL-1 KO cells; 5′-CAA GAT GGA TTG CAC GCA GG-3′ and 5′-GCA GCC GAT TGT CTG TTG TG-3′ ) . Rag2 was used as a normalization control ( 5′-GGG AGG ACA CTC ACT TGC CAG TA-3′ and 5′-AGT CAG GAG TCT CCA TCT CAC TGA-3′ ) . Imaging was performed as described previously ( Saeij et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , mice were injected i . p . with 150 mg/kg D-Luciferin ( Biosynth AG , Switzerland ) and allowed to remain active for 5 min . Animals were subsequently anesthetized with 2% isoflurane for 5 min and then imaged with a Xenogen IVIS 200 machine ( Caliper Life Sciences , Hopkinton , MA ) . Data were analyzed using Living Image software ( Caliper Life Sciences ) . Peritoneal exudate cells were harvested by peritoneal lavage with 10 ml ice cold FACS buffer ( PBS supplemented with 2% FBS and 50 U/ml Penicillin and 50 µg/ml Streptomycin ) . Splenocytes were isolated by filtering through two 100 μm cell strainers into 10 ml ice cold FACS buffer . Residual red blood cells were lysed with Red Blood Cell lysis buffer ( Sigma , St Louis , MO ) , counted and stained for flow cytometry . Cells were incubated with FACS buffer plus 1% rat serum , 1% hamster serum and 1% Fc-block for 15 min . Surface staining was performed for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were then washed and fixed with 2% formaldehyde . Cells were analyzed on an LSRII or LSR Fortessa flow cytometer ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and the data were analyzed using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Inc , Ashland , OR ) . The following antibodies were used: anti-CD3e ( clone 145-2C11 , Biolegend , San Diego , CA ) , anti-CD4 ( clone RM4-5 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD8 ( clone 53-6 . 7 , Biolegend ) , anti-IgM ( clone II/41 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD19 ( clone 6D5 , Biolegend ) , anti-NK1 . 1 ( clone PK136 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-NKp46 ( clone 29A1 . 4 , eBioscience , San Diego , CA ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone HK1 . 4 , Biolegend ) , anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , Biolgend , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 , BD Pharmingen ) , anti-F4/80 ( clone BM8 , Biolegend ) . Cytokines in mouse serum and cell supernatants were quantitated using a custom Procarta Immunoassay Kit ( Affymetrix , Santa Clara , CA ) and analyzed on a Bio-Plex 200 System ( BioRad , Hercules , CA ) or by ELISA ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , respectively , according to the manufacturers’ instructions . Spleen sections were homogenized , and macrophages were lysed in TRI-Reagent ( Sigma ) , and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions to isolate total RNA . RNA was isolated from peritoneal cells using RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , Netherlands ) . RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNA-free DNase ( Ambion , Austin , TX ) prior to first strand cDNA synthesis with ImProm-II ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and random hexamer primers . Quantitative PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus machine using Power SYBR Green master mix ( Applied Biosystems , Waltham , MA ) and primers specific for ribosomal protein S29 ( Rps29; 5′-AGC AGC TCT ACT GGA GTC ACC-3′ and 5′-AGG TCG CTT AGT CCA ACT TAA TG-3′ ) , Rbck1/Hoil-1 ( 5′-ATT CGG CGG AAT GGA GAC GG-3′ and 5′-CTG GTT GGT CCT GGG CTT CG-3′ ) , Trib3 ( 5′-CAC ACT GCC ACA AGC ACG GG-3′ and 5′-CAC GCA GGC ATC TTC CAG G-3′ ) , Tbc1d20 ( 5′-TGA GGG AGG GCT CCT GAC TG-3′ and 5′-AGC AGC ACT TGC TGG TAG TCC-3′ ) , Il12b ( 5′-GCA CGG CAG CAG AAT AAA TAT GAG-3′ and 5′-TTC AAA GGC TTC ATC TGC AAG TTC-3′ ) , Tnf ( 5′-GGG TGA TCG GTC CCC AAA GG-3′ and 5′- CTG AGT GTG AGG GTC TGG GC-3′ ) , Il6 ( 5′-GCC AGA GTC CTT CAG AGA GAT ACA-3′ and 5′-CTT GGT CCT TAG CCA CTC CTT C-3′ ) , Ifng ( 5′-ATG AAC GCT ACA CAC TGC ATC-3′ and 5′-CCA TCC TTT TGC CAG TTC CTC-3′ ) and iNos ( Nos2 ) ( 5′-GTT CTC AGC CCA ACA ATA CAA GA-3′ and 5′-GTG GAC GGG TCG ATG TCA C-3′ ) . Transcript levels were analyzed using the ΔΔCT method , with Rps29 as the reference gene . Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin followed by 70% ethanol , paraffin embedded , sectioned and stained with Periodic acid-Schiff ( PAS ) . Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were measured on a Liasys 330 ( AMS Diagnostics , Weston , FL ) , complete blood counts were measured on a Hemavet 1700 ( Drew Scientific , Waterbury , CT ) , and white blood cell differential counts were performed by Washington University Division of Comparative Medicine Animal Diagnostic Laboratory staff . Statistical significance was determined using GraphPad Prism software . The specific tests performed are noted in the figure legends .",
         "The immune system protects an individual from invading bacteria , viruses and parasites , as well as malfunctioning or cancerous host cells . However , some people inherit genetic defects that cause part of the immune system to be missing or to not work properly . This is called a genetic immunodeficiency , and puts individuals at a higher risk of infection and disease . The symptoms of immunodeficiencies can vary substantially between individuals , even when they have defects in the same gene . For example , only some of the individuals who have defects in both of their copies of a gene called HOIL-1—which has been linked to several roles in the body's immune response—are reported to suffer from an altered susceptibility to bacterial infections and chronic ( persistent ) inflammation . Gaining a clear understanding of the possible factors that influence such variations in the symptoms of genetic immune deficiencies could help to speed up their diagnosis , as well as helping to develop more effective treatments . MacDuff et al . studied mice that had mutations in both copies of the mouse equivalent of the HOIL-1 gene . These mice , when raised in a clean barrier facility that reduces their exposure to viruses , were severely immunodeficient and died when infected by certain bacteria and parasites , including Listeria monocytogenes . However , they were able to tolerate infections with a herpesvirus or the bacterium that causes tuberculosis . The immunodeficiency to L . monocytogenes was linked to problems producing protective molecules called cytokines , which form a crucial part of the immune response . Unexpectedly , MacDuff et al . found that a chronic herpesvirus infection substantially protected these very immunodeficient animals from infection with Listeria monocytogenes , and the mice were able to efficiently produce protective cytokines . Mice with two other distinct genetic deficiencies that affect their immune system were also better able to survive otherwise lethal bacterial infections if they had a long-term herpesvirus infection . Macduff et al . suggest that the chronic herpesvirus infection stimulates the immune system , and so allows it to compensate for the lack of cytokine production associated with various immunodeficiencies , including those caused by mutations in the HOIL-1 gene . This suggests that the presence of viruses or other long-term infections may be responsible for some of the variability seen in the symptoms of different individuals with the same genetic immunodeficiency . This is an important concept since essentially all humans have life-long chronic infections from various herpesviruses , as well as other viruses that form the human virome .",

         "Variation in the presentation of hereditary immunodeficiencies may be explained by genetic or environmental factors . Patients with mutations in HOIL1  present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency . We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation . However , they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii or Citrobacter rodentium . Increased susceptibility to Listeria was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines . In contrast , HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis or murine γ-herpesvirus 68  , and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype . Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice , highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies . HOIL-1  , HOIP  and SHARPIN form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex  , which linearly ubiquitinates receptor signaling complex components such as NEMO to enhance NF-κB activation after engagement of immune receptors including TNF-R1 , IL-1R , CD40 , TLRs and NOD2  . Recently , HOIL-1/LUBAC was also shown to be important for activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in macrophages via linear ubiquitination of ASC  . These data suggest that HOIL-1 plays multiple roles in inflammation and infection . Loss of HOIP catalytic activity in B cells results in the impaired development of B1 B cells and antibody responses to antigen  . Sixteen patients with bi-allelic mutations in the gene encoding HOIL-1 have been reported  . Although there are multiple possible explanations for the variable clinical presentations of the reported patients including hypomorphic expression of HOIL-1 or effects of mutations on protein function , another possibility was that environmental factors alter the clinical presentation of HOIL-1 deficiency . In this study we define the function of HOIL-1 in murine immunity to infection and explore the potential role of the virome in determining HOIL-1 deficiency-associated phenotypes . Within the virome , herpesviruses persistently infect most humans , and exert significant effects on innate immunity in mice during experimental chronic infection , including increasing resistance to tumors and a range of pathogens  . However , the potential effects of chronic infection on the phenotypic manifestations of immune deficiencies have not been considered . In this study , we show that chronic herpesvirus infection can alter the presentation of several genetic immunodeficiencies in mice . We first found that , in naïve mice , HOIL-1 is essential during infection with Listeria monocytogenes , Toxoplasma gondii and Citrobacter rodentium and for efficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to be essential for resistance to lethal infection by hematopoietic cells during Listeria infection . In contrast , HOIL-1 knock-out  mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , were resistant to infection with murine γ-herpesvirus 68  and Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Although HOIL-1 KO mice raised in a barrier facility did not display signs of auto-inflammation , chronic infection with MHV68 or M . tuberculosis resulted in elevated inflammatory cytokines circulating in the serum , similar to that observed in some patients with mutations in RBCK1  . Interestingly , latent infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 deficient mice from lethality during Listeria infection and induced high levels of the protective cytokine , interferon-gamma  . These data indicate that chronic infections can modify the clinical presentations of genetic variations , thereby opening a new avenue for the analysis and interpretation of human genotype-phenotype association studies . We speculate that the protective effect of chronic herpesvirus infection is due to the stimulation of the function of the innate immune system in a manner that compensates for deficient early cytokine responses associated with multiple immunodeficiencies . HOIL-1 KO mice  were born at Mendelian ratios and , in contrast to SHARPIN-deficient mice , failed to develop TNFα-driven inflammatory skin disease  and exhibited normal histology of lymphoid organs , liver , lung , and kidney , and the presence of Peyer's patches along the small intestine  . Aged HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited deposits of material that stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent and was resistant to digestion with diastase , similar to the amylopectin-like material observed in humans with HOIL-1 deficiency   . Importantly , these barrier-raised mice showed minimal signs of baseline hyper-inflammation . In this regard , HOIL-1 KO mice exhibited normal numbers of lymphoid and myeloid cells in the spleen and thymus , normal complete blood counts  , and no detectable increase of tumor necrosis factor alpha  or interleukin 6  in serum  . However , in the peritoneum , HOIL-1 KO mice contained about twofold more B cells , T cells and resident macrophages without changes in other cell types  . To determine the requirement for HOIL-1 during the immune response to infection in vivo , we challenged HOIL-1 KO mice with a number of different pathogens . Strikingly , HOIL-1 KO mice were highly susceptible to even low dose infection with the facultative gram-positive intracellular bacterium , Listeria monocytogenes  , with 80% , 80% and 50% of mice succumbing to infection within 10 days of intraperitoneal  inoculation with 105 , 104 and 103 CFU , respectively  . Although bacterial burdens in the spleens and livers of control and HOIL-1 KO mice were similar 1 and 3 days post-infection with 105 CFU , bacterial CFUs were elevated in HOIL-1 KO mice by 6 days post-infection , indicating that HOIL-1 KO mice were unable to control and clear the bacteria  . Further , these mutant mice developed large inflammatory lesions in the liver , elevated liver enzymes in the serum , and widespread tissue destruction in the spleen  .

Pathology of HOIL-1 KO mice during Listeria infection . Each symbol represents an individual mouse and the mean is indicated . DOI: http://dx . Despite infection with 5000 parasites resulting in lethality in only 20% of control mice , 100 parasites was sufficient to induce lethality in 100% of HOIL-1 KO mice . Quantification of parasite-encoded luciferase expression in vivo revealed that HOIL-1 KO mice failed to control T . HOIL-1 KO mice also succumbed to infection with the enteric gram-negative pathogen Citrobacter rodentium , whereas control mice were highly resistant  . These data indicated that loss of HOIL-1 expression confers profound immunodeficiency in barrier-raised mice . One patient with HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency showed signs of recovery from hyper-inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  . In mice , reciprocal bone marrow transplantation revealed that expression of HOIL-1 in radiation-sensitive hematopoietic cells was critical for resistance to Listeria  . We noted that control mice that received control bone marrow were slightly more susceptible to infection than non-irradiated control mice  , suggesting that reconstitution does not fully restore the immune system of a lethally irradiated mouse to that of a non-irradiated animal . Despite this caveat , irradiated wild-type control mice that received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow and were challenged with 105 Listeria 8 weeks later succumbed to infection at the same rate as HOIL-1 KO mice that had received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow . These data indicate that , while HOIL-1 expression is essential in bone marrow-derived cells , HOIL-1 may also play a role in radiation resistant cells during Listeria infection . HOIL-1 is required in an innate immune cell compartment during Listeria infection . Survival of RAG1 KO HOIL-1 WT  and RAG1 KO HOIL-1 KO  mice following infection with 104 CFU Listeria . Each symbol represents an individual mouse and the mean log10 is indicated . Confirmation of hematopoietic reconstitution of bone marrow chimeric mice . DOI: http://dx . org/10 . Statistical analyses were performed using two-way ANOVA with Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison test . T and B cell-deficient RAG1 HOIL-1 double KO mice succumbed to infection significantly faster than RAG1 KO mice  , and exhibited elevated bacterial burden in the spleen and liver 3 days post-infection  , indicating that HOIL-1 plays an essential role in innate immunity during Listeria infection . Further , HOIL-1 KO mice immunized with a low dose of Listeria were capable of mounting a protective adaptive response to a high dose secondary challenge with Listeria 28 days later  . was a borderline dose required to successfully immunize control mice in our experiments , despite being sufficient to induce lethality in 50% of HOIL-1 KO mice  . Together , these data do not rule out a role for HOIL-1 in adaptive immunity , but show that HOIL-1 plays a major role in hematopoietic cells to foster innate immunity to Listeria infection . These cytokines are each well recognized to be essential for survival after Listeria infection  through their role in coordinating activation of NK cells , NKT cell and T cells to produce IFNγ required for the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells . Therefore , to further define a role for HOIL-1 in the innate immune system , we determined whether HOIL-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages  produced cytokines in response to Listeria infection with or without IFNγ treatment . Compared to control cells , HOIL-1 KO macrophages secreted only 50% , 20% and 10% of the expected levels of TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12p70 protein , respectively  . Consistent with a role for HOIL-1 in the activation of the NF-κB transcription factor following TLR stimulation , Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO macrophages expressed decreased levels of Tnf , Il6 and Il12b mRNA  . The defects in cytokine transcript levels were of smaller magnitude than the decreases in secreted protein , particularly for Tnf , suggesting that HOIL-1 may also be involved in cytokine translation or secretion . However , HOIL-1 KO macrophages killed Listeria after activation with IFNγ as effectively as control cells , indicating the selectivity of HOIL-1 effects on macrophage function  . TNFα  , IL-6  and IL-12p70  protein in macrophage culture supernatants following infection with Listeria  ± IFNγ co-treatment . Data represent the mean ± SEM of macrophages derived from two mice per genotype analyzed in triplicate and are representative of at least three independent experiments .

Statistical analyses were performed using t-test . HOIL-1 is important for induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines by innate cells following Listeria infection in vivo . Induction of cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from uninfected  RAG1 KO HOIL-1 WT  and RAG1 KO HOIL-1 KO  mice or 3 hr after infection with 104 Listeria . 018 We confirmed that induction of Tnf and Il6 mRNA was significantly impaired following Listeria infection in vivo by measuring cytokine transcripts in peritoneal cells from mice 3 to 12 hr after infection  . Surprisingly , Il12b transcript levels were similar in HOIL-1 KO mice , with a significant difference being detected at only 6 hr after infection . Similar decreases in Tnf and Il6 mRNA were observed in mice on the Rag1−/− background at 3 hr post-infection , confirming that these differences are due to a defect in innate immunity in the absence of HOIL-1  . We also noted that fewer NK cells and neutrophils were present in the peritoneum 6 hr after Listeria infection , suggesting delayed recruitment or proliferation of these cell types  . These decreases in cytokine production and delayed cell recruitment likely synergize with defects in IL-1β and TNFα signaling observed by others  to compromise antibacterial immunity , and may contribute to the impaired induction of Ifng mRNA observed by 12 hr  . These data indicate that HOIL-1 plays a critical role in coordinating essential early cytokine responses after Listeria infection . To assess the generality of this phenotype we infected HOIL-1 KO mice with murine γ-herpesvirus 68  , a genetic relative of the common persistent human herpesviruses , Epstein–Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus   . HOIL-1 KO mice survived MHV68 infection for at least 3 months . Despite normal establishment of latency as determined by the number of cells carrying MHV68 genome 28 days after infection  , the efficiency of MHV68 reactivation from latency in explanted peritoneal cells was significantly impaired  . tuberculosis over 70 days of infection , and in fact exhibited lower bacterial colony counts in the spleen while counts in the lung were no different than controls  .

Statistical analyses were performed by calculating the number of control and HOIL-1 KO cells required for 63 . 2% of reactions to be positive for viral genome for each individual experiment by non-linear regression , then comparing these values by paired t-test . 005 The ability of HOIL-1 KO mice to effectively control chronic herpesvirus infection allowed us to test the hypothesis that persistent virus infection might alter two phenotypes , hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency , in which HOIL-1 KO mice appear to differ from some reported patients with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1   . Notably , patients with HOIL-1 deficiency and hyper-inflammation exhibited increased expression of IL-6 and TNFα in the serum and increased expression of mRNA for Il6 in blood cells  . We therefore examined the serum of MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice for cytokines essential for resistance to Listeria but deficient in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . As previously observed  , latent infection of control mice with MHV68 was associated with an increase in circulating levels of TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFNγ compared with uninfected mice  . In HOIL-1 KO mice , MHV68 latently resulted in small but significant increases in TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels , and a more striking increase in IFNγ levels compared to latently infected controls . tuberculosis also exhibited increased expression of both IL-6 and TNFα in serum at 70 days post-infection  . Therefore , there is an overlap between cytokines expressed in hyper-inflammatory patients and in chronically-infected HOIL-1 KO mice . MHV68 latency has been shown previously to induce symbiotic protection against Listeria infection in wild-type mice  . Because expression of TNFα , IL-6 and IFNγ are essential for control of Listeria infection in mice  , and were impaired in Listeria-infected HOIL-1 KO mice  , but elevated in MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice , we considered whether chronic MHV68 infection could complement the profound immunodeficiency observed in Listeria-infected barrier-raised HOIL-1 KO mice . MHV68 latency also protected HOIL-1 KO mice from a dose of Listeria at least 1000-fold higher than the LD50 for MHV68-negative mice  . A viral mutant capable of acute lytic infection but unable to efficiently establish latency   was unable to efficiently protect HOIL-1 KO or control mice from Listeria infection , demonstrating that latent MHV68 is required to complement HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency to Listeria  .

As predicted from the cytokine levels in the serum , MHV68 latency resulted in small but significant increases in Tnf , Il6 and Il12b transcripts prior to Listeria challenge  . While MHV68 latency did not rescue the induction of Tnf or Il6 transcripts in HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria , Il12b transcript levels were increased approximately twofold , and were comparable to levels in control mice . More significantly , Ifng and Nos2  transcripts were elevated approximately 200-fold and 1000-fold , respectively , in latently infected control and HOIL-1 KO mice  , and further induced by 3 hr after infection with Listeria  . Ifng transcript levels were significantly higher in latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice following infection with Listeria than in control mice . These data suggest that MHV68 latency by-passes the requirement for TNFα and IL-6 during early Listeria infection by enhancing the induction of IFNγ and downstream effector molecules important for controlling Listeria infection . To test whether peritoneal macrophages from latently infected HOIL-1 KO mice had an increased capacity to kill Listeria , we explanted peritoneal macrophages from mock or latently infected mice , infected them with Listeria , killed extracellular bacteria with gentamycin treatment , and compared the number of CFU at 6 hr to the number of CFU at the beginning of the experiment . As expected , cells from mock infected control mice exhibited mild listericidal activity and cells from latently infected control mice had an enhanced ability to kill Listeria ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ,  ) . Macrophages from mock-infected HOIL-1 KO mice had a slightly impaired ability to control Listeria infection . However , MHV68 latency in HOIL-1 KO mice enhanced the ability of macrophages to kill Listeria , generating a capacity to kill similar to that observed with macrophages from control mice . Together , these data suggest that MHV68 latency induces an environment that enhances the ability of HOIL-1-deficient cells to kill and respond to Listeria . To determine whether the viral complementation of immunodeficiency was unique to HOIL-1 , we latently infected IL-6 , Caspase-1-deficient and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-double-deficient mice  , which survive MHV68 infection but are all highly susceptible to Listeria infection   . These data indicate that the capacity of chronic MHV68 to reverse a significant immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutations in Rbck1  , and suggest that chronic viral infections may alter phenotypes of many host allelic variants . tuberculosis in mice . The requirement of HOIL-1 for the induction of protective inflammatory cytokines , TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12 , following infection of macrophages with Listeria in vitro is consistent with reports that LUBAC is required for efficient NF-κB activation following TLR engagement  , but not with a recent report that NF-κB activation following stimulation of TLR4 and TNF-R1 on macrophages by LPS and TNFα , respectively , is unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency  . These apparently conflicting results suggest that HOIL-1 and LUBAC may not only have cell-type specific functions  , but also stimulus-specific roles that vary between different cell types . tuberculosis infection—two pathogens that also infect macrophages—by HOIL-1-deficient mice . Since the negative regulator of NF-κB signaling , A20 , binds to linear ubiquitin chains  , HOIL-1/LUBAC may also be important for recruiting A20 to receptor signaling complexes to turn off signaling . Therefore , receptor signaling may be sustained in cells in HOIL-1 KO mice , resulting in the increase in TNFα , IL-6 and IL-12 , and ultimately IFNγ protein , observed in the serum of chronically infected mice . Decreased viral reactivation may be the result of this increased IFNγ , the inability of latently infected cells to response to a stimulus of reactivation or a combination thereof . It is unclear why HOIL-1 KO mice are extremely susceptible to some pathogens , yet control other infections remarkably well . Other possibilities include a differential requirement for the innate immune system to hold the acute infection in check while an adaptive response is being generated , the speed at which the pathogen replicates , the tissues that it damages , and whether pathology during acute infection is mostly immune- or pathogen-derived . Further studies will be required to address these possibilities . As reported previously  , MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 and IFNγ in the serum of wild-type animals , which were further increased in HOIL-1 KO mice . Indeed , MHV68 infection did not enhance the transcription of Tnf , and only marginally enhanced the transcription of Il6 and Il12b even in control mice following Listeria infection , and did not rescue the defect in Tnf and Il6 induction observed in HOIL-1 KO mice . Conversely , transcription of Ifng and the effector molecule , iNOS  , was elevated in cells from latently infected mice and enhanced substantially by both HOIL-1 KO and control animals very rapidly following infection with Listeria . In a latently infected animal , IFNγ is already present and so IL-12 and additional IFNγ may be induced more rapidly . Together , these data suggest that the constant presence of low levels of IFNγ driven by latent virus infection results in an increase in the basal expression levels of downstream effector molecules and the priming of cells for the enhanced immediate killing of Listeria upon infection , as well as for a more rapid further induction of IFNγ and its effector molecules in response to the bacterial challenge . HOIL-1 KO mice bred in a high grade barrier facility failed to exhibit certain phenotypes of HOIL-1 deficient patients , specifically by not exhibiting baseline hyper-inflammation and by displaying a striking immunodeficiency out of proportion to that observed in some humans with bi-allelic mutations in RBCK1  . Most humans are infected life-long with multiple herpesviruses  , and many also carry other chronic or latent infections such as tuberculosis . Importantly , we observed complementation of immunodeficiency to Listeria by chronic herpesvirus infection in four different strains of immunodeficient mice , revealing virus infection as one possible environmental factor that might alter the genotype-phenotype relationship for patients with mutations in immune system genes . HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with either a herpesvirus or M . tuberculosis also exhibited increases in some of the same cytokines reported in the serum of HOIL-1 deficient humans . At least three of the HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with at least one herpesvirus  , and it is likely that other chronic infections were present . However , in the absence of data regarding the complete infection status of the HOIL-1 mutant patients , the relevance of the mouse studies to the human phenotypes is unclear . The genes involved in immunity and inflammation are the most rapidly evolving in the mammalian genome  . We speculate that the virome or other chronic infections hide or enhance the effects of genetic variations in immune responsiveness by complementing chromosomal variations in immune response genes . It is also plausible that the striking auto-inflammation observed in humans with a variety of immune defects could be due to even well controlled herpesvirus infection alone or in combination with other chronic infections . Our data suggest that analysis of the metagenome , including the virome , may be of value in linking human phenotype and genotype  . Recent rapid advances in sequencing and analysis of the metagenome will make integration of data from the virome into human genetic studies practical  . HOIL-1 KO mice , with null mutations in the Rbck1 gene that encodes HOIL-1 , have been described previously  . All mice were housed and bred at Washington University in Saint Louis in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with Federal and University guidelines and protocols were approved by the Animal Studies Committee of Washington University under protocol number 20140244 . monocytogenes wild type strain EGD was used for this study . Listeria glycerol stocks were stored at −80 °C , and thawed and diluted into PBS for intraperitoneal  injection into mice . 05% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions were plated on brain heart infusion agar plates . Listeria CFU were counted after overnight growth at 37°C . Small sections of spleen and liver were also fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological analysis . gondii expressing a firefly luciferase   was used in all in vivo T . inoculation with 5 × 104 CFU was performed due to the low titer of the virus stock . Samples were thawed prior to disruption with silica beads and virus titration by plaque assay . After 24 hr post infection , two mice per group were sacrificed , and lungs were harvested to determine infection efficiency , which was about 100 CFU/lung/mouse . Experimental mice were sacrificed 70 days after infection , and lungs and spleen were harvested for CFU , and serum was collected for cytokine analysis .

Briefly , peritoneal exudate cells were plated in twofold serial dilutions  onto permissive mouse embryonic fibroblast  monolayers and scored for cytopathic effect  3 weeks later . Reactivation of lytic virus from a peritoneal cell leads to complete CPE of the MEF monolayer . To measure preformed infectious virus in the sample , parallel samples of cells were mechanically disrupted to kill the cells but keep any infectious virus intact . Using the Poisson distribution , CPE in 63 . 2% of wells indicates that one reactivation event is likely to have occurred per well , and is used to determine the frequency of reactivating cells in the sample . To determine the frequency of cells harboring viral genome , peritoneal cells were assayed by nested PCR for viral genome as described previously  . 2% of wells indicates that one genome was present per well .

Non-adherent cells were washed away with warm medium , and the remaining cells were infected with 105 CFU Listeria from a overnight standing culture by spinocculation at 600×g for 10 min at room temperature , and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 . 50 μg/ml gentamycin was added after 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria . Coverslips were washed in warm PBS prior to hypotonic lysis of the cells in ice cold water to release the bacteria .

         "Rapid and flexible interpretation of conflicting sensory inputs in the context of current goals is a critical component of cognitive control that is orchestrated by frontal cortex . The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood . To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions , we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict . We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times . These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) , followed by medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) and then by orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics , and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex .\nFlexible control of cognitive processes is fundamental to daily activities , including the execution of goal-directed tasks according to stimulus inputs and context dependencies . An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . A canonical example of this type of conflict is the Stroop task: subjects are asked to name the font color of a word where the semantic meaning conflicts with the color signal ( e . g . the word 'red' shown in green versus red ) . Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times , attributed to weaker signals ( color processing ) that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information ( Stroop , 1935 ) . The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control . Neurophysiological , neuroimaging , and lesion studies have ascribed a critical role in cognitive control to networks within frontal cortex ( Miller , 2000; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) , yet the neural circuit dynamics and mechanisms responsible for orchestrating control processes remain poorly understood . Lesion studies ( Cohen and Servan-Schreiber , 1992; Perrett , 1974 ) , human neuroimaging measurements ( Egner and Hirsch , 2005a; MacDonald , 2000 ) , and macaque single unit recordings ( Johnston et al . , 2007 ) implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Miller and Cohen , 2001 ) . The medial frontal cortex ( mFC ) also participates in cognitive control , possibly in a conflict monitoring capacity ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) ( Ito et al . , 2003; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments ( Brown and Braver , 2005; Ito et al . , 2003; Johnston et al . , 2007; Rothé et al . , 2011 ) —an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) . An alternative and influential theoretical framework posits that the ACC monitors for potential conflicts and subsequently directs the dlPFC to engage control processes ( Botvinick et al . , 2001; Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006; Kerns et al . , 2004; MacDonald , 2000 ) but the relative contributions of dlPFC , mFC , and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate ( Aarts et al . , 2008; Cole et al . , 2009; Fellows and Farah , 2005; Mansouri et al . , 2007; Milham and Banich , 2005; Milham et al . , 2003; Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . Previously , some neuroimaging studies have suggested that these frontal cortex regions can be differentiated based on the presence or absence of conflict signals ( MacDonald , 2000 ) . The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions ( attention , decision-making , uncertainty , cognitive control ) . These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques ( Shenhav et al . , 2013 ) . Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control . We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses . We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color . We observed conflict-selective activity throughout several regions in frontal cortex: ACC , mFC , dlPFC , and also orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC ) . Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control . Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials , and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time , depended on the task , and exhibited adaptation over trials . We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence . Conflict responses emerged first in the ACC and subsequently emerged in dlPFC and mFC and finally in OFC . These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control .\nWe focused on 469 electrodes located in areas within frontal lobe which have been previously implicated in executive function: medial frontal cortex ( mFC , n = 111 ) , orbitofrontal cortex ( OFC , n = 156 ) , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC , n = 168 ) and the anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC , n = 34 ) . We applied a non-parametric analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to measure whether and when the physiological responses differed between congruent and incongruent trials . An electrode was considered conflict-selective if the F-statistic was greater than a significance threshold computed by a permutation test with P = 0 . 001 for 50 consecutive milliseconds ( Materials and methods ) . The latency was defined as the first time of this threshold-crossing . Figure 2 shows an example electrode from the left Anterior Cingulate Cortex that responded differentially between congruent and incongruent trials during the Stroop task . These signals were better aligned to the speech onset than to the stimulus onset , as shown in the response-aligned view ( compare Figure 2A–C with Figure 2D–F ) . During the Stroop task , the response-aligned signals were significantly stronger for the incongruent ( brown ) trials compared to the congruent ( black ) trials ( Figure 2D , P < 10–5 , ANOVA ) , and were invariant to the particular word/color combinations ( Figure 2G ) . Incongruent trials could be discriminated from congruent trials at a latency of 669 ± 31 ms ( mean ± s . e . m . ) before the onset of the response ( Figure 2D ) . This conflict response was also specific to the Stroop task; there was a significant interaction between congruency and task ( F = 13 . 5 , P = 0 . 007 , ANOVA ) . The same stimuli did not elicit differential activity during the Reading task ( Figure 2F ) . We assessed the correlation between the neural signal strength and behavioral reaction times in single trials . The maximal gamma power during each incongruent trial ( using the average gamma power yielded similar results ) was positively correlated with the behavioral reaction times ( Figure 2H , ρ = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 02 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 006Figure 2 . Example electrode in left Anterior Cingulate Cortex . ( A ) Average gamma power signals aligned to the stimulus onset from an electrode during the Stroop task , for congruent ( black ) or incongruent ( brown ) stimuli . For display purposes only , we z-scored the gamma power by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation of power during the baseline period ( 500 ms prior to stimulus onset ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 009 Any differences between congruent and incongruent trials in the stimulus-aligned analyses can be confounded by the reaction time differences; therefore , we focus subsequent analyses on the response-aligned signals . More example electrodes are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ( dlPFC ) and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ( OFC ) . Using the aforementioned criteria , we identified n = 51 conflict selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Stroop task , with contributions from 13 subjects ( Supplementary files 2 and 3 ) . These electrodes were distributed throughout different subregions within frontal cortex ( Figure 3A ) . To evaluate whether random variation in the signals could give rise to apparent conflict-selective electrodes , we randomly shuffled the congruent/incongruent trial labels 10 , 000 times and applied the same statistical criteria ( Materials and methods ) . Across our population , we found n = 4 . 4 ± 0 . 03 false positive electrodes ( mean ± s . e . m . , out of 469 electrodes ) , which corresponds to a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of q = 0 . 01 , which is significantly less than our observation of n = 51 electrodes . The number of conflict-selective electrodes within each subregion was significantly greater than expected by chance ( Figure 3B , P < 0 . 01 , all regions ) . We repeated the analyses during the Reading task . In contrast with the Stroop task , we only observed n = 3 conflict-selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Reading task ( out of 469 electrodes ) , a number that is within the false positive rate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 011 To account for within-subject and across-subject variation , we used a multilevel model ( Aarts et al . , 2014 ) to conduct a group analysis of the physiological responses , with electrodes nested within subjects ( Materials and methods ) . Across the population , we observed a significant interaction between the factors congruency and task on the gamma power ( χ2=9 . 2 , P = 0 . 002 ) . Consistent with the single electrode examples , gamma power was greater for incongruent compared to congruent trials , but only during the Stroop task ( Figure 4A , Stroop: P < 10–3 , Reading: P = 0 . 56 ) . We computed the average response in each region ( Figure 4B ) . Each electrode’s response was normalized by dividing the power during incongruent trials by the power in congruent trials ( dividing the brown curve by the black curve in Figure 2 ) , computing the logarithm and finally pooling within each region . The pooled responses in the OFC are visually less compelling ( Figure 4B , bottom right subplot ) due to the heterogeneity in the latency of the individual electrodes but the responses in the OFC were as vigorous as the ones in other areas ( e . g . Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Similar conclusions were reached when plotting the pooled responses aligned to stimulus onset ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 012Figure 4 .

( D ) For incongruent trials , there was a significant interaction between trial history and task ( P = 0 . 03 , multilevel model ) . Gamma power was larger for incongruent trials preceded by congruent trials ( cI ) compared to incongruent trials preceded by incongruent trials ( iI ) , particularly during the Stroop task ( blue , P = 0 . 001 ) , compared to the Reading task ( green , P = 0 . 72 ) . Data beyond the range of the x-axis are shown in the first or last bins . ( E ) For congruent trials , there was no interaction between trial history and task ( P = 0 . 17 , multilevel model ) . Gamma power was similar in congruent trials preceded by incongruent trials ( iC ) compared to congruent trials preceded by congruent trials ( cC ) during the Stroop task ( blue , P = 0 . 16 ) and during the Reading task ( green , P = 0 . 19 ) .

Same as in Figure 4B , but data are aligned to the stimulus response onset ( t=0 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 016 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a link between the neural signals described in the previous section and cognitive control: the neural signals correlated with reaction times , showed behavioral adaptation , and demonstrated error monitoring . As shown in previous studies , there was a wide distribution of behavioral reaction times ( Figure 1B ) . Consistent with the example electrode in Figure 2 , behavioral reaction times across the population correlated with the strength of the physiological signals , even after controlling for trial history ( Figure 4C , P < 10–5 , sign-rank test ) . The strength of these neural signals also revealed a neural correlate of the behavioral Gratton effect documented in Figure 1D: gamma power was greater in cI compared to iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . Using the aforementioned multilevel model , we found a significant interaction between trial history ( cI or iI ) and task ( χ2=4 . 4 , P = 0 . 03 ) . This Gratton effect was stronger in the Stroop task ( P < 0 . 001 ) than in the Reading task ( P = 0 . 72 ) . These differences were not observed for cC versus iC trials , where the interaction was not significant ( χ2=1 . 9 , P = 0 . 17 ) ( Figure 4E ) . This analysis was performed after removing stimulus repetition trials . The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions ( F = 0 . 25 , P = 0 . 86 , ANOVA ) . To control for reaction time effects on these comparisons , we ran an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) to test for a main effect of trial history on the gamma power with the behavioral reaction time as a covariate ( Materials and methods ) . The neural Gratton effect during the Stroop task persisted under these controlled conditions ( P = 0 . 0002 , multilevel model ) . We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions , with similar results ( P = 0 . 01 , multilevel model ) . Together , these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times . The results presented above focus on the neural signals filtered within the gamma frequency band ( 70–120 Hz ) . We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals ( 1 to 100 Hz ) as well as in the theta , ( 4 to 8 Hz ) , beta , ( 9 to 30 Hz ) , and low gamma ( 30–70 Hz ) bands . No conflict selective responses were observed in the broadband signals or low gamma band . We found conflict-selective responses both in the theta and beta bands ( see example in Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–f ) . Across theta and beta frequency bands , we also observed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task ( theta: P < 10–5 , beta: P < 10–4 , multilevel model ) . Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band , conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast to the results in the gamma band , power in the theta and beta bands decreased during incongruent trials . Furthermore , power in the theta and beta frequency bands was not correlated with reaction times ( theta: P = 0 . 43 , beta: P = 0 . 09 , sign-rank test ) . In addition to separately examining the responses in different frequency bands , an important aspect of encoding of cognitive information is the relationship between signals across frequencies . In particular , several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band ( Canolty et al . , 2006; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Tort et al . , 2008 ) . We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Consistent with previous studies , we found that 50% of the electrodes demonstrated significant theta-gamma coupling . However , the strength of this coupling was not different between congruent and incongruent trials across the population of conflict-selective electrodes ( P = 0 . 52 , sign-rank test ) . The conflict responses reported above are based on correct trials only . Yet , error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits ( Bonini et al . , 2014; Shenhav et al . , 2013; Yeung et al . , 2004 ) . To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring , we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials . In these trials , subjects initially made an erroneous response and rapidly corrected themselves with the right answer . Given the high performance level of all subjects , the number of such trials is low . However , these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection ( as opposed to error trials without any self-correction ) . An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in Figure 5A . The subject initially made an incorrect response ( green ) , which was rapidly followed with the correct response ( red ) . Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response . In contrast , the following corrected behavioral response exhibited no such post-response signal . Additionally , these error-monitoring signals were not observed in correct incongruent trials ( Figure 2D ) , and were consistent across the n = 11 self-corrected trials for this subject ( Figure 5B , P = 0 . 001 , signed rank test ) . Another example electrode is shown in Figure 5C–D . There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials ( greater than five trials ) for this analysis . For each electrode , we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction . Of those n = 7 electrodes , n = 5 electrodes showed evidence of error monitoring ( Figure 5E , P < 0 . 05 , sign-rank test ) . Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small , these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals . Furthermore , these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 017Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 018 We observed conflict-selective responses in the anterior cingulate cortex , medial frontal cortex , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex . To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs , we compared , across those four regional groups , the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated . Comparing latencies across regions is difficult , especially across subjects with varying reaction times . For a controlled and direct comparison , we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas ( Figure 6 ) . The relative latencies were significantly different across the regions ( P = 0 . 01 , permutation test , post-hoc testing was controlled for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure , Materials and methods ) . Conflict responses in the ACC preceded those in all the other frontal lobe regions , followed 207 ± 40 ms later by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 388 ± 83 ms later by medial frontal cortex . Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 ± 78 ms after dlPFC . This entire processing cascade took approximately 500 ms . For comparison , subjects’ behavioral reaction times to incongruent trials were 1105 ± 49 ms . The latency difference between ACC and dlPFC is based on 6 electrode pairs: one ACC electrode and six simultaneously recorded dlPFC electrodes . There was only one pair of simultaneous recordings between ACC and OFC and we do not report this value in Figure 6 . The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects ( Supplementary file 3 ) . These results suggest a temporal hierarchy of cognitive control mechanisms culminating in speech onset . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 019Figure 6 . Latency Comparisons across regions . Latency differences between different regions computed from all pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . np denotes the number of electrode pairs . Because we only consider simultaneously recorded electrodes here , not all the electrodes modulated by conflict can be paired with any other electrode . Supplementary file 3 shows the number of electrodes modulated by conflict in each area and subject . There was only one electrode pair between ACC and OFC and therefore we do not show the latency difference between these two regions here . Significant latency differences ( P < 0 . 05 , permutation test , Materials and methods ) are shown in black , and non-significant differences in gray . ACC leads both mFC ( P = 0 . 001 ) and dlPFC ( P = 0 . 02 ) , with OFC following dlPFC ( P = 0 . 009 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12352 . 020\nWe used intracranial field potentials to measure the dynamics of conflict responses across frontal cortex leading up to the behavioral response in the Stroop task . Previous physiological and functional neuroimaging studies have documented the involvement of multiple of these frontal cortex areas in the Stroop or similar tasks ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kolling et al . , 2012; MacDonald , 2000; Niendam et al . , 2012; Oehrn et al . , 2014; Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The intracranial field potential recordings reported here show conflict-selective signals in ACC ( e . g . Figure 2 ) , dlPFC ( e . g . Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , mFC ( e . g . Figure 4B ) and OFC ( e . g . Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . The mFC and dlPFC have been previously implicated in cognitive control , and these structures are extensively connected to the rest of frontal cortex areas ( Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . The role of the OFC in cognitive control during Stroop-like tasks has not been reported previously , possibly because of technical challenges in neuroimaging near this area ( Weiskopf et al . , 2006 ) . We presented several lines of evidence that demonstrate that these conflict-selective physiological signals are relevant for behavior during the Stroop task . Longer behavioral reaction times were correlated with greater gamma power on a trial-by-trial basis during the Stroop task but not during the Reading task , even after accounting for trial history and for differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli ( Figure 2H , 4C ) . The same identical stimuli can elicit a range of behavioral reaction times and this internal degree of conflict can be captured , at least partly , by the strength of gamma power in frontal cortex in each trial . The neural correlates of behavioral adaptation ( Gratton effect [Gratton et al . , 1992] ) were observed in the ACC , consistent with prior studies based on human single neuron recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) , neuroimaging ( Botvinick et al . , 1999; Kerns , 2006 ) and also in accordance with the behavioral effects of ACC resection ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect , suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized . The physiological responses in these areas were stronger in cI trials ( incongruent trials that were preceded by congruent trials ) than iI trials ( Figure 4D ) . While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies ( Botvinick et al . , 1999 ) , single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship ( iI > cI ) ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . These differences point to potentially interesting distinctions between the activity of individual neurons and coarser population measures that warrant further investigation . Another discrepancy between neuroimaging studies and single unit recordings is the presence of conflict responses and error signals . Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses ( Cole et al . , 2009; Emeric et al . , 2010; Ito et al . , 2003; Taylor et al . , 2006 ) , see however ( Ebitz and Platt , 2015 ) , whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC . There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes ( Carter et al . , 1998; Carter et al . , 2000; Nee et al . , 2011; Swick and Turken , 2002 ) . Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials , high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations . A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex ( Bonini et al . , 2014 ) , and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The current work demonstrates the coexistence of both error signals and conflict signals . The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals ( Figure 5 ) . In addition , the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict ( Yeung et al . , 2004 ) and scalp EEG studies ( Hughes and Yeung , 2011 ) . These results are consistent with computational models suggesting that these signals may represent a general error-likelihood prediction , of which conflict and error detection are special cases ( Brown and Braver , 2005 ) . It has been suggested that ACC and supplementary eye field neurons in macaque monkeys respond to specific stimulus and/or behavioral combinations but are not directly modulated by conflict ( Cole et al . , 2009; Nakamura et al . , 2005 ) . At the level of the intracranial field potentials reported here , the modulation of conflict trials observed in the four frontal cortex regions could not be ascribed to specific stimulus or behavioral responses ( e . g . Figure 2G ) and were also task dependent ( compare Figure 2A versus 2C ) . In these patients , we did not have access to single neuron responses and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons show distinct patterns of responses that are averaged out at the field potential level . Besides the high gamma band , we also observed conflict responses in the beta and theta bands , but not the low gamma band ( e . g . Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Previous work has suggested differential roles for distinct oscillatory components of the local field potential ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Kahana et al . , 2001; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; von Stein and Sarnthein , 2000 ) . There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components . Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior . Additionally , conflict responses were characterized by increased power in the gamma band , but decreased power in the theta and beta bands ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Previous scalp EEG recordings ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014; Ullsperger et al . , 2014; van Driel et al . , 2015 ) have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power , suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales . We also observed a decrease in beta power , which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands ( Crone et al . , 1998a; Crone et al . , 1998b ) . Differences across tasks , recording methods , and targeted regions should be interpreted with caution . The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood . One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population ( Logothetis et al . , 2001; Mitzdorf , 1987 ) and can act as channels for communication ( Cavanagh and Frank , 2014 ) , whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate ( Buzsaki et al . , 2012; Ray and Maunsell , 2011 ) . Along these lines , we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs , leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response . While we observed conflict responses throughout frontal cortex , the spatiotemporal resolution of our intracranial recordings allowed us to separate regions by the latency at which conflict-selective responses emerge with respect to speech onset . By comparing pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes , we found that conflict responses in the ACC lead the dlPFC by ~200 ms . Medial frontal cortex is anatomically close and extensively connected to the ACC , and the two regions are often grouped together ( Cavanagh et al . , 2009; Ridderinkhof et al . , 2004 ) . Yet , conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds , suggesting an important distinction between the two regions ( Rushworth et al . , 2004 ) . The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade . The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control ( e . g . see Figure 2 in Shenhav et al , Neuron 2013 ) . In particular , stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex , where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions , followed by dlPFC , and finally mFC , and OFC . Since the local field potential pools over many neurons , latency measures can be influenced by a variety of factors , such as the proportion of neurons selective for conflict and their laminar organization . Yet , at least in the ACC , the temporal profile of conflict responses we observed is similar to responses from human single unit recordings ( Sheth et al . , 2012 ) . The relatively long delays between regions are also particularly intriguing . There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet , it takes 100–200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas ( Figure 6 ) . Daily decisions require integration of different goals , contexts , input signals , and the consequences of the resulting actions . The current study provides initial steps to elucidate not only which brain areas participate in cognitive control on a trial-by-trial basis but also their relative interactions and differential roles . The relative latency measurements and correlations between neural activity and reaction time provide a framework to constrain theories of cognitive control , and propose a plausible flow of conflict responses through frontal cortex .\nSubjects were 15 patients ( 10 male , Ages 10–50 , Supplementary file 1 ) with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy treated at Children’s Hospital Boston ( CHB ) , Johns Hopkins Medical Institution ( JHMI ) , Brigham and Women’s Hospital ( BWH ) , or Taipei Veterans General Hospital ( TVGH ) . These subjects were implanted with intracranial electrodes in frontal cortex for clinical purposes . Five other subjects participated in this task but they were excluded from the analyses because they did not have any electrodes in frontal cortex . All studies were approved by each hospital’s institutional review boards and were carried out with the subjects’ informed consent . Subjects were implanted with 2 mm diameter intracranial subdural electrodes ( Ad-Tech , Racine , WI , USA ) that were arranged into grids or strips with 1 cm separation . Electrode locations were determined by clinical considerations . There were 1397 electrodes ( 15 subjects ) . Sampling rates ranged from 256 Hz to 1000 Hz depending on the equipment at each institution: CHB ( XLTEK , Oakville , ON , Canada ) , BWH ( Bio-Logic , Knoxville , TN , USA ) , JHMI ( Nihon Kohden , Tokyo , Japan ) , and TVGH ( Natus , San Carlos , CA ) . All the data were collected during periods without any seizure events or immediately following any seizures . A schematic of the task is shown in Figure 1 . After 500 ms of fixation , subjects were presented with a word stimulus for 2 s . The stimulus presentation was 3 s in two subjects . Stimuli were one of three words ( Red , Blue , Green ) presented in the subjects’ primary language ( CHB , BWH , JHMI: English; TVGH: Mandarin ) either in red , blue , or green font color . Stimuli subtended approximately 5 degrees of visual angle and were centered on the screen . Trials were either congruent ( C ) , where the font color matched the word , or incongruent ( I ) , where the font color conflicted with the word . The order of congruent and incongruent trials was randomized . Approximately 40% of the trials were incongruent trials . Within congruent trials and within incongruent trials all color-word combinations were counter balanced and randomly interleaved . Subjects were asked to either name the color ( Stroop task ) or read the word ( Reading task ) within the time limit imposed by the stimulus presentation time . Each block contained 18 trials , and the two tasks were completed in separate blocks . Most subjects completed 18 blocks of the Stroop task and 9 blocks of the Reading task ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Audio was recorded using a microphone at 8192 Hz sampling rate . No correct/incorrect feedback was provided . Electrodes were localized by co-registering the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) with the postoperative computer tomography ( CT ) ( Destrieux et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . In 4 subjects without a postoperative CT , electrodes were localized using intraoperative photographs and preoperative MRI . For each subject , the brain surface was reconstructed from the MRI and then assigned to one of 75 regions by Freesurfer . Depth electrodes were assigned to either a subcortical structure or to gyri/sulci . We focused on those electrodes in four frontal cortex regions ( ACC: anterior and middle-anterior cingulate gyrus , mFC: superior frontal gyrus , dlPFC: middle frontal gyrus , and OFC: orbitofrontal gyrus ) . To determine the behavioral reaction time for each trial , the short-time energy was computed from the audio recordings . For an audio signal x ( t ) , the short-time energy E ( t ) is defined as: E ( t ) =∑m=0m=T[x ( m ) w ( t−m ) ]2 , where T is the length of the recording and w ( t ) is a 300-point Hamming window ( ~40 ms ) . Speech onset was defined as the first time when the energy crossed a threshold set as 1 standard deviation above the baseline . Only trials where the subject gave a single verbal response and the speech onset could be identified were considered correct trials . Unless otherwise noted , analyses in this manuscript used correct trials only . Electrodes with significant spectral noise were excluded from analysis ( n = 25 out of 1397 total electrodes ) . For each electrode , a notch filter was applied at 60 Hz , and the common average reference computed from all channels was subtracted . Power in the theta ( 4–8 Hz ) , beta ( 9–30 Hz ) , and high-gamma band ( 70–120 Hz ) was extracted using a moving window multi-taper Fourier transform ( Chronux toolbox [Mitra and Bokil , 2008] ) with a time-bandwidth product of five and seven tapers . The window size was 200 ms with 10 ms increments . In several figures , the gamma power was z-scored for display purposes ( see figure legends ) . To determine whether and when an electrode responded selectively to conflict , we used a sliding F-statistic procedure ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Electrodes with differential responses between congruent and incongruent trials were selected by computing the F-statistic , for each time bin , comparing the neural responses between congruent and incongruent trials . Electrodes were denoted as ‘conflict selective’ if ( 1 ) the F-statistic exceeded a significance threshold for 50 consecutive milliseconds , and ( 2 ) the average neural response exceeded one standard deviation above the baseline period at least once during the trial . A null distribution generated by randomly permuting the labels was used to set the significance threshold with P = 0 . 001 . The latency at which congruent and incongruent stimuli could be discriminated was defined as the first time of this threshold crossing . For the response-aligned view , only electrodes where the latency preceded the response were included in subsequent analysis . This selection process was independently performed for each electrode in both stimulus-aligned and response-aligned analyses , and separately for the Stroop and Reading task . We used a permutation test with 10 , 000 shuffles to obtain a false discovery rate for our selection process . The congruent/incongruent trial labels were randomized 10 , 000 times and we measured the average number of electrodes across our population that passed the selection procedure . For the selected electrodes obtained with the procedure described in the previous section , we performed a number of within-electrode analyses . We measured single-trial correlations with behavioral reaction times , assessed the significance of interactions and simple/main effects , and controlled for confounds in measuring the neural Gratton effect . To account for both within-subject and across-subject variance , statistical testing of the electrophysiological data was conducted with multilevel models ( Aarts et al . , 2014; Goldstein , 2011 ) ( also known as random effect models ) . Random factors included electrodes nested within subjects . Significance of interactions and/or main effects was assessed with a likelihood ratio test against a null model excluding that particular term . For comparison of latency across regions , we restricted our analyses to simultaneous measurements made within each subject . We computed the latency difference for each pair of simultaneously recorded electrodes from different regions . The F-statistic of this latency difference across the groups was compared against a null distribution generated by shuffling , within each subject , the region labels ( n = 10 , 000 shuffles ) . Post hoc testing used the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple comparisons . To measure cross-frequency coupling between the theta and gamma frequency bands , we used the Modulation Index ( MI ) defined previously ( Tort et al . , 2008 ) . Activity in the theta ( 4–8 Hz ) and high gamma ( 70–120 Hz ) bands was obtained with a zero-phase least-squares finite impulse response ( FIR ) filter . Instantaneous phase and amplitude was extracted with the Hilbert Transform . For the Stroop and Reading Task separately , the MI was computed as the Kullback-Leiber distance between the phase-amplitude histogram and a uniform distribution . For comparison between tasks , the number of trials was equalized . This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions . Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al . ( Canolty et al . , 2006 ) . Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials . To compare the strength of cross-frequency coupling between congruent and incongruent conditions , we computed the difference in MI between the two conditions while equalizing the trial count . This difference was compared against a null distribution generated by randomly shuffling the congruent and incongruent labels .",
         "The brain adapts to control our behavior in different ways depending on the specific situation , which is particularly useful when deciding how to interpret conflicting sets of information . The 'Stroop task' is a classic demonstration of this process . In this task , individuals are shown words where the color and the meaning of the text conflict – for example , the word 'green' is written in blue . When asked what the color of the text is , individuals must suppress the instinct to read the word . This causes them to make more mistakes and take longer to decide on an answer than when they perform the same task using words that have no conflict ( for example , when “red” is written in red ) . Previous work has suggested that several regions within part of the brain called the frontal cortex play a role in this cognitive control process . However , the relative contributions of each of these regions , and the order in which they are activated , remain unclear . This is in part due to the fact that accurately measuring the electrical activity of the frontal cortex requires implanting electrodes into the brain . Tang et al . took advantage of a rare opportunity to record this activity from a group of patients who had electrodes implanted in their frontal cortex to treat epilepsy . The electrical signals recorded by these electrodes as the subjects performed the Stroop task revealed that four regions in the frontal cortex altered their activity during trials where the color and the meaning of a word conflicted . These responses corresponded with the subject’s reaction time , changed depending on the exact nature of the task , and even reflected the subjects’ errors . These responses arose at different times in different regions , allowing Tang et al . to suggest how signals flow through the frontal cortex during cognitive control . In the future it will be important to further understand how the regions of the frontal cortex identified by Tang et al . interact with each other and to establish their roles in cognitive control . These observations could then be used to produce a theoretical framework that describes how the brain adapts behavior to different circumstances .",

         "The relative roles of distinct subregions within frontal cortex are poorly understood . To examine the dynamics underlying cognitive control across frontal regions , we took advantage of the spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in epilepsy patients while subjects resolved color-word conflict . We observed differential activity preceding the behavioral responses to conflict trials throughout frontal cortex; this activity was correlated with behavioral reaction times . These signals emerged first in anterior cingulate cortex  before dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  , followed by medial frontal cortex  and then by orbitofrontal cortex  . These results disassociate the frontal subregions based on their dynamics , and suggest a temporal hierarchy for cognitive control in human cortex . An important case of cognitive control arises when input stimuli elicit conflicting responses and subjects must select the task-relevant response despite competition from an often stronger but task-irrelevant response  . Such incongruent inputs lead to longer reaction times , attributed to weaker signals  that must be emphasized over the automatic processing of word information  . The Stroop task is frequently used in cognitive neuroscience and clinical psychology and forms the foundation for theories of cognitive control . Neurophysiological , neuroimaging , and lesion studies have ascribed a critical role in cognitive control to networks within frontal cortex  , yet the neural circuit dynamics and mechanisms responsible for orchestrating control processes remain poorly understood . Lesion studies  , human neuroimaging measurements  , and macaque single unit recordings  implicate the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  in providing top-down signals to bias processing in favor of the task-relevant stimuli  . Recordings and lesions studies in the macaque anterior cingulate cortex   suggest that ACC neurons are principally involved in monitoring for errors and making between-trial adjustments  —an idea that has received support by a recent study in the human ACC  . Recent work has also demonstrated that the supplementary motor area and the medial frontal cortex play an important role in monitoring for errors  . Several human neuroimaging studies are consistent with this notion  but the relative contributions of dlPFC , mFC , and ACC to cognitive control remain a matter of debate  . The challenge in dissociating the relative roles of these regions during Stroop-like tasks is that increased task difficulty recruits a host of executive functions  . These functions are associated with neural activity spanning tens to hundreds of milliseconds and the underlying dynamics are difficult to untangle with the low temporal resolution of existing neuroimaging techniques  . Human single neuron studies provide millisecond resolution but have focused on individual regions  . We took advantage of the high spatiotemporal resolution of intracranial recordings in human epilepsy patients and the ability to record simultaneously from multiple regions to directly investigate the dynamics of conflict responses during cognitive control . We hypothesized that subregions of frontal cortex could be differentiated based on the temporal profile of their conflict responses . We recorded intracranial field potentials from 1397 electrodes in 15 subjects while they performed the Stroop task or a variation in which they were asked to read the word instead of focusing on its color . We observed conflict-selective activity throughout several regions in frontal cortex: ACC , mFC , dlPFC , and also orbitofrontal cortex  . Several analyses link these signals to cognitive control . Neural responses increased for incongruent compared to congruent trials , and these signals correlated with behavioral reaction time , depended on the task , and exhibited adaptation over trials . We compared pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes to disassociate these different regions based on the timing of these conflict responses rather than their presence or absence . These observations propose a plausible flow of signals underlying cognitive control . We focused on 469 electrodes located in areas within frontal lobe which have been previously implicated in executive function: medial frontal cortex  , orbitofrontal cortex  , dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  and the anterior cingulate cortex  . We applied a non-parametric analysis of variance  to measure whether and when the physiological responses differed between congruent and incongruent trials . These signals were better aligned to the speech onset than to the stimulus onset , as shown in the response-aligned view  . During the Stroop task , the response-aligned signals were significantly stronger for the incongruent  trials compared to the congruent  trials  , and were invariant to the particular word/color combinations  . Incongruent trials could be discriminated from congruent trials at a latency of 669 ± 31 ms  before the onset of the response  . We assessed the correlation between the neural signal strength and behavioral reaction times in single trials . The maximal gamma power during each incongruent trial  was positively correlated with the behavioral reaction times  . The total number of trials for each condition is indicated in the upper right . Single-trial data for congruent  and incongruent  trials . Same as  , but showing data from the Reading task . Gamma power was better aligned to the behavioral response , and was stronger for incongruent compared to congruent trials . The dashed line indicates the response-aligned latency , defined as the first time point at which incongruent and congruent trials can be discriminated . There was a correlation between the maximal z-scored gamma power and behavioral reaction times during incongruent trials  . DOI: http://dx . 007Figure 2—source data 1 . Example conflict-selective electrode in the right dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex . DOI: http://dx . 009 Any differences between congruent and incongruent trials in the stimulus-aligned analyses can be confounded by the reaction time differences; therefore , we focus subsequent analyses on the response-aligned signals . Using the aforementioned criteria , we identified n = 51 conflict selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Stroop task , with contributions from 13 subjects  . These electrodes were distributed throughout different subregions within frontal cortex  . To evaluate whether random variation in the signals could give rise to apparent conflict-selective electrodes , we randomly shuffled the congruent/incongruent trial labels 10 , 000 times and applied the same statistical criteria  . The number of conflict-selective electrodes within each subregion was significantly greater than expected by chance  . In contrast with the Stroop task , we only observed n = 3 conflict-selective frontal cortex electrodes during the Reading task  , a number that is within the false positive rate . Chance levels were computed using a permutation test  . The number of observed electrodes was significantly above chance for all regions  . DOI: http://dx . org/10 . 011 To account for within-subject and across-subject variation , we used a multilevel model  to conduct a group analysis of the physiological responses , with electrodes nested within subjects  . We computed the average response in each region  . Each electrode’s response was normalized by dividing the power during incongruent trials by the power in congruent trials  , computing the logarithm and finally pooling within each region . The pooled responses in the OFC are visually less compelling  due to the heterogeneity in the latency of the individual electrodes but the responses in the OFC were as vigorous as the ones in other areas  . Gamma power in frontal cortex correlates with behavior . Gamma power showed a significant interaction between Congruency and Task  . Power was larger for incongruent versus congruent trials during the Stroop task  but not during the Reading task  . The statistical analyses directly compare the gamma power , we show the log-ratios here for display purposes only . Normalized gamma power log-ratio averaged across electrodes from each of the four different frontal cortex regions during the Stroop task . Distribution of Pearson correlation coefficients between the maximal gamma power and behavioral reaction time during incongruent trials for n = 51 frontal cortex electrodes . Gamma power was larger for incongruent trials preceded by congruent trials  compared to incongruent trials preceded by incongruent trials  , particularly during the Stroop task  , compared to the Reading task  . Data beyond the range of the x-axis are shown in the first or last bins . For congruent trials , there was no interaction between trial history and task  .

Distribution of the gamma power log-ratio between incongruent trials preceded by congruent trials  compared to incongruent trials preceded by incongruent trials  . For the anterior cingulate cortex electrode in Figure 2:  Phase-amplitude distribution during the Stroop task for the example electrode shown in Figure 2  . The observed Modulation Index  is significantly greater than the surrogate distribution generated by adding a lag between the phase and amplitude measurements , demonstrating that the amplitude of the gamma band is strongly coupled to the phase of the theta band . The null distribution  was generated by randomly permuting the congruent and incongruent labels . Across the population of electrodes:  The percent of total electrodes in each region  that had significant phase-amplitude coupling . For this comparison , the number of congruent and incongruent trials was equalized before computing the MI . DOI: http://dx . Stimulus-aligned population averages . Same as in Figure 4B , but data are aligned to the stimulus response onset  . DOI: http://dx . org/10 . 016 Several lines of evidence demonstrate a link between the neural signals described in the previous section and cognitive control: the neural signals correlated with reaction times , showed behavioral adaptation , and demonstrated error monitoring . The strength of these neural signals also revealed a neural correlate of the behavioral Gratton effect documented in Figure 1D: gamma power was greater in cI compared to iI trials  . Using the aforementioned multilevel model , we found a significant interaction between trial history  and task  . These differences were not observed for cC versus iC trials , where the interaction was not significant   . The Gratton effect was present in all four frontal regions and there were no statistically significant differences in the strength of the effect across regions  . We also explicitly ruled out reaction time differences by subsampling to match the reaction time distribution between conditions , with similar results  . Together , these results suggest that the neural signals described here code for an internally perceived level of conflict that exhibits conflict adaptation and correlates with the across-trial variability in reaction times . We also examined the responses elicited in the broadband signals  as well as in the theta ,  , beta ,  , and low gamma  bands . Consistent with the results reported in the gamma frequency band , conflict responses in the theta and beta bands were more prominent during the Stroop task compared to the Reading task  . In addition to separately examining the responses in different frequency bands , an important aspect of encoding of cognitive information is the relationship between signals across frequencies . In particular , several studies have demonstrated that the amplitude of the gamma band is coupled to the phase of slower oscillations in the theta band  . We therefore examined the degree of cross-frequency coupling between the signals in the gamma and theta bands  . Yet , error monitoring has also been ascribed to frontal cortical circuits  . To investigate whether the same electrodes responding to conflict are also involved in successful error monitoring , we analyzed the neural signals during self-corrected trials . Given the high performance level of all subjects , the number of such trials is low . However , these trials are particularly interesting because we can be certain that there was successful error detection  . An example self-corrected trial from the ACC electrode shown previously is illustrated in Figure 5A . The subject initially made an incorrect response  , which was rapidly followed with the correct response  . Increased gamma power was observed after onset of the erroneous response . There were only two subjects contributing n = 7 conflict-signaling electrodes that had a sufficient number of self-correction trials  for this analysis . For each electrode , we compared the difference in neural signals during the one-second post-response window between the initial error and the following self-correction . Although the number of electrodes and trials in this analysis is small , these results provide a direct correlate of error monitoring signals . Furthermore , these results highlight that the same electrodes that respond to conflict leading up to the behavioral response can also show post-response error monitoring . An example self-correction trial from the ACC electrode in Figure 2 when the word Green colored in red was presented . The single trial gamma power is shown on top , with the speech waveform below . Average gamma power aligned to the onset of the initial error response  and the onset of the corrected response  for n = 11 self-correction trials . Same as  for another example electrode in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Across the n = 7 electrodes with n = 10 or greater self-correction trials , the z-scored gamma power during the initial error response was larger than during the corrected response . To examine the dynamics of cognitive control orchestrating the transformation of conflicting visual signals to motor outputs , we compared , across those four regional groups , the latencies relative to behavioral response onset at which the congruent and incongruent trials could be discriminated . For a controlled and direct comparison , we restricted the analysis to compute the latency differences between pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . This within-subject pairwise analysis had increased power to examine the relative dynamics between frontal lobe areas  . Signals in orbitofrontal cortex emerged 319 ± 78 ms after dlPFC . The other region comparisons have contributions from multiple electrodes in multiple subjects  . Latency Comparisons across regions . Latency differences between different regions computed from all pairs of simultaneously recorded electrodes . np denotes the number of electrode pairs . Supplementary file 3 shows the number of electrodes modulated by conflict in each area and subject . There was only one electrode pair between ACC and OFC and therefore we do not show the latency difference between these two regions here . Significant latency differences  are shown in black , and non-significant differences in gray . 020Figure 6—source data 1 . Data for region latency comparisons . 020\nWe used intracranial field potentials to measure the dynamics of conflict responses across frontal cortex leading up to the behavioral response in the Stroop task . Previous physiological and functional neuroimaging studies have documented the involvement of multiple of these frontal cortex areas in the Stroop or similar tasks  . The intracranial field potential recordings reported here show conflict-selective signals in ACC  , dlPFC  , mFC  and OFC  . We presented several lines of evidence that demonstrate that these conflict-selective physiological signals are relevant for behavior during the Stroop task . Longer behavioral reaction times were correlated with greater gamma power on a trial-by-trial basis during the Stroop task but not during the Reading task , even after accounting for trial history and for differences between congruent and incongruent stimuli  . The same identical stimuli can elicit a range of behavioral reaction times and this internal degree of conflict can be captured , at least partly , by the strength of gamma power in frontal cortex in each trial . The neural correlates of behavioral adaptation  were observed in the ACC , consistent with prior studies based on human single neuron recordings  , neuroimaging  and also in accordance with the behavioral effects of ACC resection  . Conflict responses throughout the other frontal cortex regions also demonstrated the neural Gratton effect , suggesting a more distributed network involved in across-trial adaptation than previously hypothesized . While the increased activity in cI trials compared to iI trials is consistent with neuroimaging studies  , single neuron recordings in a different Stroop-like task report the opposite relationship   . These differences point to potentially interesting distinctions between the activity of individual neurons and coarser population measures that warrant further investigation . Single unit recording in macaque ACC typically find error monitoring signals but not conflict-selective responses  , see however  , whereas human neuroimaging studies report both types of signals in ACC . There has been significant debate concerning whether action monitoring and conflict detection represent distinct processes  . Because both processes may co-occur on the same trials , high temporal resolution is required to disassociate the two computations . A recent human intracranial study has found error signals in supplementary motor area and medial frontal cortex  , and a human single unit study reported conflict signals in ACC  . The analysis of the few self-correction trials in our data suggests that the same areas responsible for pre-behavioral conflict signals can also produce post-behavioral response error-monitoring signals  . In addition , the relative timing of the conflict and error signals surrounding the neural responses confirms computational predictions based on a connectionist architecture to explain the mechanisms of conflict  and scalp EEG studies  . These results are consistent with computational models suggesting that these signals may represent a general error-likelihood prediction , of which conflict and error detection are special cases  . At the level of the intracranial field potentials reported here , the modulation of conflict trials observed in the four frontal cortex regions could not be ascribed to specific stimulus or behavioral responses  and were also task dependent  . In these patients , we did not have access to single neuron responses and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that individual neurons show distinct patterns of responses that are averaged out at the field potential level . Besides the high gamma band , we also observed conflict responses in the beta and theta bands , but not the low gamma band  . There were clear differences in the type of information conveyed by distinct frequencies components . Lack of significant correlations with reaction time in the theta and beta bands suggests that the gamma band better captures the behavior . Previous scalp EEG recordings  have demonstrated that conflict and/or error trials elicit increased theta power , suggesting potentially interesting differences in how theta is captured across spatial scales . We also observed a decrease in beta power , which is consistent with previous studies that correlate frontal cortex activation with desynchronization in the beta band and increased synchronization in the gamma bands  . The roles of different oscillatory components in neocortex are not clearly understood . One possibility is that lower frequency bands reflect the summed dendritic input of the nearby neural population  and can act as channels for communication  , whereas higher frequency bands represent the population spiking rate  . Along these lines , we speculate that the theta desynchronization we observe could reflect a reduction of inputs , leading to inhibition of the prepotent but erroneous response . While we observed conflict responses throughout frontal cortex , the spatiotemporal resolution of our intracranial recordings allowed us to separate regions by the latency at which conflict-selective responses emerge with respect to speech onset . Yet , conflict responses in the mFC trail the ACC by hundreds of milliseconds , suggesting an important distinction between the two regions  . The relative latency measurements place the OFC at the bottom of this cascade . The hierarchical cascade of processes described here is consistent with predictions from mechanistic models of cognitive control  . In particular , stimulus related signals are evident along the ventral visual stream early on and feed onto frontal cortex , where we find that ACC activity precedes activity in other frontal regions , followed by dlPFC , and finally mFC , and OFC . Since the local field potential pools over many neurons , latency measures can be influenced by a variety of factors , such as the proportion of neurons selective for conflict and their laminar organization . There are monosynaptic connections that link these four regions within frontal cortex and yet , it takes 100–200 ms to detect the relative activation between these areas  . The current study provides initial steps to elucidate not only which brain areas participate in cognitive control on a trial-by-trial basis but also their relative interactions and differential roles . The relative latency measurements and correlations between neural activity and reaction time provide a framework to constrain theories of cognitive control , and propose a plausible flow of conflict responses through frontal cortex . Subjects were 15 patients  with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy treated at Children’s Hospital Boston  , Johns Hopkins Medical Institution  , Brigham and Women’s Hospital  , or Taipei Veterans General Hospital  . Stimuli were one of three words  presented in the subjects’ primary language  either in red , blue , or green font color . The order of congruent and incongruent trials was randomized . Subjects were asked to either name the color  or read the word  within the time limit imposed by the stimulus presentation time . Each block contained 18 trials , and the two tasks were completed in separate blocks . Audio was recorded using a microphone at 8192 Hz sampling rate . In 4 subjects without a postoperative CT , electrodes were localized using intraoperative photographs and preoperative MRI . We focused on those electrodes in four frontal cortex regions  . To determine the behavioral reaction time for each trial , the short-time energy was computed from the audio recordings . For an audio signal x  , the short-time energy E  is defined as: E  =∑m=0m=T2 , where T is the length of the recording and w  is a 300-point Hamming window  . Only trials where the subject gave a single verbal response and the speech onset could be identified were considered correct trials . Unless otherwise noted , analyses in this manuscript used correct trials only . Power in the theta  , beta  , and high-gamma band  was extracted using a moving window multi-taper Fourier transform  with a time-bandwidth product of five and seven tapers . Electrodes were denoted as ‘conflict selective’ if  the F-statistic exceeded a significance threshold for 50 consecutive milliseconds , and  the average neural response exceeded one standard deviation above the baseline period at least once during the trial . A null distribution generated by randomly permuting the labels was used to set the significance threshold with P = 0 . For the response-aligned view , only electrodes where the latency preceded the response were included in subsequent analysis . This selection process was independently performed for each electrode in both stimulus-aligned and response-aligned analyses , and separately for the Stroop and Reading task . We used a permutation test with 10 , 000 shuffles to obtain a false discovery rate for our selection process . The congruent/incongruent trial labels were randomized 10 , 000 times and we measured the average number of electrodes across our population that passed the selection procedure . For the selected electrodes obtained with the procedure described in the previous section , we performed a number of within-electrode analyses . We measured single-trial correlations with behavioral reaction times , assessed the significance of interactions and simple/main effects , and controlled for confounds in measuring the neural Gratton effect . To account for both within-subject and across-subject variance , statistical testing of the electrophysiological data was conducted with multilevel models   . We computed the latency difference for each pair of simultaneously recorded electrodes from different regions . The F-statistic of this latency difference across the groups was compared against a null distribution generated by shuffling , within each subject , the region labels  . Post hoc testing used the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure to control for multiple comparisons . To measure cross-frequency coupling between the theta and gamma frequency bands , we used the Modulation Index  defined previously  . Activity in the theta  and high gamma  bands was obtained with a zero-phase least-squares finite impulse response  filter . This MI was compared against a surrogate distribution generated by randomly lagging the time series across 1000 repetitions . Similar results were obtained with the measure defined in Canolty et al . Results were also similar when a surrogate distribution was created by randomly pairing low-frequency phase with high-frequency power from different trials . To compare the strength of cross-frequency coupling between congruent and incongruent conditions , we computed the difference in MI between the two conditions while equalizing the trial count . This difference was compared against a null distribution generated by randomly shuffling the congruent and incongruent labels . "

         "Myosin 5a is a dual-headed molecular motor that transports cargo along actin filaments . By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step . Improving the spatial precision to the sub-nm regime provided evidence for an ångstrom-level structural transition in the motor domain associated with the power stroke . Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern . These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head–head coordination , the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps .\nMyosin 5a moves in a hand-over-hand fashion with individual heads moving by 74 nm and the center of mass by 37 nm for each step ( Vale , 2003; Sellers and Veigel , 2006; Hammer and Sellers , 2012 ) . A finely tuned kinetic sequence of ATP binding , hydrolysis , phosphate release and eventually ADP release by the enzymatic heads enables processive motion towards the ‘+’ end of actin filaments ( De La Cruz et al . , 1999; De La Cruz and Ostap , 2004; Rosenfeld and Sweeney , 2004; Sakamoto et al . , 2008; Forgacs et al . , 2008 ) . One of the most remarkable aspects of myosin 5a is the efficient conversion of chemical energy by the molecular-sized enzymatic heads into a translation of 74 nm along a 7 nm diameter actin filament in the presence of Brownian motion and a crowded cellular environment . Crystal structures of myosin 5a exist either with or without nucleotide , but only in the detached state ( Coureux et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) . Although these structures served as a model for the structural changes potentially induced by binding to actin , ( Volkmann et al . , 2005 ) the internally coupled rearrangement of the subdomains leading to ADP and phosphate release or dissociation from actin upon ATP binding could only be studied in silico ( Cecchini et al . , 2008 , 2010; Sweeney and Houdusse , 2010; Preller and Holmes , 2013 ) . The experimental challenge in revealing such structural dynamics has been largely of spatiotemporal origin , since they are likely on the Ångstrom scale and may be very transient . Similarly , there has been considerable interest in directly revealing the motion of the individual heads as myosin steps along actin in an attempt to unravel the origins of efficient motion on the nanoscale . Single molecule studies employing optical trapping ( Mehta et al . , 1999; Rief et al . , 2000 ) and fluorescence imaging ( Forkey et al . , 2003; Yildiz et al . , 2003; Snyder et al . , 2004; Warshaw et al . , 2005 ) have either reported periods of increased flexibility , ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) or partitioning of the step into sub-events ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Uemura et al . , 2004; Cappello et al . , 2007; Sellers and Veigel , 2010 ) . All resulting models involve a forward aiming power stroke followed by a Brownian search mechanism ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Okada et al . , 2007; Shiroguchi and Kinosita , 2007; Karagiannis et al . , 2014 ) . The power stroke of the attached head contributes only partially to the step by moving the pivot point that facilitates Brownian rotation of the unbound head . The bias towards the next binding site is believed to be provided by the recovery stroke and its stability , but how unidirectional stepping is achieved in the presence of such a large and mostly random motion remains unclear ( Shiroguchi et al . , 2011 ) . The first passage time of the translocating head is expected to be on the order of 100 µs , ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Hinczewski et al . , 2013 ) although the head spends tens of ms in the unbound state given the maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis and binding to actin ( Veigel et al . , 2002; Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) . Any technique aiming to visualize the structural dynamics of the motor domain or the motion of the unattached head would thus have to achieve simultaneous millisecond temporal and nanometer spatial precision . Optical trapping operates in this spatiotemporal regime , but it is not possible to monitor the motion of the unattached head without significant perturbation . Smaller labels affixed to the myosin motor domain or to calmodulin molecules on the lever arm , as available in fluorescence imaging , do not suffer from this limitation , but cannot provide sufficient localization precision on the millisecond time scale . We therefore designed an assay based on interferometric scattering microscopy ( iSCAT ) , ( Kukura et al . , 2009; Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura , 2012 ) a technique that has recently been shown to enable simultaneous high-speed and high-precision imaging of 20 nm diameter or smaller nanoscale scattering labels ( Andrecka et al . , 2013; Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) .\nWe attached a 20 nm gold label functioning as an efficient light scatterer to the N-terminus of the myosin 5 head and tracked its motion as the motor travels along actin filaments ( Figure 1A , inset ) . From the centre of mass of the signal produced by the label , we determined the position of the head as a function of time revealing discrete 74 nm steps at 1000 frames/s imaging speed with ∼4 nm positional precision ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , Video 1 ) . We verified that the addition of the 20 nm label did not interfere with the mechano–chemical cycle of myosin 5a by characterizing the speed of movement at different ATP concentrations . Our results compare well with those from a series of other single molecule studies where the molecule was labeled on the lever arm , the tail , or attached to a surface ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 003Figure 1 .

This file contains the iSCAT video from which the trajectory shown in Figure 1 of the main manuscript was obtained . The left panel presents the raw video format after referencing with the flat field image . The flat field accounts for illumination inhomogeneities and was generated as described in the Materials and Methods section . The right panel shows the static background subtracted video format . The background includes the average of 100 frames before the particle binds and removes the constant features which are part of the sample ( a . g . actin , glass roughness ) by simple subtraction ( Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . The video was taken at 1000 frames/s and at a magnification of 31 . 8 nm/pixel . The corresponding field of view shown is 1 . 30 × 1 . 30 μm2 and corresponds to a total recording time of 1 . 3 s . The video playback speed is 1000 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 007 In addition to the expected 74 nm steps , we observed periods of increased positional fluctuations between detachment and reattachment of the labeled head , previously interpreted as a signature of Brownian search ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . Our effective lateral localization precision of 4 nm at 1000 frames/s , however , enabled us to visualize the motion of the unbound head precisely and revealed a transient state with a center of mass just over half way between the two binding sites and offset by 40 nm perpendicular to the actin filament ( Figure 1B ) . From this position , the myosin head repeatedly moved back and forth between the next actin binding site and the transient state position ( Figure 1C , D ) . The same behavior sometimes occurred just before myosin detached from the filament at the end of a trajectory ( Figure 1E ) , although detachment of myosin with the labeled head bound was equally likely . On the rare occasions that the labelled leading head of myosin detached and reattached , it occupied a similar position in space to a translocating head ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) , suggesting that the transient state represents a true potential minimum of the one head bound state of myosin . In addition to providing nanometer precise information on the lateral position of the head through the center of mass of the signal , the iSCAT signal magnitude is very sensitive to the label-to-surface distance allowing for overall nanometric localization in three-dimensions ( Krishnan et al . , 2010 ) . This property arises from the interferometric nature of the technique , which scales the iSCAT signal as sinΦ , where Φ is the phase difference between scattered and reflected light fields . As the label moves perpendicular to the sample plane , the optical path length and with it the phase difference between the two fields changes by the following relation Φ = 4πηz/λ ( Figure 2A , inset ) . A complete signal inversion occurs for a displacement of z = λ/4η = 84 nm , where λ is the illumination wavelength ( 445 nm ) and η the refractive index of the medium ( 1 . 33 ) . Thus , variations in the axial distance of the motor domain with respect to the filament bound to the sample surface lead to changes in the scattering contrast . We often observed these changes in contrast between the actin bound and unbound states ( Figure 2A ) and obtained an average change in iSCAT signal during the step ( Figure 2B ) . The drop of 3 . 5% in iSCAT contrast ( ∼40% of the total signal ) suggests that the myosin head lifts on average by 24 ± 10 nm from its actin bound position . Although the precision of the measurement was in principle higher , we could not accurately determine the additional phase contributions to the interferometric signal on an individual label basis , which are required for a robust calibration . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 008Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 009 We occasionally encountered tracks where the transient state could not be localized because the iSCAT contrast dropped to zero . We interpret these cases as corresponding to molecules oriented parallel to the glass surface based on simultaneous iSCAT measurements using blue ( 445 nm ) and red ( 635 nm ) illumination . The particle remained visible in the red channel while it disappeared in the blue . At the same time , the off-axis component of the transient state was much smaller compared to those trajectories when the transient state remained visible in both channels , which is most consistent with a parallel bound molecule lifting the detached head up by ∼40 nm ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . To investigate whether subsequent steps occur on the same or opposite sides of the actin filament , commonly referred to as symmetric and asymmetric hand-over-hand stepping , ( Hua et al . , 2002 ) we labeled the two heads of a single molecule differently , one with a quantum dot and the other with a 20 nm gold particle ( Figure 3 , top ) . Simultaneous detection of quantum dot fluorescence and iSCAT signal was only possible with a longer wavelength scattering beam which is only weakly absorbed by the quantum dot , thereby avoiding excessive blinking and bleaching ( 660 vs 445 nm ) . In addition , the imaging speed was lowered to 500 frames/s to ensure <10 nm localization precision in the fluorescence channel while imaging over several seconds . We tracked both the scattering from the gold particle of one head ( upper traces in Figure 3 ) and the fluorescence of the quantum dot-labeled head ( lower traces in Figure 3 ) . In all recorded trajectories of doubly-labeled molecules that exhibited clear transient states in both the fluorescence and scattering channels , the transient states for both heads appeared on the same side of the actin filament ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 010Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 011 Close inspection of the time traces occasionally revealed what appeared to be small backwards movements of the attached head , such as the transition starting at 480 ms in the trace of Figure 1A . Since our localisation precision at 1000 frames/s is limited by the intrinsic motion of the label about its attachment point to the motor domain and diffusion of background scatterers , we repeated the tracking assay at 100 frames/s . At this imaging speed , we could frequently observe a transition between two distinct states during each 74 nm step in both an x–y projection ( Figure 4A ) and the time trace ( Figure 4B ) . As shown in the lateral trajectory , the transition between these states ( AB transition ) involves a small , <10 nm , off-axis backward motion of the gold particle attached to the bound head . As a result , the overall step size appears larger than the expected 74 nm step ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 012Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 014 The positional fluctuations ( σ = 0 . 91 nm SD ) of a surface-attached label recorded in the same field of view as the trajectory suggest that we achieved sub-nm lateral localization precision of 20 nm gold at 100 frames/s ( Figure 4B , blue ) . The localization noise increased for a gold bead attached to an actin-bound myosin ( σ = 1 . 6 ± 0 . 3 nm in Figure 4B ) , but remained small enough such that transitions on the order of 5 nm were clearly visible ( Figure 4A–B ) . The slightly larger positional fluctuations for gold bound to the actomyosin complex compared to immobilized gold were likely caused by a combination of a flexible protein-label connection and a limited ability in to completely immobilize actin . We observed a clear drop in the iSCAT contrast when the labeled trailing head detached and transitioned to the leading position ( Figure 4C ) . We also measured a much smaller change in iSCAT contrast during the AB transition , likely due to a three-dimensional reorientation of the label . We then performed simultaneous tracking of the head and the tail of myosin 5a , which showed that the small backwards transition corresponds to the power stroke of the bound motor domain . To achieve this , we labeled the myosin head with a 20 nm gold particle as previously and the tail with a GFP booster ( Ries et al . , 2012 ) . We reduced our frame rate to 20 frames/s in order to increase the fluorescence signal from the tail , since single molecule fluorescence tracking of GFP with <5 nm precision at 100 frames/s is challenging . The resulting traces showed that both the large-scale translocation of the head and the subsequent smaller backwards transition coincide with translation of the tail ( Figure 5A ) . This implies that the small-scale transition accompanies the power stroke of the attached labeled head ( AB transition ) and is representative of a pre- to post-power stroke transition ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 015Figure 5 .

( A ) Tracking of the scattering signal from the gold nanoparticle attached to the N-terminus ( black ) and fluorescence signal from the GFP moiety located at the C-terminus of the same myosin 5a molecule ( green ) . Movement of the tail correlates with the labeled head taking its step ( 74 nm displacement ) and with the AB transition ( power stroke of the labeled head ) . Green arrows represent the tail movement , which corresponds to the step of either the labelled or unlabeled head . When the unlabeled head takes its step it coincides with the AB transition within the labeled head ( red arrows ) .

ATP concentration: 1 μM . Imaging speed for both channels: 20 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 015 To determine the structural origin of the AB transition , we repeated the tracking experiments with differently sized labels . We found that the average size of the AB transition increased from 7 . 4 ± 3 . 2 nm to 9 . 5 ± 3 . 1 nm and 11 . 5 ± 2 . 5 nm for 20 , 30 and 40 nm diameter labels , respectively ( Figure 6A ) . This suggests that the AB transition reports on a conformational change of the bound head , which is a rotation of the N-terminal domain , rather than a translation of the head itself along actin . The consequences of a rotational movement of the label are presented schematically in Figure 6B . The red circles indicate the positions of two labels in the pre-power stroke A state ( with radii r1 and r2 , where r2 = 2 × r1 ) . The grey circles correspond to the post-power stroke B state . Red and grey dots indicate their respective centers . For a larger label ( r2 ) , the same movement of the N-terminus leads to an overall similar motion but with a larger displacement of the center of mass ( d2 ) than for a small label ( d1 ) . Using this model and our data , we could extract an angle of rotation , α , as well as a distance , x , that defines the origin of rotation , since sin ( α/2 ) = ½ d1/ ( r1 + x ) and d2/d1 = ( r2 + x ) / ( r1 + x ) . Using the hydrodynamic radii for the labels obtained by dynamic light scattering ( 20 , 26 and 32 nm ) , we obtained α = 20° for the angle and x = 1 . 7 nm . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 016Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 016 Trajectories recorded at 100 frames/s frequently showed both the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition , revealing that they were invariably in line ( Figure 7A , B ) . During the recording of 351 traces that exhibited clear signatures of the transient state at 100 frames/s , we found a preference ( 66% vs 33% ) of right over left-handed walking . Within individual traces , we only observed the transient state on the same side of actin . In some cases , however , we could observe individual myosin molecules switch from one actin filament to another . As previously , the transient state always appeared on one side while on one actin filament , but either switched to the other ( Figure 7C ) or remained on the same side ( Figure 7D ) of the actin track when the molecule moved from one filament to another . For 102 switching events , we found that the transient state remained on the same side of the filament 60% of the time , while changing sides in 40% of the events . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 017 Given that the transient state could always be clearly identified either to the right or to the left side of actin , we could align all recorded steps from the 1000 frames/s tracking data by flipping them about the actin filament when necessary to obtain a 2D spatial probability distribution maps of the location of both the unbound and bound myosin head compared to the actin binding sites during a single step ( Figure 8 ) . The resulting contour plot contained two maxima . For the transient state one was located ∼5 nm away from the final actin binding site and the other 40 nm off-axis from the actin filament . For the A and B states the bound head orientations were in line with the position of the transient state , with the lateral projection connecting the A , B and transient states approximately in a straight line ( see also Figure 7 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 018Figure 8 .

( A ) Contour maps of the transient state at three different ATP concentrations . Obtaining traces at high ATP concentration was challenging due to the small available field of view and rapid detachment of myosin from actin caused by the faster stepping rate .

Fitting the dwell time distribution to a single exponential yields an average lifetime of 17 . 5 ± 0 . 6 ms , independent of ATP concentration .

Dwell time distributions for pre and post-power stroke states at different ATP concentrations . In all cases , data and fits for the pre-power stroke state are shown in red; data and fits for the post-power stroke state are shown in blue . At saturating ( 1 mM ) ATP concentration ( A ) both dwell time distributions exhibited single exponential behaviour in line with ADP release being the rate limiting step . The constants for the A state dwell times are given by kA and that for the B state by kB . At lower ATP concentrations , sequential ADP release and ATP binding result in bi-exponential behaviour . At 10 μM ATP ( B ) , both kinetic constants , k1 , k2 , are almost identical therefore the dwell time distribution is fit to two sequential process with the same rate constant ( termed kA for the dwell time of the A state and kB for that of the B state ) . ( C ) At 1 μM ATP the process is limited by ATP binding . Data taken at 100 frames/s , we increased the imaging speed to 400 Hz at 1 mM ATP concentration .

Geometrical considerations assuming myosin molecules moving parallel to the glass surface . If the head searched the full spherical space , the average position would be simply about half way between the leading head and the next binding site . For a parallel orientation this would be 56 nm forward and 15 nm off axis and for a perpendicular orientation 56 nm forward but ‘in line’ with the bound head positions . These numbers arise from simple geometric considerations but also agree with much more sophisticated simulations based on a free rotational diffusion model ( Hinczewski et al . , 2013 ) . We , however , observed a transient state half way between the two binding sites , 40 nm off axis ( marked in orange ) , which rules out this geometry .

Contour map of a two-dimensional histogram with a 18 × 18 nm2 bin width was obtained using all , left- and right- handed walking traces , without flipping ( left panel ) . The resulting contour plot shows good agreement with previous results ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 022 Our ability to clearly distinguish between bound and unbound states during processive motion , allowed us to extract the dwell times of the transient state . We found that it followed a single exponential distribution with a lifetime of 17 . 5 ± 0 . 6 ms . We found no ATP concentration dependence on both the spatial and temporal distributions of the transient state within our experimental error ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . The corresponding dwell time distributions for the A and B states followed the behavior expected for processes limited by ATP binding and ADP release ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2 ) . In all cases , the dwell times of the A and the B states were identical suggesting that the 20 nm gold particle had no effect on the stepping kinetics .\nLabel-sizes of a few tens of nm are traditionally avoided in single particle tracking experiments to prevent the label from perturbing the dynamics of interest . By monitoring the lifetimes of the A and B states , which effectively provides the dwell times of the labeled and unlabeled heads , respectively , we demonstrate that the 20 nm gold particle attached to the N-terminus of myosin has no measureable effect on the kinetics of stepping . If detrimental effects can be excluded experimentally , as in this case , our results show that the larger size of the label can actually be advantageous in revealing structural dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible . Here , the label probes the structural change occurring in the bound head during the power stroke and amplifies it into a nanometer scale motion . Previous studies using gold labels were not able to observe this transition likely due to a combination of a different labeling strategy ( 40 nm or 60 nm gold nanoparticle attached to a calmodulin on the lever arm ) and much lower spatial precision ( >10 nm ) ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . Several EM studies ( Walker et al . , 2000; Burgess et al . , 2002; Oke et al . , 2010 ) failed to detect any obvious conformational differences in the position of the SH3 ( N-terminal domain ) of lead and trail heads , whereas we now demonstrate a movement of this domain associated with the power stroke taken after the trail head dissociates . This change is consistent with results of molecular dynamic simulations of both myosin 5a and myosin 2 based on crystal structures suggesting that the N-terminus undergoes a rotation during the power stroke transition ( Coureux et al . , 2003; Cecchini et al . , 2008; Preller and Holmes , 2013 ) . Although the original myosin 5 tracking performed with a fluorescently-labeled calmodulin bound to the lever arm at 1 . 5 nm precision revealed 74 nm steps , ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) a later study with rigidly attached dye labels on the calmodulin bound to the lever arm suggested that they in fact represent 64–10 nm steps ( Syed et al . , 2006 ) . During the acquisition of 4728 steps in 635 trajectories , we never observed a large followed by a small forward step . In our work , we labeled the motor domain directly , while in the previous studies , calmodulin bound to the lever arm was used as an attachment point . Since the lever arm moves significantly during the power stroke , attachment of the dye at this location may suggest a sub-step along actin , even though the motor domain itself does not move . Thus the term ‘sub step’ is inappropriate for this pattern of movement . In addition , the orientation of single dipoles can have a significant impact on the position obtained from standard Gaussian fitting and exacerbate even very small translocations ( Enderlein et al . , 2006 ) . A recent AFM study ( Kodera et al . , 2010 ) reported that detachment and reattachment of the leading head , a so-called ‘foot stomp’ contributes to the mechanochemical cycle of myosin 5 . Such behavior was also observed in the single molecule tracking study discussed above , ( Syed et al . , 2006 ) although the frequency of occurrence was not discussed in that work . The sensitivity of our tracking methodology to detachment from actin in three dimensions , however , shows that myosin remains firmly bound to actin with both heads during the mechanochemical cycle irrespective of whether the head is leading or trailing ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , except when the head takes a 74 nm step . Only on very rare occasions did we observe detachment of the leading head . Specifically , only ~3% of steps taken at 1 µM ATP , ~0 . 6% of steps taken at 10 µM ATP , none at saturating ATP exhibited this behavior . The unbinding event was not necessarily followed by reattachment at a different site suggesting that these events can be explained simply by the binding equilibria between myosin and actin , rather than being an active component of the stepping mechanism . One likely explanation for the increased occurrence of lead head detachment and reattachment in recent AFM studies ( Kodera et al . , 2010; Ando et al . , 2013 ) is the much lower ATP concentration used or the non-negligible interaction of the AFM tip with the protein . The combination of temporal and spatial precision achieved in this work directly reveals the motion of the unbound head of myosin during translocation . From the two head bound state of myosin 5a , the trailing head detaches from actin upon binding of ATP ( Figure 9A ) . The leading head then undergoes a power stroke that leans the protein forward , a motion that exhibits a strong torsional component ( Komori et al . , 2007; Ohmachi et al . , 2012 ) . After the power stroke , the unbound head arrives at a minimum in the potential energy from where it approaches the next actin binding site in what appears to be a one dimensional biased search . The transient state lifetime agrees with the duration of increased flexibility reported in optical trapping experiments probing the attachment stiffness at high time-resolution ( Veigel et al . , 2002 ) and single molecule tracking of the motor domain ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007; Beausang et al . , 2013 ) . The measured lifetime also correlates well with previously reported ensemble rate constant for the weak-to-strong binding transition ( 47 s−1 ) ( Rosenfeld and Sweeney , 2004 ) . The presence of an additional high probability density very close to the final binding site further favors such an interpretation . This density very likely corresponds to the weakly bound state from which the head frequently moves back to the side position . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 023Figure 9 . Mechanism of the myosin step . ( A ) ATP binding to the trailing head ( yellow ) and its detachment releases strain stored in the molecule . ( B ) The bound head ( black with a gold nanoparticle attached ) performs its power stroke which is accompanied by the AB transition ( inset ) . The labeled head becomes a new trailing head ( C ) which detaches after ATP binding . ( D ) It moves forward in a partially twisting motion and occupies an off axis position ( transient state ) . From this position , the head binds the desired binding site while ATP hydrolyses . ( E ) The step completes as the head binds actin and is repeated by the other head in the same direction dictated by the initial torsional strain . ( F ) Schematic representation of both heads' movement ( lateral projection ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05413 . 023 An important implication of our data is that the position of the transient state , displaced 40 nm along and perpendicular to the filament is inconsistent with a purely rotational diffusion search . In that case we would require most molecules to be bound parallel to the surface and then expect the average position of the detached head to be displaced ∼56 nm along and not more than 20 nm perpendicular to the filament ( Figure 8—figure supplement 3 ) . We emphasize however , that our data does not contradict previous dark field results , which lead to the rotational diffusion model ( Dunn and Spudich , 2007 ) . We can closely reproduce such results by adding 17 nm of localization noise to our traces . At such localization precision , left- and right- handed walking is no longer distinguishable leading to a probability density map that is no longer one-sided ( Figure 8—figure supplement 4 ) . Why the unattached head occupies a positon 40 nm away from the actin filament is a priori puzzling . There is neither an intrinsic reason for the head to pause there , nor is there a binding site present at this position . Our experimental data provides no evidence that the transient state is induced or measurably affected by unwanted interactions caused by the particle or the surface as suggested by the similarity of our transient state lifetime to previous studies with alternative labeling strategies , ( Forkey et al . , 2003; Snyder et al . , 2004; Warshaw et al . , 2005 ) the presence of the transient state for much smaller labels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) , the change in contrast during the step ( Figure 2 ) , the lack of non-specific binding of our label to the surface or actin and any localizations during the one head bound state that coincide with the underlying actin track . This location and the resulting movement , however , become more intuitive when considering that the intrinsic angle between the lever arms is similar to that found when the two heads are bound to actin , that is , ∼37 nm away from each other . Comparison of electron micrographs of myosin 5 bound to actin ( Walker et al . , 2000 ) and non-specifically bound to a surface in the absence of actin ( Takagi et al . , 2014 ) show clearly peaked angle distributions around 105 and 115° , respectively , suggesting a built-in preference for such a spatial arrangement of the two heads , rather than a truly flexible linkage , another indication that a completely free swivel at the neck-linker is unlikely . In this way , keeping the angle between the lever arms roughly intact during stepping and twisting partially about the leading head causes the translocating motor domain to preferentially reach the desired binding site . As a result a full three dimensional search mechanism is minimized to one defined by a one dimensional arc . The position of the transient state together with what appears to be constrained diffusion suggests that myosin side steps along actin in a combined twisting and leaning motion , much more like a drawing compass rather than a freely jointed swivel or human-like gait . In hindsight , such a mechanism has numerous advantages over a search based on full rotational diffusion . It generates a built-in bias for finding the correct binding site and ensures that the head needs to travel and search only along one dimension to find the desired binding site defined by the torsion about the leading head and neck linker rather than a lower probability three-dimensional Brownian search . Even if the motor domain fails to bind strongly on first passage , it swings back and forth between the transient state and the desired actin site until tight binding can occur . This suggests that the structure of myosin 5a facilitates and controls the motion of the unbound head to achieve such high specificity in finding the desired binding site . Our results do not imply that the head is effectively stationary at the transient state position while in the one head bound state . Some degree of diffusional search is inherent to the system and cannot be captured even at our low exposure time of 0 . 56 ms , which is comparable to the positional autocorrelation time we measured ( 0 . 3 ms ) , and predicted theoretically ( Craig and Linke , 2009 ) . The location of the transient state , the fact that in several thousand steps we never observed a single step with transient localizations on both sides of the actin filament , and a predominantly perpendicular orientation of myosin relative to the surface caused by our surface preparation , however , suggest that diffusion is constrained . On the contrary , we believe that this constraint is a key to myosin 5's efficiency in terms of processive motion in contrast to a completely free , spherical search space . The fact that the AB transition and the relative location of the rear-binding site and the transient state are in line has two further important implications . It suggests that the AB transition cannot solely be a consequence of a steric interaction between the label and the lever arm . In that case , we should only observe one type of AB transition , irrespective of whether right or left-handed walking occurs . Furthermore , it shows a connection between the directionality of the N-terminus and lever arm movement . The observed N-terminus domain movement could thus be a signature of the release of this strain . This conformational change , critical for rearrangement of the nucleotide binding pocket and/or closure of the internal cleft , would then allow for finalizing the actomyosin energy transduction . In other words , the energy from the ATPase reaction , stored in the actomyosin complex can only be fully used after the trailing head detaches and the system can relax . Our data shows that the AB transition is associated with the power stroke but it is unlikely that the 20° rotation of the N-terminus is directly responsible for the side step per se . The fact that the transient state is either to the left or to the right of the filament implies that it cannot be a pure consequence of the attached lever arm swing . We therefore propose that the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition reflect the strain release upon rear head detachment . The initial strain is built up within the head domain and transmitted up to the lever arm during the first binding when one of the heads twists in order to bind to the same actin filament ( Liu et al . , 2006 ) . The simultaneous tracking of the movement of both heads using the combination of gold scattering and fluorescence demonstrates that myosin walks in a symmetric manner where each head movement is accompanied by an 180° swing on the same side of the actin filament , unlike a human gait . This type of movement would imply that the cargo also rotates with each step or that a swivel exists to relieve the strain that would otherwise develop between the myosin and the cargo . Such a rotation has been measured by the orientation of quantum rods attached to the myosin 5a tail , although , in this work the source of the rotational movement was thought to be thermal ( Ohmachi et al . , 2012 ) . Our observation that the orientation of the transient state relative to actin may change for the same molecule by binding to another actin filament shows that the position of the transient state relative to actin is not an intrinsic property of individual myosin molecules . Otherwise , we would expect each molecule to preserve the orientation of the transient state even when changing from one filament to another . Instead , the decision is made upon binding to actin , with both cases following the right and left hand preference previously mentioned . With respect to the source of the symmetry breaking , one possible explanation involves the steric interaction with the surface . Depending on the initial binding angle the steric interactions with the surface would determine the direction of rotation . However , if the sidedness was only a consequence of an interaction with the surface , then we would at least expect the molecules that are bound perpendicular to the glass surface and thus have the least interaction with it , to show no preference . Since we never observed transient states on both sides of the filament during individual runs , the reported mechanism is likely to be an intrinsic feature of the myosin 5a stepping . Based on our observation that the transient state for both heads occurs on the same side of the actin filament we propose that the twisting that takes place during the initial binding event of both heads to actin determines the directionality . This initial twist , possibly driven by thermal fluctuations , establishes the direction in which the initial torsional strain is built up and is then repeatedly stored and released as the protein moves along actin . Once the directionality of the transient state has been established , both heads follow the same constrained route resulting in an efficient , unidirectional motion .\nRabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as described ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and stored in liquid nitrogen until used . A 20 μM actin stock solution was prepared in polymerisation buffer ( 10 mM imidazole , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA [pH 7 . 3] containing 1 . 7 mM DTT , 3 mM ATP ) . Actin was diluted in motility buffer ( MB; 20 mM MOPS pH 7 . 3 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM EGTA ) 20–50 times . Mouse myosin 5a HMM with a C-terminal GFP was expressed in the presence of calmodulin and purified as described ( Wang , 2000 ) . In addition , the N-terminus was modified by the addition of a nucleotide sequence encoding an AviTag peptide ( GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE ) for site-specific biotinylation with BirA ligase ( Avidity , Aurora , Colorado ) . After biotinylation , the sample was aliquoted , flash frozen in 20 μl drops and stored at −80°C . Before labeling , the myosin sample was diluted in MB containing 40 mM KCl , 5 mM DTT , 0 . 1 mg/ml BSA and 5 μM calmodulin . Gold nanoparticles of 20 nm , 30 nm and 40 nm in diameter conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from BBI ( UK ) and directly mixed with biotinylated myosin 5a sample in a 4:1 , gold to myosin ratio , consistent with one or zero myosin molecules per gold particle . The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 15 min ( sample volume 50 μl , final concentration of myosin 300 pM ) . The same procedure was used for double gold/Qdot labeling . The quantum dots ( emission maximum 565 ) conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from Invitrogen ( Lifetechnologies , UK ) . For fluorescence only imaging , myosin was incubated for 10 min with Atto-647 streptavidin ( Atto-TEC , Germany ) . The following oxygen scavenger system was used to increase the fluorescent dye stability: 0 . 2 mg/ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 4% wt/vol glucose , 0 . 04 mg/ml catalase , all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( UK ) . The flow cell was prepared as described ( Dunn and Spudich , 2011 ) . It was first rinsed with 1 mg/ml solution of poly ( ethylene glycol ) -poly-l-lysine ( PEG-PLL ) branch copolymer ( Surface Solutions SuSoS , Switzerland ) in PBS and incubated for 30 min . Next , it was washed twice with MB before adding the actin solution . After 5 min of incubation , the chamber was washed with MB and the surface was blocked by adding 1 mg/ml BSA in MB buffer . Finally , the chamber was inspected and myosin-gold conjugate solution containing ATP was added . All assays were performed at room temperature . Interferometric scattering microscopy was performed as detailed previously ( Ortega-Arroyo and Kukura , 2012 ) . For two-colour imaging a second diode laser ( 635 nm ) was overlapped with the 445 nm beam path with a dichroic mirror . In the detection arm , the images were separated by an identical optic before being imaged onto two separate CMOS cameras ( MV-D1024-160-CL-8 , Photonfocus , Switzerland ) at 333× magnification ( 31 . 8 nm/pixel ) . The incident power was adjusted to 17 . 9 kW/cm2 at the sample to achieve near-saturation of the CMOS camera , which ensured shot noise limited detection . Fluorescence only imaging and tracking was achieved with a home-built TIRF microscope using a 635 nm diode laser . The incident power was set to 5 kW/cm2 and the fluorescence imaged onto an Andor iXon3 860 EM-CCD camera at 72 . 1 nm/pixel with a 9 . 2 μm × 9 . 2 μm field of view using dielectric filters ( Thorlabs , Germany ) to separate illumination and emission . Sample-specific images with shot noise limited sensitivity were obtained by dividing the raw image by a reference flat field image . The flat field reference image containing non-sample specific illumination inhomogeneities , fixed pattern noise and any constant background caused by residual reflections was produced by first recording 2000 images while moving the sample stage with a piezo-driven XY translation stage . The resulting image stack was temporally averaged to 100 frames and each pixel of the flat field reference image was computed as the temporal median value of the frame sequence . Removal of sample specific constant background and thereby increase in the image signal to noise ratio was achieved by obtaining the static background from the sample by averaging at least 10 frames that lacked a signal from the processive myosin 5a molecule labeled with a gold nanoparticle of interest ( Ortega Arroyo et al . , 2014 ) . Nanometric tracking of labeled myosin 5a was achieved by non-linear least square fitting of the point spread function to a two-dimensional Gaussian . Spatiotemporal characterization of the transient state was achieved by alignment of several steps and separation of the states . We segmented each trajectory into step pairs defined as the set containing the data before and after each 74 nm step . These steps were detected manually by using a time interval slider along the 2D trajectory and checking for changes in positional fluctuations . The orientation of the transient state relative to actin was determined and later used to align all steps . To determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the side step only step pair traces that showed transient states lasting longer than 10 ms were used . First , we fixed the center of mass of the beginning of the step to coordinate position ( 0 , 0 ) . Then , we applied a rotation matrix to the entire step pair trace so that both bound states lie along the horizontal axis . Finally , all aligned step pair traces were overlapped to produce the contour plots shown in Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 .",
         "Cells use motor proteins that to move organelles and other cargos from one place to another . The myosins are a family of motor proteins that pull cargo along filaments made of another protein called actin . The ‘head’ end of myosin attaches to the actin filament and the ‘tail’ end binds to the cargo . The head and tail are connected by a flexible linker that allows the protein to change shape . The tails of two myosin molecules bind together to form a two-headed motor that can move along an actin filament by taking 74 nm steps . At the start of each step , both heads are attached to the actin with one in front of the other . The leading head remains attached while the rear head detaches from actin and moves in front of the leading head reattaching to actin . These movements are repeated many times to allow the motor to move along the filament , much like a tightrope walker walking along a wire . However , it is not known how the motor can move so efficiently along the actin while managing to avoid falling off its track . Here , Andrecka et al . analyzed the movement of the myosin 5 motor in real time using a method called ‘interferometric scattering microscopy’ . The experiments show that when a head detaches from the actin , it is temporarily held out to one side of the actin filament . From here , this detached head sways back and forth , until it takes a step forward and binds firmly to the next position on the filament . Both heads follow identical paths along the actin filament , and so the movement resembles the way that a drawing or dividing compass can be used to measure distances on a map . Andrecka et al . 's findings shed new light on how myosin motors move along actin . This may become a blueprint for efficient nano-mechanical motion and could therefore be important for designing artificial machines that operate on the nanoscale .",

         "By following the motion of individual heads with interferometric scattering microscopy at nm spatial and ms temporal precision we found that the detached head occupies a loosely fixed position to one side of actin from which it rebinds in a controlled manner while executing a step . Simultaneous tracking of both heads revealed that consecutive steps follow identical paths to the same side of actin in a compass-like spinning motion demonstrating a symmetrical walking pattern . These results visualize many of the critical unknown aspects of the stepping mechanism of myosin 5 including head–head coordination , the origin of lever-arm motion and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the translocating head during individual steps . Myosin 5a moves in a hand-over-hand fashion with individual heads moving by 74 nm and the center of mass by 37 nm for each step  . One of the most remarkable aspects of myosin 5a is the efficient conversion of chemical energy by the molecular-sized enzymatic heads into a translation of 74 nm along a 7 nm diameter actin filament in the presence of Brownian motion and a crowded cellular environment . Crystal structures of myosin 5a exist either with or without nucleotide , but only in the detached state  . Although these structures served as a model for the structural changes potentially induced by binding to actin ,  the internally coupled rearrangement of the subdomains leading to ADP and phosphate release or dissociation from actin upon ATP binding could only be studied in silico  . The experimental challenge in revealing such structural dynamics has been largely of spatiotemporal origin , since they are likely on the Ångstrom scale and may be very transient . Similarly , there has been considerable interest in directly revealing the motion of the individual heads as myosin steps along actin in an attempt to unravel the origins of efficient motion on the nanoscale . Single molecule studies employing optical trapping  and fluorescence imaging  have either reported periods of increased flexibility ,  or partitioning of the step into sub-events  . All resulting models involve a forward aiming power stroke followed by a Brownian search mechanism  . The power stroke of the attached head contributes only partially to the step by moving the pivot point that facilitates Brownian rotation of the unbound head . The bias towards the next binding site is believed to be provided by the recovery stroke and its stability , but how unidirectional stepping is achieved in the presence of such a large and mostly random motion remains unclear  . The first passage time of the translocating head is expected to be on the order of 100 µs ,  although the head spends tens of ms in the unbound state given the maximum rates of ATP hydrolysis and binding to actin  . Optical trapping operates in this spatiotemporal regime , but it is not possible to monitor the motion of the unattached head without significant perturbation . Smaller labels affixed to the myosin motor domain or to calmodulin molecules on the lever arm , as available in fluorescence imaging , do not suffer from this limitation , but cannot provide sufficient localization precision on the millisecond time scale . We therefore designed an assay based on interferometric scattering microscopy  ,  a technique that has recently been shown to enable simultaneous high-speed and high-precision imaging of 20 nm diameter or smaller nanoscale scattering labels  . We attached a 20 nm gold label functioning as an efficient light scatterer to the N-terminus of the myosin 5 head and tracked its motion as the motor travels along actin filaments  . From the centre of mass of the signal produced by the label , we determined the position of the head as a function of time revealing discrete 74 nm steps at 1000 frames/s imaging speed with ∼4 nm positional precision  . We verified that the addition of the 20 nm label did not interfere with the mechano–chemical cycle of myosin 5a by characterizing the speed of movement at different ATP concentrations . Our results compare well with those from a series of other single molecule studies where the molecule was labeled on the lever arm , the tail , or attached to a surface  . Distance traveled as a function of time for a single myosin 5 molecule biotinylated at the N-terminus and labeled with a 20 nm streptavidin-functionalized gold particle . The lateral localisation precision , σ , defined as the standard deviation of the positional fluctuations of the label while bound to actin is given above each of the actin-attached periods .

DOI: http://dx . Representative time trace segment of an event in which the leading head detaches from the actin filament and exhibits the intermediate state behaviour reported in the main text . DOI: http://dx . This file contains the iSCAT video from which the trajectory shown in Figure 1 of the main manuscript was obtained . The flat field accounts for illumination inhomogeneities and was generated as described in the Materials and Methods section . The right panel shows the static background subtracted video format . The background includes the average of 100 frames before the particle binds and removes the constant features which are part of the sample  by simple subtraction  . 007 In addition to the expected 74 nm steps , we observed periods of increased positional fluctuations between detachment and reattachment of the labeled head , previously interpreted as a signature of Brownian search  . Our effective lateral localization precision of 4 nm at 1000 frames/s , however , enabled us to visualize the motion of the unbound head precisely and revealed a transient state with a center of mass just over half way between the two binding sites and offset by 40 nm perpendicular to the actin filament  . From this position , the myosin head repeatedly moved back and forth between the next actin binding site and the transient state position  . On the rare occasions that the labelled leading head of myosin detached and reattached , it occupied a similar position in space to a translocating head  , suggesting that the transient state represents a true potential minimum of the one head bound state of myosin . In addition to providing nanometer precise information on the lateral position of the head through the center of mass of the signal , the iSCAT signal magnitude is very sensitive to the label-to-surface distance allowing for overall nanometric localization in three-dimensions  . This property arises from the interferometric nature of the technique , which scales the iSCAT signal as sinΦ , where Φ is the phase difference between scattered and reflected light fields . As the label moves perpendicular to the sample plane , the optical path length and with it the phase difference between the two fields changes by the following relation Φ = 4πηz/λ  . A complete signal inversion occurs for a displacement of z = λ/4η = 84 nm , where λ is the illumination wavelength  and η the refractive index of the medium  . Thus , variations in the axial distance of the motor domain with respect to the filament bound to the sample surface lead to changes in the scattering contrast . We often observed these changes in contrast between the actin bound and unbound states  and obtained an average change in iSCAT signal during the step  . 5% in iSCAT contrast  suggests that the myosin head lifts on average by 24 ± 10 nm from its actin bound position . Although the precision of the measurement was in principle higher , we could not accurately determine the additional phase contributions to the interferometric signal on an individual label basis , which are required for a robust calibration . DOI: http://dx . Dual colour iSCAT imaging of myosin 5 . Although the latter channel exhibits higher noise due to a lower scattering signal , the transient state is evident in every step even though much of the data are lost in the trace recorded at 445 nm due to the major drop in scattering intensity . Imaging speed: 1000 frames/s . DOI: http://dx . We interpret these cases as corresponding to molecules oriented parallel to the glass surface based on simultaneous iSCAT measurements using blue  and red  illumination . At the same time , the off-axis component of the transient state was much smaller compared to those trajectories when the transient state remained visible in both channels , which is most consistent with a parallel bound molecule lifting the detached head up by ∼40 nm  . To investigate whether subsequent steps occur on the same or opposite sides of the actin filament , commonly referred to as symmetric and asymmetric hand-over-hand stepping ,  we labeled the two heads of a single molecule differently , one with a quantum dot and the other with a 20 nm gold particle  . In addition , the imaging speed was lowered to 500 frames/s to ensure <10 nm localization precision in the fluorescence channel while imaging over several seconds . In all recorded trajectories of doubly-labeled molecules that exhibited clear transient states in both the fluorescence and scattering channels , the transient states for both heads appeared on the same side of the actin filament  . Simultaneous scattering and fluorescence tracking of a single myosin 5a . The traces are colored according to the label colors in the inset . ATP concentration: 10 μM . org/10 . 011 Close inspection of the time traces occasionally revealed what appeared to be small backwards movements of the attached head , such as the transition starting at 480 ms in the trace of Figure 1A . Since our localisation precision at 1000 frames/s is limited by the intrinsic motion of the label about its attachment point to the motor domain and diffusion of background scatterers , we repeated the tracking assay at 100 frames/s . At this imaging speed , we could frequently observe a transition between two distinct states during each 74 nm step in both an x–y projection  and the time trace  . As shown in the lateral trajectory , the transition between these states  involves a small , <10 nm , off-axis backward motion of the gold particle attached to the bound head .

Data was collected at 100 Hz and 10 μM ATP , using 20 nm diameter gold nanoparticles . The positional fluctuations of the A and B states presented as histograms of lateral localization precision , σ , show no measurable difference in mechanical stability of the two states . 8 nm/pixel . The corresponding field of view shown is 2 × 2 μm2 and corresponds to a total recording time of 5 s . DOI: http://dx . 014 The positional fluctuations  of a surface-attached label recorded in the same field of view as the trajectory suggest that we achieved sub-nm lateral localization precision of 20 nm gold at 100 frames/s  . The slightly larger positional fluctuations for gold bound to the actomyosin complex compared to immobilized gold were likely caused by a combination of a flexible protein-label connection and a limited ability in to completely immobilize actin . We also measured a much smaller change in iSCAT contrast during the AB transition , likely due to a three-dimensional reorientation of the label . We then performed simultaneous tracking of the head and the tail of myosin 5a , which showed that the small backwards transition corresponds to the power stroke of the bound motor domain . We reduced our frame rate to 20 frames/s in order to increase the fluorescence signal from the tail , since single molecule fluorescence tracking of GFP with <5 nm precision at 100 frames/s is challenging . The resulting traces showed that both the large-scale translocation of the head and the subsequent smaller backwards transition coincide with translation of the tail  . Green arrows represent the tail movement , which corresponds to the step of either the labelled or unlabeled head . 015 To determine the structural origin of the AB transition , we repeated the tracking experiments with differently sized labels . We found that the average size of the AB transition increased from 7 . The red circles indicate the positions of two labels in the pre-power stroke A state  . The grey circles correspond to the post-power stroke B state . Red and grey dots indicate their respective centers . For a larger label  , the same movement of the N-terminus leads to an overall similar motion but with a larger displacement of the center of mass  than for a small label  . Using this model and our data , we could extract an angle of rotation , α , as well as a distance , x , that defines the origin of rotation , since sin  = ½ d1/  and d2/d1 =  /  . Using the hydrodynamic radii for the labels obtained by dynamic light scattering  , we obtained α = 20° for the angle and x = 1 .

The red circle represents the position of the label in the A state , and the grey circle corresponds to the B state with dots indicating their respective centres of mass . The myosin 5a head domain pre-power stroke conformation is shown in orange  . The lever arm is pointing out  and the blue arrow indicates its movement during the power stroke . 016 Trajectories recorded at 100 frames/s frequently showed both the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition , revealing that they were invariably in line  . During the recording of 351 traces that exhibited clear signatures of the transient state at 100 frames/s , we found a preference  of right over left-handed walking . Within individual traces , we only observed the transient state on the same side of actin . In some cases , however , we could observe individual myosin molecules switch from one actin filament to another . As previously , the transient state always appeared on one side while on one actin filament , but either switched to the other  or remained on the same side  of the actin track when the molecule moved from one filament to another . For 102 switching events , we found that the transient state remained on the same side of the filament 60% of the time , while changing sides in 40% of the events . Simultaneous observation of the AB transition and the transient state for right and left handed walking molecules . Position of the transient state for the same molecule before and after switching actin tracks . DOI: http://dx . org/10 . 017 Given that the transient state could always be clearly identified either to the right or to the left side of actin , we could align all recorded steps from the 1000 frames/s tracking data by flipping them about the actin filament when necessary to obtain a 2D spatial probability distribution maps of the location of both the unbound and bound myosin head compared to the actin binding sites during a single step  . The resulting contour plot contained two maxima . For the transient state one was located ∼5 nm away from the final actin binding site and the other 40 nm off-axis from the actin filament . Upper panel represents the transient state of the unbound head . Contour map of a two-dimensional histogram with a 10 × 10 nm2 bin width obtained from the 1000 frames/s data  . Lower panel shows the AB transition within the bound head , a two-dimensional histogram with a 1 × 1 nm2 bin width generated using the 100 frames/s data  . All contributing steps were aligned and those to the right of the filament when viewed in the direction of motion were mirrored . DOI: http://dx .

Dwell time histograms at three different ATP concentrations  . Fitting the dwell time distribution to a single exponential yields an average lifetime of 17 . DOI: http://dx . Dwell time distributions for pre and post-power stroke states at different ATP concentrations . In all cases , data and fits for the pre-power stroke state are shown in red; data and fits for the post-power stroke state are shown in blue . The constants for the A state dwell times are given by kA and that for the B state by kB . At lower ATP concentrations , sequential ADP release and ATP binding result in bi-exponential behaviour . At 10 μM ATP  , both kinetic constants , k1 , k2 , are almost identical therefore the dwell time distribution is fit to two sequential process with the same rate constant  . Data taken at 100 frames/s , we increased the imaging speed to 400 Hz at 1 mM ATP concentration . Total number of steps recorded: 110 , 245 and 104 , for 1 μM , 10 μM and 1 mM , respectively . If the head searched the full spherical space , the average position would be simply about half way between the leading head and the next binding site . For a parallel orientation this would be 56 nm forward and 15 nm off axis and for a perpendicular orientation 56 nm forward but ‘in line’ with the bound head positions . These numbers arise from simple geometric considerations but also agree with much more sophisticated simulations based on a free rotational diffusion model  . We , however , observed a transient state half way between the two binding sites , 40 nm off axis  , which rules out this geometry . Contour map of a two-dimensional histogram with a 18 × 18 nm2 bin width was obtained using all , left- and right- handed walking traces , without flipping  . The resulting contour plot shows good agreement with previous results  . We found no ATP concentration dependence on both the spatial and temporal distributions of the transient state within our experimental error  . The corresponding dwell time distributions for the A and B states followed the behavior expected for processes limited by ATP binding and ADP release  . In all cases , the dwell times of the A and the B states were identical suggesting that the 20 nm gold particle had no effect on the stepping kinetics . Label-sizes of a few tens of nm are traditionally avoided in single particle tracking experiments to prevent the label from perturbing the dynamics of interest . If detrimental effects can be excluded experimentally , as in this case , our results show that the larger size of the label can actually be advantageous in revealing structural dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible . Previous studies using gold labels were not able to observe this transition likely due to a combination of a different labeling strategy  and much lower spatial precision   . Several EM studies  failed to detect any obvious conformational differences in the position of the SH3  of lead and trail heads , whereas we now demonstrate a movement of this domain associated with the power stroke taken after the trail head dissociates . This change is consistent with results of molecular dynamic simulations of both myosin 5a and myosin 2 based on crystal structures suggesting that the N-terminus undergoes a rotation during the power stroke transition  . 5 nm precision revealed 74 nm steps ,  a later study with rigidly attached dye labels on the calmodulin bound to the lever arm suggested that they in fact represent 64–10 nm steps  . During the acquisition of 4728 steps in 635 trajectories , we never observed a large followed by a small forward step . In our work , we labeled the motor domain directly , while in the previous studies , calmodulin bound to the lever arm was used as an attachment point . Since the lever arm moves significantly during the power stroke , attachment of the dye at this location may suggest a sub-step along actin , even though the motor domain itself does not move . Such behavior was also observed in the single molecule tracking study discussed above ,  although the frequency of occurrence was not discussed in that work . The sensitivity of our tracking methodology to detachment from actin in three dimensions , however , shows that myosin remains firmly bound to actin with both heads during the mechanochemical cycle irrespective of whether the head is leading or trailing  , except when the head takes a 74 nm step . The unbinding event was not necessarily followed by reattachment at a different site suggesting that these events can be explained simply by the binding equilibria between myosin and actin , rather than being an active component of the stepping mechanism . One likely explanation for the increased occurrence of lead head detachment and reattachment in recent AFM studies  is the much lower ATP concentration used or the non-negligible interaction of the AFM tip with the protein . The combination of temporal and spatial precision achieved in this work directly reveals the motion of the unbound head of myosin during translocation . From the two head bound state of myosin 5a , the trailing head detaches from actin upon binding of ATP  . The leading head then undergoes a power stroke that leans the protein forward , a motion that exhibits a strong torsional component  . After the power stroke , the unbound head arrives at a minimum in the potential energy from where it approaches the next actin binding site in what appears to be a one dimensional biased search . The transient state lifetime agrees with the duration of increased flexibility reported in optical trapping experiments probing the attachment stiffness at high time-resolution  and single molecule tracking of the motor domain  . The measured lifetime also correlates well with previously reported ensemble rate constant for the weak-to-strong binding transition   . The presence of an additional high probability density very close to the final binding site further favors such an interpretation . ATP binding to the trailing head  and its detachment releases strain stored in the molecule . The bound head  performs its power stroke which is accompanied by the AB transition  . The labeled head becomes a new trailing head  which detaches after ATP binding . The step completes as the head binds actin and is repeated by the other head in the same direction dictated by the initial torsional strain . DOI: http://dx . 023 An important implication of our data is that the position of the transient state , displaced 40 nm along and perpendicular to the filament is inconsistent with a purely rotational diffusion search . In that case we would require most molecules to be bound parallel to the surface and then expect the average position of the detached head to be displaced ∼56 nm along and not more than 20 nm perpendicular to the filament  . We emphasize however , that our data does not contradict previous dark field results , which lead to the rotational diffusion model  . We can closely reproduce such results by adding 17 nm of localization noise to our traces . At such localization precision , left- and right- handed walking is no longer distinguishable leading to a probability density map that is no longer one-sided  . Why the unattached head occupies a positon 40 nm away from the actin filament is a priori puzzling . There is neither an intrinsic reason for the head to pause there , nor is there a binding site present at this position . Our experimental data provides no evidence that the transient state is induced or measurably affected by unwanted interactions caused by the particle or the surface as suggested by the similarity of our transient state lifetime to previous studies with alternative labeling strategies ,  the presence of the transient state for much smaller labels  , the change in contrast during the step  , the lack of non-specific binding of our label to the surface or actin and any localizations during the one head bound state that coincide with the underlying actin track . This location and the resulting movement , however , become more intuitive when considering that the intrinsic angle between the lever arms is similar to that found when the two heads are bound to actin , that is , ∼37 nm away from each other . Comparison of electron micrographs of myosin 5 bound to actin  and non-specifically bound to a surface in the absence of actin  show clearly peaked angle distributions around 105 and 115° , respectively , suggesting a built-in preference for such a spatial arrangement of the two heads , rather than a truly flexible linkage , another indication that a completely free swivel at the neck-linker is unlikely . In this way , keeping the angle between the lever arms roughly intact during stepping and twisting partially about the leading head causes the translocating motor domain to preferentially reach the desired binding site . As a result a full three dimensional search mechanism is minimized to one defined by a one dimensional arc . The position of the transient state together with what appears to be constrained diffusion suggests that myosin side steps along actin in a combined twisting and leaning motion , much more like a drawing compass rather than a freely jointed swivel or human-like gait . In hindsight , such a mechanism has numerous advantages over a search based on full rotational diffusion . It generates a built-in bias for finding the correct binding site and ensures that the head needs to travel and search only along one dimension to find the desired binding site defined by the torsion about the leading head and neck linker rather than a lower probability three-dimensional Brownian search . Even if the motor domain fails to bind strongly on first passage , it swings back and forth between the transient state and the desired actin site until tight binding can occur . This suggests that the structure of myosin 5a facilitates and controls the motion of the unbound head to achieve such high specificity in finding the desired binding site . Our results do not imply that the head is effectively stationary at the transient state position while in the one head bound state . Some degree of diffusional search is inherent to the system and cannot be captured even at our low exposure time of 0 . 56 ms , which is comparable to the positional autocorrelation time we measured  , and predicted theoretically  . The location of the transient state , the fact that in several thousand steps we never observed a single step with transient localizations on both sides of the actin filament , and a predominantly perpendicular orientation of myosin relative to the surface caused by our surface preparation , however , suggest that diffusion is constrained . On the contrary , we believe that this constraint is a key to myosin 5's efficiency in terms of processive motion in contrast to a completely free , spherical search space . The fact that the AB transition and the relative location of the rear-binding site and the transient state are in line has two further important implications . In that case , we should only observe one type of AB transition , irrespective of whether right or left-handed walking occurs . Furthermore , it shows a connection between the directionality of the N-terminus and lever arm movement . The observed N-terminus domain movement could thus be a signature of the release of this strain . This conformational change , critical for rearrangement of the nucleotide binding pocket and/or closure of the internal cleft , would then allow for finalizing the actomyosin energy transduction . In other words , the energy from the ATPase reaction , stored in the actomyosin complex can only be fully used after the trailing head detaches and the system can relax . Our data shows that the AB transition is associated with the power stroke but it is unlikely that the 20° rotation of the N-terminus is directly responsible for the side step per se . We therefore propose that the position of the transient state and the direction of the AB transition reflect the strain release upon rear head detachment . The initial strain is built up within the head domain and transmitted up to the lever arm during the first binding when one of the heads twists in order to bind to the same actin filament  . The simultaneous tracking of the movement of both heads using the combination of gold scattering and fluorescence demonstrates that myosin walks in a symmetric manner where each head movement is accompanied by an 180° swing on the same side of the actin filament , unlike a human gait . Our observation that the orientation of the transient state relative to actin may change for the same molecule by binding to another actin filament shows that the position of the transient state relative to actin is not an intrinsic property of individual myosin molecules . Otherwise , we would expect each molecule to preserve the orientation of the transient state even when changing from one filament to another . Instead , the decision is made upon binding to actin , with both cases following the right and left hand preference previously mentioned . With respect to the source of the symmetry breaking , one possible explanation involves the steric interaction with the surface . However , if the sidedness was only a consequence of an interaction with the surface , then we would at least expect the molecules that are bound perpendicular to the glass surface and thus have the least interaction with it , to show no preference . Since we never observed transient states on both sides of the filament during individual runs , the reported mechanism is likely to be an intrinsic feature of the myosin 5a stepping . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared as described  and stored in liquid nitrogen until used . Gold nanoparticles of 20 nm , 30 nm and 40 nm in diameter conjugated with streptavidin were purchased from BBI  and directly mixed with biotinylated myosin 5a sample in a 4:1 , gold to myosin ratio , consistent with one or zero myosin molecules per gold particle . The same procedure was used for double gold/Qdot labeling . The following oxygen scavenger system was used to increase the fluorescent dye stability: 0 . The flow cell was prepared as described  . It was first rinsed with 1 mg/ml solution of poly  -poly-l-lysine  branch copolymer  in PBS and incubated for 30 min . After 5 min of incubation , the chamber was washed with MB and the surface was blocked by adding 1 mg/ml BSA in MB buffer . Finally , the chamber was inspected and myosin-gold conjugate solution containing ATP was added . All assays were performed at room temperature . Interferometric scattering microscopy was performed as detailed previously  . For two-colour imaging a second diode laser  was overlapped with the 445 nm beam path with a dichroic mirror . In the detection arm , the images were separated by an identical optic before being imaged onto two separate CMOS cameras  at 333× magnification  . 9 kW/cm2 at the sample to achieve near-saturation of the CMOS camera , which ensured shot noise limited detection . Fluorescence only imaging and tracking was achieved with a home-built TIRF microscope using a 635 nm diode laser . The incident power was set to 5 kW/cm2 and the fluorescence imaged onto an Andor iXon3 860 EM-CCD camera at 72 . 2 μm field of view using dielectric filters  to separate illumination and emission . Sample-specific images with shot noise limited sensitivity were obtained by dividing the raw image by a reference flat field image . The flat field reference image containing non-sample specific illumination inhomogeneities , fixed pattern noise and any constant background caused by residual reflections was produced by first recording 2000 images while moving the sample stage with a piezo-driven XY translation stage . The resulting image stack was temporally averaged to 100 frames and each pixel of the flat field reference image was computed as the temporal median value of the frame sequence . Removal of sample specific constant background and thereby increase in the image signal to noise ratio was achieved by obtaining the static background from the sample by averaging at least 10 frames that lacked a signal from the processive myosin 5a molecule labeled with a gold nanoparticle of interest  . Nanometric tracking of labeled myosin 5a was achieved by non-linear least square fitting of the point spread function to a two-dimensional Gaussian . We segmented each trajectory into step pairs defined as the set containing the data before and after each 74 nm step . These steps were detected manually by using a time interval slider along the 2D trajectory and checking for changes in positional fluctuations . The orientation of the transient state relative to actin was determined and later used to align all steps . To determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the side step only step pair traces that showed transient states lasting longer than 10 ms were used . Then , we applied a rotation matrix to the entire step pair trace so that both bound states lie along the horizontal axis . Finally , all aligned step pair traces were overlapped to produce the contour plots shown in Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1 . "

         "The latent reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure . As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly , the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive . Here , we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states . Our results suggest that , contrary to common assumptions , the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets , and is remarkably conserved between individuals . However , reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood , as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents . By selecting 8–10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers , we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells . These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus , transcribed HIV , and displayed clonal expansion . The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence .\nCombination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) suppresses HIV replication but does not eliminate the latent reservoir , which persists for decades in CD4+ T cells and forms a major barrier to HIV cure ( Chun et al . , 1997; Finzi et al . , 1997; Wong et al . , 1997 ) . Our understanding of the phenotypic features of latent cells in vivo is limited , in large part because the lack of a universal surface biomarker makes it impossible to directly identify these cells . As a result , fundamental questions remain , such as whether latent cells distribute equally among all CD4+ T cell subsets , and to what extent the reservoir is similar between individuals and between blood and tissues . In the absence of direct ways to phenotype latent cells , characterizing the composition of the HIV reservoir has largely entailed sorting CD4+ T cells based on predefined sets of cell-surface proteins , followed by quantitating HIV through a variety of methods . A vast majority of infected cells in virally suppressed individuals harbor defective HIV genomes ( Hiener et al . , 2017; Ho et al . , 2013; Imamichi et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . Older quantitation methods based on measuring total HIV DNA/RNA levels , regardless of provirus integrity , are being replaced with methods quantitating levels of replication-competent or genome-intact provirus . These methods afford a more accurate picture of the cells leading to viral rebound during treatment interruption , which are the most relevant targets for HIV cure . The ‘gold standard’ in virus quantitation has been the quantitative viral outgrowth assay ( qVOA; Finzi et al . , 1997 ) . qVOA has not identified significant differences in the amount of replication-competent HIV in the most commonly studied subsets of memory CD4+ T cells – central memory ( Tcm ) , effector memory ( Tem ) , and transitional memory ( Ttm ) ( Buzon et al . , 2014; Kwon et al . , 2020 ) . Such observations have led many researchers to consider the replication-competent reservoir as equally residing in all cell subsets , which if true makes targeting it more difficult . The analysis of proviral sequences , on the other hand , has revealed differences in the frequencies of genome-intact provirus in different sorted subsets . For instance , sequencing of near full-length HIV provirus has identified Th1 and Tem , particularly those that are HLADR+ , as subsets preferentially harboring intact viral genomes ( Hiener et al . , 2017; Horsburgh et al . , 2020; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . Viral sequencing has also revealed many intact proviruses within clonally expanded populations , particularly within the Tem and Th1 subsets , and those expressing Ox40 or CD161 ( De Scheerder et al . , 2019; Hiener et al . , 2017; Kuo et al . , 2018; Lee et al . , 2017; Li et al . , 2019 ) . These and many other studies ( Cohn et al . , 2020; Liu et al . , 2020 ) have solidified the view that clonal expansion plays a major role in maintaining the long-lived HIV reservoir . Although analyses of sorted populations have provided meaningful insights into HIV persistence , they have been limited to comparing cell populations that differ in one or two markers . Thus , they do not provide a comprehensive view of the phenotypic features of latent cells . Several methods have recently enabled the direct phenotyping of reservoir cells at single-cell resolution ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Cohn et al . , 2018; Grau-Expósito et al . , 2017; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) , providing deeper analyses of the reservoir . These methods entail stimulating cells from ART-suppressed patients with a mitogen to induce the expression of HIV RNA and/or proteins , which serve as markers for identifying or isolating cells using FACS . However , one important limitation with these methods is that they require ex vivo stimulation before phenotyping as viral proteins are not typically expressed at detectable levels in unstimulated latent cells ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Cohn et al . , 2018; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) . This stimulation will induce phenotypic changes associated with T cell activation , and expression of HIV accessory genes from reactivation will result in host cell remodeling ( e . g . downregulation of cell-surface CD4 ) , which will further alter the phenotypes of the cells ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , although current methods enable phenotyping of reactivated cells , there is at present no methodology to directly assess the phenotypes of individual latent cells in their original dormant state . To overcome this limitation , we applied the principles behind Predicted Precursor as determined by SLIDE ( PP-SLIDE ) , an analytic method we recently established that combines high-dimensional single-cell phenotyping and computational approaches . We have used PP-SLIDE to predict the state of CD4+ T cells before phenotypic changes induced by productive HIV infection ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Here , we applied it to determine the features of in vivo latent CD4+ T cells before their reactivation by ex vivo stimulation , and validated these findings with patient specimens . Through PP-SLIDE analysis , we were able to address questions fundamental to our understanding of HIV latency and to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent latent cells for mechanistic studies of reservoir maintenance .\nPP-SLIDE was recently validated as an approach to trace HIV-remodeled cells to their original pre-infection states ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . To determine if it can trace reactivated cells to their original latent state , we tested it first in J-Lat cells , an in vitro model of HIV latency . J-Lat cells are Jurkat cells harboring a single integrated HIV provirus that can be reactivated upon stimulation . Multiple lines of J-Lats have been cloned ( Chan et al . , 2013; Jordan et al . , 2003 ) that have diverged slightly over successive passages . We tested how well PP-SLIDE traces reactivated cells back to their original clone when given the choice of two parental clones ( Figure 1A ) . Cells of clone 6 . 3 were reactivated by stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and phenotyped using a CyTOF T cell panel ( Ma et al . , 2020 ) , along with unstimulated cells of clone 6 . 3 and another clone 5A8 . Using PP-SLIDE ( see Materials and methods ) , the high-dimensional CyTOF-generated information from reactivated 6 . 3 cells ( identified by expression of HIV Gag ) was matched against an atlas of concatenated unstimulated 5A8 and 6 . 3 cells to identify the most similar unstimulated cell for each reactivated 6 . 3 cell . These unstimulated cells , identified using a k-nearest neighbor ( kNN ) approach , are collectively termed ‘kNN latent cells’ . The error rate , defined as the % of reactivated 6 . 3 cells that matched to unstimulated 5A8 cells , was 0 . 8% ( Figure 1B ) . These results suggest that although reactivation greatly changes the phenotype of a latent cell , some of the original ‘identity’ of the cell is still retained and that PP-SLIDE can be used to capture this information and thereby identify precursors of reactivated latent cells . Next , we applied PP-SLIDE to characterize latent cells from HIV-infected individuals , using a CyTOF panel ( Supplementary file 1 ) that is directed at markers of the major subsets and differentiation states of CD4+ T cells and includes receptors and intracellular proteins associated with latency ( Banga et al . , 2016; Buzon et al . , 2014; Chomont et al . , 2009; Descours et al . , 2017; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Hogan et al . , 2018; Iglesias-Ussel et al . , 2013; Khoury et al . , 2016; Li et al . , 2019; Serra-Peinado et al . , 2019; Sun et al . , 2015 ) . Since reactivation events are rare and reducing background was key , we conjugated different anti-Gag antibodies to three different metal lanthanides and only considered cells displaying a Gag signal in all three channels as true events . The full panel was validated in vitro ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We collected via leukapheresis CD4+ T cells from the blood of four ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals ( Supplementary file 2 ) , purified memory CD4+ T cells by negative selection , and separated the cells into two pools ( Figure 2A ) . One pool was used to generate the atlas of unstimulated cells . This pool was phenotyped within 2 hours of cell isolation , and never went through any cryopreservation or ex vivo culture . The other pool was stimulated with PMA/ionomycin under fully suppressive ART ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) for 40 hr , a time point that precedes mitogen-induced cellular proliferation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) . The CyTOF profiles of reactivated cells were matched against those of the unstimulated atlas cells . Assuming each reactivated cell retained some of its original pre-stimulation identity and that a phenotypically similar cell was present in the atlas of unstimulated cells , we used PP-SLIDE to identify , for each reactivated cell , the nearest-neighbor within the atlas ( Figure 2A ) . These identified cells , the ‘kNN latent cells’ , harbor the predicted phenotypes of latent cells before their reactivation from latency . We identified between 20 and 96 reactivated cells per specimen , corresponding to a mean frequency of 11 . 3 per million memory ( CD45RA-CD45RO+ ) CD4+ T cells ( range 5 . 6–17 . 6 , Figure 2B , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . When visualized against the atlas of unstimulated cells by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( tSNE; van der Maaten , 2009 ) , Gag+ reactivated cells occupied a unique region , confirming their distinct phenotype relative to unstimulated cells ( Figure 2C , left ) . kNN latent cells mapped to several distinct regions of the atlas ( Figure 2C , right ) , suggesting a non-random distribution among memory CD4+ T cells . To verify this , we implemented FlowSOM ( Van Gassen et al . , 2015 ) to subdivide the atlases from each of the four donors into 20 clusters , and visualized the distribution of kNN latent cells on the tSNE maps or on pie graphs ( Figure 2C , center , and 2D ) . We found large clusters lacking kNN latent cells as well as small clusters harboring kNN latent cells , consistent with a non-random distribution of latent cells , which was confirmed using a chi-squared test ( Figure 2D ) . For a detailed description of the extent of enrichment of kNN latent cells in clusters and validation of non-random distribution of the reservoir , see Materials and methods . Next , we examined the composition of the kNN latent cells . We focused first on the Tcm , Tem , and Ttm subsets , as they have been the most commonly studied memory CD4+ T cells in the context of HIV latency ( Chomont et al . , 2009; Josefsson et al . , 2013; Kwon et al . , 2020; Pardons et al . , 2019; Soriano-Sarabia et al . , 2014; von Stockenstrom et al . , 2015 ) . In all four donors , the contribution of Tem to the reservoir was greater than its contribution to total memory CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We did not identify any kNN latent cells with the Ttm phenotype , likely because this subset is relatively rare in blood and not efficiently captured in our samples , each of which harbored fewer than 100 kNN latent cells . When the three FlowSOM clusters of atlas cells with the highest frequencies of kNN latent cells were examined for the relative contributions of the Tcm , Tem , and Ttm subsets , we found that they were all comprised of multiple subsets ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that although Tem are over-represented among kNN latent cells , the clusters most enriched for kNN latent cells – as classified by unbiased clustering based on ~40 markers – are a mixture of Tcm/Tem/Ttm subsets . These findings could suggest that the reservoir is quite different between individuals . Alternatively , they could mean that latency markers shared between individuals are not those used to define Tcm/Tem/Ttm cells . Consistent with the latter , when datasets from the four donors were combined and re-run within the same tSNE , the kNN latent cells from the four donors resided within a similar region of the plot ( Figure 3A ) . These results argue that kNN latent cells between different donors are in fact similar . Consistent with this conclusion , relative to total memory CD4+ T cells , kNN latent cells consistently expressed higher levels of select markers of immune checkpoint ( PD1 , CTLA4 ) , activation ( CD69 , CD25 , HLADR ) , and T cell differentiation states ( Tbet , CRTH2 , CCR6; Figure 3B ) . We conclude that in vivo latent cells are not randomly distributed but instead share specific features between individuals . Even though latent cells are similar between individuals , the inter-donor variability in latent cells could still be greater than the intra-donor variability . To test this idea , we obtained leukapheresis specimens from donor PID5003 at two time points spaced 2 months apart and compared in an unbiased manner the kNN latent cells from those specimens to kNN latent cells from donor PID3010 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A , B ) . For each kNN latent cell in the PID3010 sample , we calculated the Euclidean distances ( based on CyTOF parameters ) to every kNN latent cell in the PID5003 sample . Similar calculations were conducted between kNN latent cells from the two time points sampled in PID5003 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) . The median distances were lower between specimens from the same donor than from different donors ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3C ) , demonstrating that despite the similarity of kNN latent cells between donors , the kNN latent cells differ more between donors than within a donor . Next , we took advantage of our ability to obtain high-resolution maps of the phenotypic features of latent cells to compare their reactivation by different ex vivo stimulations . Longitudinal blood specimens were obtained from the same suppressed individual and stimulated with the broad-spectrum mitogens PMA/ionomycin or anti-CD3/CD28 . Euclidean distance calculations ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) revealed that PMA/ionomycin-reactivatable kNN latent cells from different collection time points were more similar to each other than to anti-CD3/CD28-reactivatable kNN latent cells from the same time point ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3D , E ) . Next , we compared the latent cells reactivatable by PMA/ionomycin to those reactivatable by a combination LRA consisting of an HDAC inhibitor together with an ingenol ( Romdepsin/PEP005 ) using three longitudinal blood specimens each spaced 2 months apart . tSNE visualization of the kNN latent cells revealed a region of the plot that harbored kNN latent cells from the PMA/ionomycin samples but not from the Romidepsin/PEP005 samples ( Figure 4A ) . Euclidean distance calculations ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) were again used to verify that kNN latent cells reactivatable by the same stimulation at different time points were more similar than those reactivatable by different stimulations within the same time point ( Figure 4B ) . These data suggest that Romdepsin/PEP005 reactivates only a subset of latent cells reactivatable by broad-spectrum mitogens such as PMA/ionomycin , although these findings should be confirmed with longitudinal specimens from additional donors . Since most of the HIV reservoir persists within tissues ( Estes et al . , 2017 ) , we next applied the PP-SLIDE method of latent cell characterization to tissue specimens . One of the four suppressed participants who had donated a leukapheresis specimen , PID3010 , also agreed to the collection of two sets of lymph node specimens via fine needle aspirates ( FNAs ) spaced 6 months apart . Upon isolation , each FNA was immediately mock-treated or stimulated for 40 hr with PMA/ionomycin and then subjected to PP-SLIDE . Unlike with blood specimens , memory CD4+ T cells were not purified ahead of time since FNAs yielded limited numbers of cells . However , we pre-gated on memory CD4+ T cells to compare with purified blood cells . The atlases from the three specimens ( one blood , two FNAs ) showed that blood and FNA cells were phenotypically distinct ( Figure 4C ) . The kNN latent cells from the FNAs , similar to those from blood , were not randomly distributed and remained similar across the longitudinal specimens as demonstrated by their occupying similar regions of tSNE space ( Figure 4C ) . Several antigens distinguished kNN latent cells in the blood versus tissues . For instance , CD27 , an antigen expressed on Tcm cells , and CD69 , a marker of activation in blood but a T resident memory ( Trm ) marker in tissues ( Cantero-Pérez et al . , 2019 ) , were more highly expressed on FNA kNN latent cells ( Figure 4D , Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . PD1 and CXCR5 , markers of Tfh that are preferentially expressed in latent cells particularly in tissues ( Banga et al . , 2016 ) , were also expressed at especially high levels on kNN latent cells from FNAs ( Figure 4D , Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . The co-stimulatory molecule ICOS was expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells exclusively in FNAs , while the exhaustion marker TIGIT was more variably expressed ( Figure 4D , Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . These results reveal marked differences between the phenotypic features of kNN latent cells in blood versus lymph nodes , with the notable exception of PD1 , which was high in both compartments . We also characterized the reservoir in the gut , the primary site of viral persistence during suppressive therapy ( Estes et al . , 2017 ) . As longitudinal gut specimens were not available , we conducted a cross-sectional analysis comparing gut specimens from four donors to the blood specimens previously analyzed by PP-SLIDE . While differences in the reservoir between the blood and gut were observed , some interesting similarities also emerged . kNN latent cells from the gut were mostly CD69hiCD27lo , while those from blood exhibited a much more variable expression pattern of these two antigens ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . By contrast , kNN latent cells from both the gut and blood expressed high levels of PD1 but relatively low levels of CXCR5 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . Another similarity was that CTLA4 and CCR6 , previously reported to be preferentially expressed on latent cells from tissues ( Gosselin et al . , 2017; McGary et al . , 2017 ) , were both highly expressed in kNN latent cells from the gut and blood . Taken together with the FNA results , these analyses identify CD69 and PD1 as antigens expressed at high levels in kNN latent cells from both gut and lymph nodes , suggesting shared features of the reservoir between different tissue compartments . To compare the global similarities between kNN latent cells from the three compartments ( blood , lymph nodes , gut ) , we visualized the atlas and kNN latent cells of all donors combined using tSNE ( Figure 4E ) . Interestingly , the FNA atlas cells appeared equidistant to the blood and gut atlas cells , an observation confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations . By contrast , kNN latent cells from FNA and gut tended to cluster more closely together , away from those from blood , which we also confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations ( Figure 4E ) . Together with the above analyses suggesting that kNN latent cells from both tissue compartments express high levels of CD69 and PD1 , these results suggest that phenotypic features of the reservoir are shared between different tissue sites . That said , a notable difference was that kNN latent cells from FNAs included both naïve and memory cells , while those from the gut only included memory cells , potentially due to the under-representation of naïve cells within the gut compartment ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) . To determine whether surface markers differentially expressed on kNN latent cells can enrich for the replication-competent reservoir , we custom-designed sorting strategies for each of the four donor blood specimens . Because PD1 is arguably the most validated surface marker of latent cells ( Banga et al . , 2016; Chomont et al . , 2009; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) , we compared the additional enrichment afforded by our sorting strategy to that afforded by PD1 selection alone . Our panels took into account the expression levels of markers in kNN latent cells , the numbers of cryopreserved cells available from the participant , and the overall abundance of the populations in each sequential gate . The latter two aspects were important considerations as an infrequent population of cells may be highly enriched for kNN latent cells but too rare to sort in sufficient numbers for viral outgrowth and other downstream assays . We arrived at panels of 8–10 markers individualized for each participant . For each donor specimen , we isolated a PD1+ population that we submitted to further selection with the relevant marker panel ( enriched ) and two PD1+ populations that we did not subject to further selection ( disenriched ) . The disenriched populations harbored markedly lower frequencies of kNN latent cells than the enriched one ( Figure 5 ) . These populations were sorted ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) and subjected to multiple assays . We first conducted a viral outgrowth assay . Because sorting based on our 8–10 marker panels yielded few cells , we modified the qVOA accordingly . Sorted cells were stimulated in bulk for 2 days with anti-CD3/CD28 , and plated into individual wells at various dilutions . The HIV-permissive MOLT-CCR5 cell line was added to propagate viral replication , and after 2 weeks supernatants were quantitated for viral outgrowth by p24 ELISA . Replication was scored as the proportion of wells that had outgrowth and as the concentration of p24 in each well . Both scoring methods revealed strikingly more outgrowth in the enriched relative to both disenriched populations in all four donors ( Figure 6A ) . In fact , most disenriched populations did not result in any outgrowth even at the highest concentration tested ( 200 , 000 cells/well ) . The enriched populations also harbored more replication-competent HIV than total memory CD4+ T cells ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . Because recent studies suggest that the in vivo reservoir is transcriptionally active ( Yukl et al . , 2018 ) , we assessed HIV transcription initiation , elongation , and completion in the sorted populations . In the absence of stimulation , HIV transcriptional activity was observed in the sorted cells , with more transcription initiation in the enriched than disenriched ones in 7/8 instances ( Figure 6B ) . These results suggest that populations highly enriched for the replication-competent reservoir initiate HIV transcription in the absence of stimulation . We then assessed to what extent our 8–10 marker panels enrich for latent cells harboring intact genomes . We sequenced by FLIPS ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) proviruses from the enriched and from one of the disenriched populations , for each of three donors . Consistent with the PP-SLIDE and outgrowth results , enriched cells harbored higher frequencies of intact p24 sequences than disenriched ones ( Figure 6C ) . To assess the extent of clonal expansion , a major driver of HIV persistence ( Cohn et al . , 2020; Liu et al . , 2020 ) , we determined the proportions of expanded identical sequences ( EIS ) . EIS were prominent in both populations , but the proportions of EIS with intact p24 sequences were consistently higher in the enriched ones ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . A phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that in two of the donors ( PID1695 and PID5003 ) , EIS from the enriched and disenriched populations formed distinct lineages , while in donor PID3010 multiple EIS were shared between the enriched and disenriched populations ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ) . As the enriched population from PID5003 harbored a particularly high frequency of intact p24 sequences , we analyzed this donor in more detail . We categorized all the sequences analyzed from this individual into those that were full-length intact ( i . e . no defects along the entire proviral genome ) , and those harboring large internal deletions , hypermutations , premature stop codons , and inversions . Remarkably , 65 . 2% of the enriched population was fully intact , compared to only 0 . 9% for the disenriched population ( Figure 6D ) . This corresponded to an overall frequency of 214 full-length intact sequences per million in the enriched population , as compared to only two per million in the disenriched population . The vast majority ( 95 . 5% ) of the proviruses in the disenriched population harbored large internal deletions . EIS were prominent among both populations ( Figure 6E ) . Among the EIS in the enriched population , 66 . 7% were fully intact , compared to 0% in the disenriched population . Fully-intact EIS in the enriched population comprised two groups , suggesting two major expansions of replication-competent reservoir cells in this population of cells highly enriched for replication-competent HIV ( Figure 6E ) . Collectively , these results show that surface markers identified by PP-SLIDE can be used to enrich for replication-competent latent cells and that these cells are enriched for the transcriptionally active reservoir and exhibit clear evidence of clonal expansion of fully-intact proviruses . The sort panels implemented above were tailored for each donor specimen . Given that some features of kNN latent cells are shared between individuals ( Figure 3 ) , we set out to design a universal panel to enrich for latent cells in a donor-independent fashion . We designed a sorting strategy incorporating eight surface antigens that enrich for kNN latent cells from all four blood specimens analyzed ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 ) . As TIGIT was found to be expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells in some but not all donors ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 ) , we designed a strategy to isolate two enriched populations – one TIGIThigh and one TIGITmed/low – to test the hypothesis that TIGIT is indeed not a marker of latent cells shared between donors . These populations were compared to a PD1+ population disenriched for kNN latent cells ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 ) . We applied this ‘universal’ panel on four donor blood specimens ( Supplementary file 2 ) that had not undergone PP-SLIDE analysis ( Figure 6—figure supplement 6 ) . Viral outgrowth assays revealed robust outgrowth in the enriched but not disenriched populations ( Figure 6F ) . Furthermore , the TIGIThigh population harbored more viruses in some donors and the TIGITmed/low one in others , validating the notion that TIGIT is not a marker of latent cells shared between donors . These results suggest that shared features between kNN latent cells can be exploited to enrich for the replication-competent latent reservoir across donors .\nAlthough the latent reservoir has long been recognized as a major barrier to HIV cure , the phenotype of these latently infected cells in vivo has remained somewhat obscure . A common viewpoint , based on the limited number of studies that have conducted viral outgrowth assays on sorted cell populations , is that latent HIV persists in all types of CD4+ T cells with no preference for one subset over another . If so , targeting latently infected cells as a curative strategy would be all the more difficult . Taking advantage of recent developments in high-parameter single-cell phenotyping and our PP-SLIDE analysis pipeline , we now show that latently infected cells are not randomly distributed among CD4+ T cells , and provide an in-depth view of the phenotypic features of the in vivo blood and tissue reservoir . Multiple observations make us confident that PP-SLIDE identifies the physiologically relevant reservoir . First , our in vitro assay with J-Lat cells showed the method could predict the correct precursor cell 99 . 2% of the time . Second , cells sorted based on PP-SLIDE were enriched for genome-intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in the expected populations . Of note , our PP-SLIDE characterization had charted the translation-competent reservoir , defined as latent cells able to produce viral proteins upon stimulation ( Baxter et al . , 2018 ) , which may include some replication-incompetent HIV provirus ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Imamichi et al . , 2020 ) . Nevertheless , our viral outgrowth results closely aligned with the enrichment of kNN latent cells , confirming that PP-SLIDE identifies markers of the replication-competent HIV reservoir most relevant for a cure . Third , using our ‘universal panel , ’ we validated the preferential presence of the replication-competent reservoir in expected populations in four untested donors , and PP-SLIDE’s prediction that the latent reservoir is preferentially maintained in TIGIT-expressing cells in some but not all donors . The sorting strategies used in our validation experiments were designed to enable comparison of different populations of memory CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of PD1 , a marker preferentially expressed on reservoir cells ( Banga et al . , 2016; Chomont et al . , 2009; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) and which we found expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells . This was implemented for two reasons: First , to demonstrate that we can enrich for latent cells beyond the selection afforded by PD1 alone . Indeed both our viral outgrowth and proviral sequencing results confirmed PP-SLIDE’s prediction that some but not all PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cells harbor high frequencies of latent HIV . Second , to enable mechanistic comparisons of highly similar populations of sorted cells harboring vastly different levels of replication-competent HIV . We found that in 7/8 cases , the enriched populations initiated more HIV transcription than their disenriched counterparts , suggesting that the transcriptionally active reservoir associates most closely with the replication-competent reservoir and therefore should be a target of HIV curative strategies . We also found that relative to disenriched populations , the enriched ones harbored higher proportions of EIS with intact p24 , consistent with the importance of clonal expansion in driving the maintenance of the replication-competent HIV reservoir ( Bui et al . , 2017; Hosmane et al . , 2017; Lorenzi et al . , 2016 ) , although it should be noted that cells with different integration sites can harbor the same proviral sequence ( Patro et al . , 2019 ) . Of particular interest was our in-depth comparison of two PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cell populations from PID5003 . A striking 65 . 2% of proviruses in the enriched population from this donor were fully intact , versus 0 . 9% in the disenriched , despite both being PD1 expressors . To put these numbers in perspective , on average only 2–3% of sequences from infected individuals treated during chronic infection are intact ( Bruner et al . , 2016; Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . The overall frequency of intact provirus in the enriched PID5003 population was also extremely high: at 214 per million cells , it was more than an order of magnitude higher than what is observed in Tem ( range = 1–26 , median , 13 per million ) , the subset with the highest frequencies of intact provirus as assessed by FLIPS ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . This high frequency is not due to an unusually large overall reservoir in this donor , as the phenotypically-similar ( PD1+ ) disenriched population sequenced from this donor exhibited a frequency of only two per million . Our observation that this enriched population , but not the disenriched one , exhibited robust viral outgrowth , further suggests that the intact proviruses in this population are replication-competent . Interestingly , the intact sequences in this enriched population consisted of two large clusters of EIS , suggesting two major clonal expansions in this well-defined population of memory CD4+ cells sorted based on eight surface markers . As these two clusters of viral sequences likely integrated at different genomic sites , these observations support a host rather than virus-driven expansion of these latent cells . That we could find such vastly different levels of intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in our enriched versus disenriched populations goes against the notion that the reservoir is ‘everywhere’ and randomly distributed in all subsets . But how do our observations fit with prior reports that the frequencies of replication-competent provirus , as determined from outgrowth assays , were similar between sorted subsets ( Buzon et al . , 2014; Kwon et al . , 2020 ) ? We believe that the previously sorted subsets were not ones that differ markedly in reservoir frequencies . Most prior subset analyses had focused on the Tem and Tcm subsets , and when focusing on just these subsets our PP-SLIDE results indeed support the notion that both Tem and Tcm were prominent among kNN latent cells . However , our finding that the proportions of Tem were greater among the kNN latent cells than among atlas cells suggests that latency is somewhat biased toward the Tem subset , a finding in line with the higher prevalence of intact provirus in Tem over Tcm ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . Further supporting a non-random distribution of the reservoir is our identification of markers consistently expressed at higher levels on kNN latent cells relative to memory CD4+ T cells . Such markers include ones previously implicated in latency ( PD1 , CTLA4 , Ox40 ) ( Banga et al . , 2016; Fromentin et al . , 2016; Kuo et al . , 2018; McGary et al . , 2017 ) , some activation markers ( CD25 , CD69 ) , and markers of Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 cells ( Tbet , CRTh2 , and CCR6 , respectively ) suggesting preferential persistence of HIV in more differentiated cells . The reservoir may persist in these cells due to antigen- or homeostatically-driven expansion of these cells which can maintain the reservoir through repeated cycles of clonal expansion . Our analysis of longitudinal specimens by PP-SLIDE also provided insights into the stability of the reservoir and its capacity for reactivation . By comparing kNN latent cells from different donors versus longitudinal samples , we found intra-individual variability to be less than inter-individual variability . This observation implies that the phenotypic properties of the reservoir are stable over time , a feature that may facilitate its targeting . In fact , longitudinal stability also held for the reservoir’s susceptibility to the LRAs we tested . Our observation that different stimulatory signals reactivate different latent cells further suggests that ‘shock and kill’ strategies may require multiple LRAs , each preferentially targeting different cell subsets , as recently suggested ( Baxter et al . , 2016; Grau-Expósito et al . , 2019; Pardons et al . , 2019 ) . Although our study focused on the blood reservoir for logistical and technical reasons , we also conducted PP-SLIDE analyses on tissue specimens . Perhaps not surprising given the known phenotypic differences between T cells from blood versus tissues ( Wong et al . , 2015 ) , we found that blood and tissue kNN latent cells differ quite dramatically . High-dimensional distance calculations revealed that kNN latent cells were more similar between lymph node and gut than between the tissues and blood , suggesting phenotypic commonalities in the latent reservoir found in tissues . Indeed , kNN latent cells from both lymph node and gut expressed high levels of the Trm marker CD69 , suggesting that Trm in these tissues , like those from the cervix ( Cantero-Pérez et al . , 2019 ) , preferentially harbor the reservoir . Together with our observation that kNN latent cells from all sites examined expressed high levels of PD1 , these results suggest PD1-expressing Trm as possible targets to eliminate the tissue reservoir . Given recent findings that blood , lymph nodes , and gut are the major sources of HIV dissemination in ART-suppressed individuals ( Chaillon et al . , 2020 ) , targeting latent cells in the compartments analyzed in this study may be sufficient to make a meaningful reduction in the reservoir . Our study has some limitations , in particular , a relatively small sample size of only eight blood and five tissue donors , although some donors were characterized longitudinally . Nonetheless , our findings do not support the existence of a single surface biomarker that can be used to target the entire HIV reservoir at once . However , PP-SLIDE enables in-depth charting of the latent reservoir residing in the blood and , likely , any tissue we can access . For therapeutic applications , surface antigens identified by PP-SLIDE as preferentially co-expressed on latent cells can be targeted with a series of bi- or multi-specific antibodies ( Klein et al . , 2016 ) . More importantly , our ability to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent reservoir cells enables in-depth functional analyses of the reservoir and potentiates future implementation of discovery-based approaches such as scRNAseq and PCR-activated cell sorting ( PACS; Bradley et al . , 2018; Clark and Abate , 2017 ) . These approaches hold great promise for identifying novel markers for HIV eradication but require a high frequency of latent cells that was not achievable previously . We envision that implementing PP-SLIDE on cells phenotyped by scRNAseq together with Antibody-seq approaches ( Peterson et al . , 2017; Stoeckius et al . , 2017 ) will enable even higher-resolution mapping , with the added advantage that whole-transcriptome approaches do not require pre-defining markers of interest , and allow for the discovery of unanticipated—and perhaps unique—markers of latent cells .\nMultiple leukapheresis samples were obtained from eight HIV-1 subtype-B individuals on long-term ART who initiated therapy during chronic ( >1 year ) infection and were stably suppressed ( HIV RNA <40 copies/mL; Supplementary file 2 ) . Leukapheresis specimens from four of these eight individuals were subjected to full analyses using CyTOF/PP-SLIDE . Lymph node specimens were obtained from one of these four participants under local anesthesia using ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration . All fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) procedures were performed without any adverse effects , and the subject reported minimal to no discomfort both during and after the procedure and was able to perform their usual activities after the procedure . Gut specimens were obtained by sigmoid biopsies from four ART-suppressed HIV-infected participants ( Supplementary file 2 ) . All participants provided informed consent before participation . The study was approved by the University of California , San Francisco ( IRB # 10–01330 ) and the University of North Carolina ( IRB # 12–1660 ) . Memory CD4+ T cells from the blood of two HIV-seronegative donors were purified as described above , and then resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/mL in PBS containing 0 . 1% FBS . The cells were then loaded for 8 min with 1 . 5 μM of the proliferation dye CFSE ( ThermoFisher ) . Labeling was then stopped by the addition of an equal volume of pre-warmed , 100% FBS , and the labeled cells were incubated at 37°C for an additional 10 min . The sample was then washed three times in RP10 . Memory CD4+ T cells not exposed to CFSE were treated identically in parallel . The time = 0 specimen was immediately stained as described below . The remaining cells were cultured with or without activation with 16 nM PMA , 1 μM ionomycin , and 100 IU/mL IL2 ( all three reagents from Thermofisher ) . At the indicated time points , cells were stained with APC/Cyanine7 anti-human CD3 ( Clone SK7 , Biolegend ) , PE/Cy7 anti-human CD4 ( Clone A161A1 , Biolegend ) , Alexa Fluor 700 anti-human CD8 ( Clone SK1 , Biolegend ) , and Zombie Red ( Biolegend ) as a Live/Dead discriminator . Stained cells were fixed and analyzed by FACS on an LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) . Flowjo ( BD Biosciences ) was used for analysis . Live , singlet CD3+CD4+CD8- cells were assessed for proliferation by monitoring the loss of CFSE signal . Results shown are from one of two donors which gave similar results . 293 T cells were seeded in 6-well plates ( Falcon ) at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/well , and transfected the next day using FuGENE ( Promega ) with 0 . 5 μg/well of the F4 . GFP or F4 . HSA proviral constructs previously described ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020; Neidleman et al . , 2017 ) . Supernatants from the cultures were harvested after 2 days and p24Gag concentrations were measured with a Lenti-X p24 Rapid Titer kit ( Clontech ) . To demonstrate that the cocktail of ART used in this study was fully suppressive , PBMC-derived CD4+ T cells from HIV-seronegative donors were activated for 2 days with RP10 containing 10 μg PHA ( PeproTech ) and 100 IU/mL IL2 ( Thermofisher ) , washed with RP10 , and then cultured in 20 IU/mL IL2 for one additional day . The cells were then either left untreated , or pretreated for 1 hr with an ART cocktail consisting of 5 μM AZT , 5 μM Ritonavir , 8 nM Efavirenz , 10 μM Lamivudine , 50 nM Raltegravir , and 0 . 5 μg/mL T-20 ( all from NIH AIDS reagent program ) . Cells were then cultured for 4 days at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL with RP10 alone or in the presence of 250 ng/mL p24Gag F4 . GFP in RP10 containing 20 IU/mL IL2 . The cells were then stained for 30 min at 4°C at a concentration of 106 cells/well in FACS buffer , with anti-CD3 APC/Cyanine7 , anti-CD4 PE/Cy7 , anti-CD8 Alexa Fluor 700 , and Zombie Aqua as a Live/Dead discriminator ( all from Biolegend ) . The cells were then washed three times with FACS buffer and fixed overnight in 2% PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . The cells were analyzed on an LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) and Flowjo software was used to gate on live , singlet CD3+CD8- cells and infection rates in these cells were monitored by GFP expression . For atlas generation , we used freshly isolated and purified memory CD4+ T cells from blood , or freshly isolated total cells from tissues ( as described above ) . A portion of these cells was immediately treated with cisplatin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as a Live/Dead marker and fixed . Briefly , 6 × 106 cells were resuspended at room temperature in 2 mL PBS ( Rockland ) with 2 mM EDTA ( Corning ) . Next , 2 mL of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 25 μM cisplatin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were added to the cells . The cells were quickly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 60 s , after which 10 mL of CyFACS ( metal contaminant-free PBS [Rockland] supplemented with 0 . 1% FBS and 0 . 1% sodium azide [Sigma-Aldrich] ) was added to quench the reaction . The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 2% PFA in CyFACS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature . The cells were then washed twice in CyFACS , after which they were resuspended in 100 μL of CyFACS containing 10% DMSO . These fixed cells were stored at −80°C until analysis by CyTOF . The rest of the freshly isolated cells were stimulated to allow for latent cell reactivation . These cells were diluted to 2 × 106 cells/mL and stimulated with 16 nM PMA ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and 1 μM ionomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 40 hr . This stimulation time was chosen as it is similar to times previously implemented ( Cohn et al . , 2018 ) and shorter stimulations under these conditions did not lead to reactivation . Where indicated , cells were instead stimulated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD38 beads ( Gibco ) , or 12 nM PEP005 ( Ingenol 3-angelate , Sigma-Aldrich ) with 40 nM romidepsin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . For gut specimens , to minimize cellular toxicity , cells were instead stimulated for 16 hr with 160 nM PMA and 1 μM ionomycin . All stimulations were conducted in the presence of 100 IU/mL IL2 ( Thermofisher ) . To prevent spreading infection , a cocktail of ART consisting of 5 μM AZT , 5 μM Ritonavir , 8 nM Efavirenz , 10 μM Lamivudine , 50 nM Raltegravir , and 0 . 5 μg/mL T-20 was added . To limit the death of reactivated cells , 10 μM of the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK ( R and D Systems Inc ) was added as previously described ( Cohn et al . , 2018; Grau-Expósito et al . , 2019 ) . Staining of cells for analysis by CyTOF was conducted similar to recently described methods ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020; Trapecar et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , cisplatin-treated cells were thawed and washed in Nunc 96 DeepWell polystyrene plates ( Thermo Fisher ) with CyFACS buffer at a concentration of 6 × 106 cells/800 μL per well . Cells were then pelleted and blocked with mouse ( Thermo Fisher ) , rat ( Thermo Fisher ) , and human AB ( Sigma-Aldrich ) sera for 15 min at 4°C . The samples were then washed twice in CyFACS , pelleted , and stained in a 100 μL cocktail of surface antibodies ( Supplementary file 1 ) for 45 min at 4°C . The samples were then washed 3× with CyFACS and fixed overnight at 4°C in 100 μL of freshly prepared 2% PFA in PBS ( Rockland ) . Samples were then washed twice with Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) and incubated in this buffer for 45 min at 4°C . Next , samples were washed twice in Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) . The samples were then blocked for 15 min at 4°C in 100 μL of mouse and rat sera diluted in Permeabilization Buffer , washed 1× with Permeabilization buffer , and incubated for 45 min at 4°C in a 100 μL cocktail of intracellular antibodies ( Supplementary file 1 ) diluted in Permeabilization Buffer . The cells were then washed with CyFACS and stained for 20 min at room temperature with 250 nM of Cell-ID Intercalator-IR ( Fluidigm ) . Finally , the cells were washed 2× with CyFACS buffer , once with MaxPar cell staining buffer ( Fluidigm ) , and once with Cell acquisition solution ( CAS , Fluidigm ) , and then resuspended in EQ Four Element Calibration Beads ( Fluidigm ) diluted to 1× in CAS . The sample concentration was adjusted to acquire at a rate of 200–350 events/sec using a wide-bore ( WB ) injector on a CyTOF2 instrument ( Fluidigm ) at the UCSF Parnassus flow core facility . For tissue specimens where multiple specimens were combined to minimize cell loss , the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit ( Fluidigm ) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to barcode the individual cisplatin-treated samples before mixing . Briefly , the frozen and fixed samples were thawed and washed once with CyFACS and 2× with Maxpar Barcode Perm Buffer ( Fluidigm ) , and then resuspended in 800 μL of Barcode Perm Buffer . A total of 10 μL of each barcode was diluted in 100 μL of Barcode Permeabilization Buffer and added to each sample . The samples were barcoded for 30 min at room temperature , washed once with MaxPar cell staining buffer , and once with CyFACS . The samples were then combined subjected to the CyTOF staining protocol as described above . Memory CD4+ T cells purified from cryopreserved PBMCs as described above were sorted using the following antibodies . Antibody clone numbers are indicated in the table further below: Dead cells were excluded using the Zombie Aqua fixable viability kit ( BioLegend ) , while doublets were excluded based on FSC-A/FSC-H . Cells were sorted on an Aria FACS sorter ( Becton Dickinson ) . The purity of the subsets was confirmed by analysis on the Aria immediately post-sort .

Of note , all populations of cells were sorted before stimulation to account for any effects of the sorting process on viral outgrowth . After 48 hr of culture , cells were diluted to a concentration of 105 cells/mL in RPMI supplemented with 60 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 , and then plated at 2 × 105 cells per well ( dilution A ) , 4 × 104 cells per well ( dilution B ) , 8 × 103 cells per well ( dilution C ) , and 1 . 6 × 103 cells per well ( dilution D ) . Molt4/CCR5 cells ( Laird et al . , 2013 ) were then added at 105 cells per well . Cultures were replenished at days 3 , 6 , 12 , and 15 by replacing half of the media with RPMI containing 5 IU/mL IL-2 without disturbing the cellular layer . On day 9 , half the cultures , inclusive of both cells and media , were discarded , and the remaining cells were replenished with the same volume of RPMI containing 105 Molt4/CCR5 cells . At the end of the culture period ( days 15–18 ) , supernatants were quantitated for levels of p24 antigen by ELISA ( Takara ) . A viral outgrowth assay was conducted for one of the gut specimens ( PID1223 ) to demonstrate the presence of replication-competent virus in the tissue . To this end , a Digital ELISA Viral Outgrowth ( DEVO ) assay was implemented . Pooled biopsy cells were plated in a limiting dilution format at five replicates at 470 , 000 cells per well , 12 replicates at 100 , 000 cells per well , and 12 replicates at 25 , 000 cells per well . Cells were stimulated for 24 hr with 3 µg/mL phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ) ( Thermofisher ) , 100 IU/mL IL-2 , and irradiated PBMCs from an HIV-seronegative donor . The cells were washed and Molt4/CCR5 target cells were added to amplify outgrowth of HIV . The cultures were replenished with fresh media every 3–4 days , and another round of Molt4/CCR5 cells added on day 9 post-stimulation . Supernatants were harvested on days 9 , 13 , 16 , 20 , 26 , and 29 post-stimulation and assessed for HIV p24 using the SIMOA HD-1 Analyzer ( Quanterix , Billerica , MA ) . Only wells exhibiting sustained and increasing p24 expression over time were scored as positive . The frequency of infection reported as Infectious Units Per Million ( IUPM ) of rectal-sigmoid cells was calculated using the SLDAssay R software package ( Trumble et al . , 2017 ) . The IUPM from this analysis was 0 . 265 , with 95% confidence intervals between 0 . 0216 and 1 . 400 . Of note , this IUPM corresponds to that of total gut cells . Pellets of sorted cells were lysed in 1 mL TRI reagent with 2 . 5 μL polyacryl carrier ( Molecular Research Center ) . Total cellular RNA was subsequently extracted per the TRI Reagent protocol , while total cellular DNA was extracted using the ‘back extraction buffer’ ( 4M guanidine thiocyanate , 50 mM sodium citrate , 1M Tris ) as described ( Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . A common reverse transcriptase ( RT ) reaction was used to generate cDNA for all droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) assays except TAR , where a separate two-step RT was performed as described ( Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , each 50 µL RT reaction contained cellular RNA , 5 µL of 10× Superscript III buffer ( Invitrogen ) , 5 µL of 50 mM MgCl2 , 2 . 5 µL of 50 ng / µL random hexamers ( Invitrogen ) , 2 . 5 µL of 50 µM dT15 , 2 . 5 µL of 10 mM dNTPs , 1 . 25 µL of 40 U / µL RNaseOUT ( Invitrogen ) , and 2 . 5 µL of 200 U / µL Superscript III RT ( Invitrogen ) . PBMCs from uninfected donors , and water that was subjected to nucleic extraction by TRI Reagent , served as negative controls for each transcript . The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 25°C for 10 min , 50°C for 50 min , and an inactivation step at 85°C for 5 min . For the ddPCR reactions , cDNA from each sample was assayed in duplicate wells for TAR , Long LTR , Pol , and PolyA regions using validated assays ( Kaiser et al . , 2017; Telwatte et al . , 2018; Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . Total cell equivalents in the DNA extracted from the same samples were determined by measuring the absolute copy numbers of a nonduplicated cellular gene , Telomere Reverse Transcriptase ( TERT ) , similar to previously described methods ( Telwatte et al . , 2018; Yukl et al . , 2018 ) . To account for the effects of deletions or hypermutations on the HIV RNA measurements , all HIV RNAs were further normalized to HIV DNA measured by the same assay used for the RNA . Each 20 µL ddPCR reaction contained 5 µL cDNA or DNA , 10 µL of ddPCR Supermix for Probes ( no dUTP ) ( Bio-Rad , Hercules ) , 900 nM of primers , and 250 nM of probe . Following production of droplet emulsions using the QX100 Droplet Generator ( Bio-Rad ) , samples were amplified under the following thermocycling conditions using a 7900 Thermal Cycler ( Life Technologies ) : 10 min at 95°C , 45 cycles of 30 s at 95°C and 59°C for 60 s , and a final droplet cure step of 10 min at 98°C . Droplets were quantified using the QX100 Droplet Reader ( Bio-Rad ) and analyzed using the QuantaSoft software ( version 1 . 6 . 6 , Bio-Rad ) in the ‘Rare Event Detection’ quantification mode . The FLIPS assay was performed as previously reported ( Hiener et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , HIV-1 proviruses within sorted CD4+ T cell subsets were amplified and sequenced at limiting dilution to near full-length ( 9 kb; 92% of the genome ) . A median of 140 individual proviruses ( range 18–254 ) was sequenced per sorted population of cells from three of the four participant blood specimens analyzed by PP-SLIDE . The next-generation sequencing was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq platform with individual proviruses de novo assembled using a specifically designed workflow in CLC Genomics . Proviruses were characterized as defective if they contained INDELs , stop codons , or APOBEC3G hypermutations , or intact ( full-length ) if they lacked such defects . Expanded identical sequences ( EIS ) were identified using ElimDupes from the Los Alamos database ( https://www . hiv . lanl . gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes . html ) . All sequences that were 100% identical were considered part of an EIS cluster . Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees using the generalized time-reversible model were estimated for each participant using Geneius . Branch support was inferred using 1000 bootstrap replicates . Annotated tree images were constructed using the iTOL software Version 5 . 5 . 1 ( Letunic and Bork , 2019 ) . The CyTOF data were exported as FCS files , and samples were de-barcoded according to manufacturer’s instructions ( Fluidigm ) . For the J-Lat experiments , equal numbers of the unstimulated live , singlet intact 6 . 3 and 5A8 were concatenated together as a source of the ‘atlas cells’ . Reactivated 6 . 3 cells were identified by gating on the Gag-expressing cells in the stimulated 6 . 3 sample . For patient samples , events corresponding to live , singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells from unstimulated samples were exported as a source of the atlas cells . Events corresponding to reactivated cells were identified by gating upon live , singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells expressing Gag on all three Gag channels , and exported as the population of reactivated cells . Where indicated , naïve cells ( CD45RA+CD45RO- ) were gated out before export . Data export was conducted using FlowJo ( BD Biosciences ) and Cytobank software . tSNE analyses were performed using the Cytobank software with default settings . All cellular markers not used in the upstream gating strategy were included in generating the tSNE plots . Non-cellular markers ( e . g . live/dead stain ) and the HIV gag proteins were excluded for the generation of tSNE plots . Dot plots were generated using both Cytobank and FlowJo . PP-SLIDE analysis to identify kNN latent cells followed our previously described method ( Cavrois et al . , 2017; Ma et al . , 2020 ) . Using a custom script in R ( source code made available as part of manuscript ) , each reactivated ( Gag+ ) cell from the stimulated sample was mapped against every cell in the unstimulated atlas generated immediately after sample procurement , to identify the kNN latent cells for each patient sample . The steps implemented for PP-SLIDE are summarized below: To assess the intra-individual and inter-individual variability in kNN latent cells and to compare kNN latent cells reactivated following treatment with PMA/ionomycin , anti-CD3/CD28 , and Romidepsin/PEP005 , empirical cumulative distributions were calculated . The distributions of median distances in 32-dimensional space ( corresponding to measured protein levels of antigens not used in the upstream gating strategy ) corresponded to those between cells of the indicated pairs of samples . The median ( Euclidean ) distance over all cells in the first sample was computed for each cell in the second sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors . Then , similarly , the median ( Euclidean ) distance over all cells in the second sample was computed for each cell in the first sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors . The union of these two sets of median distances was used to determine the distribution of median distances between the sample pair . These resulting datasets were visualized in terms of a cumulative distribution function using the stat_ecdf function of the ggplot2 package in R . This section describes in detail how FlowSOM was implemented to cluster the atlas and kNN latent cells , and how this information was used to demonstrate non-random distribution of kNN latent cells among memory CD4+ T cells . For simplicity , we have illustrated the process with one of the four leukapheresis donors ( PID1695 ) , but similar methods were implemented for the other three . The FlowSOM analysis for all four donor specimens revealed a non-random distribution of kNN latent cells among memory CD4+ T cells .

         "There is no cure for the human immunodeficiency virus infection ( HIV ) , but anti-retroviral drugs allow infected people to keep the virus at bay and lead a normal life . These drugs suppress the growth of HIV , but they do not eliminate the virus . If the treatment is interrupted , the virus bounces back within weeks in most individuals . HIV can start growing again because it hides within particular immune cells , called T cells . These infected cells stay in the infected person’s body for their whole life in a dormant or “latent” state , and represent the main barrier to an HIV cure . If these cells could be eliminated or prevented from producing more virus without daily treatment , then HIV could be cured . The fact that HIV hides inside T cells has been known for a long time , but it has remained unclear exactly what kinds of T cells the virus prefers . One challenge to characterizing latently-infected cells is that there is no single protein made by them that is not also made by uninfected T cells . The latently-infected T cells are also very rare: HIV mainly attaches to a protein called CD4 , but only one in about a million T cells with CD4 contain the virus . To figure out which CD4-carrying T cells in a patient sample are latently infected , the cells are extracted from the patient’s body and ‘reactivated’ so the virus will start growing again . Unfortunately , the mixture of drugs used to reactivate the T cells changes the cells and the proteins they are producing , which obscures the features the latently-infected T cells had before reactivation . Neidleman , Luo et al . developed a new approach to trace the infected , reactivated T cells back to their state before reactivation . Using computational methods and a laboratory technique called mass cytometry , the levels of approximately 40 different proteins were measured in millions of T cells from people living with HIV . These experiments provided an ‘atlas’ of overall T cell features onto which each reactivated cell could be mapped . The population of latently-infected T cells exhibited common features among all the participants . Selecting a few of the most abundant proteins on the surface of the latently-infected cells allowed these cells to be physically separated from all other immune cells . In the future , this relatively pure population of infected T cells could be used to study how HIV can persist for many decades . The ‘map’ of these cells’ features will provide a valuable resource for HIV researchers and might enable the discovery of new drugs to eliminate the latent T cells .",

         "As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly , the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive . Here , we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states . By selecting 8–10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers , we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells . Our understanding of the phenotypic features of latent cells in vivo is limited , in large part because the lack of a universal surface biomarker makes it impossible to directly identify these cells . In the absence of direct ways to phenotype latent cells , characterizing the composition of the HIV reservoir has largely entailed sorting CD4+ T cells based on predefined sets of cell-surface proteins , followed by quantitating HIV through a variety of methods . A vast majority of infected cells in virally suppressed individuals harbor defective HIV genomes  . Older quantitation methods based on measuring total HIV DNA/RNA levels , regardless of provirus integrity , are being replaced with methods quantitating levels of replication-competent or genome-intact provirus . Such observations have led many researchers to consider the replication-competent reservoir as equally residing in all cell subsets , which if true makes targeting it more difficult . Although analyses of sorted populations have provided meaningful insights into HIV persistence , they have been limited to comparing cell populations that differ in one or two markers . Thus , they do not provide a comprehensive view of the phenotypic features of latent cells . These methods entail stimulating cells from ART-suppressed patients with a mitogen to induce the expression of HIV RNA and/or proteins , which serve as markers for identifying or isolating cells using FACS . However , one important limitation with these methods is that they require ex vivo stimulation before phenotyping as viral proteins are not typically expressed at detectable levels in unstimulated latent cells  . This stimulation will induce phenotypic changes associated with T cell activation , and expression of HIV accessory genes from reactivation will result in host cell remodeling  , which will further alter the phenotypes of the cells  . Therefore , although current methods enable phenotyping of reactivated cells , there is at present no methodology to directly assess the phenotypes of individual latent cells in their original dormant state . Here , we applied it to determine the features of in vivo latent CD4+ T cells before their reactivation by ex vivo stimulation , and validated these findings with patient specimens . Through PP-SLIDE analysis , we were able to address questions fundamental to our understanding of HIV latency and to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent latent cells for mechanistic studies of reservoir maintenance . PP-SLIDE was recently validated as an approach to trace HIV-remodeled cells to their original pre-infection states  . To determine if it can trace reactivated cells to their original latent state , we tested it first in J-Lat cells , an in vitro model of HIV latency . 3 were reactivated by stimulation with PMA/ionomycin and phenotyped using a CyTOF T cell panel  , along with unstimulated cells of clone 6 . 3 cell . These unstimulated cells , identified using a k-nearest neighbor  approach , are collectively termed ‘kNN latent cells’ . These results suggest that although reactivation greatly changes the phenotype of a latent cell , some of the original ‘identity’ of the cell is still retained and that PP-SLIDE can be used to capture this information and thereby identify precursors of reactivated latent cells . Next , we applied PP-SLIDE to characterize latent cells from HIV-infected individuals , using a CyTOF panel  that is directed at markers of the major subsets and differentiation states of CD4+ T cells and includes receptors and intracellular proteins associated with latency  . The CyTOF profiles of reactivated cells were matched against those of the unstimulated atlas cells . Assuming each reactivated cell retained some of its original pre-stimulation identity and that a phenotypically similar cell was present in the atlas of unstimulated cells , we used PP-SLIDE to identify , for each reactivated cell , the nearest-neighbor within the atlas  . These identified cells , the ‘kNN latent cells’ , harbor the predicted phenotypes of latent cells before their reactivation from latency . We identified between 20 and 96 reactivated cells per specimen , corresponding to a mean frequency of 11 . When visualized against the atlas of unstimulated cells by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding  , Gag+ reactivated cells occupied a unique region , confirming their distinct phenotype relative to unstimulated cells  . kNN latent cells mapped to several distinct regions of the atlas  , suggesting a non-random distribution among memory CD4+ T cells . To verify this , we implemented FlowSOM  to subdivide the atlases from each of the four donors into 20 clusters , and visualized the distribution of kNN latent cells on the tSNE maps or on pie graphs  . We found large clusters lacking kNN latent cells as well as small clusters harboring kNN latent cells , consistent with a non-random distribution of latent cells , which was confirmed using a chi-squared test  . We focused first on the Tcm , Tem , and Ttm subsets , as they have been the most commonly studied memory CD4+ T cells in the context of HIV latency  . In all four donors , the contribution of Tem to the reservoir was greater than its contribution to total memory CD4+ T cells  . We did not identify any kNN latent cells with the Ttm phenotype , likely because this subset is relatively rare in blood and not efficiently captured in our samples , each of which harbored fewer than 100 kNN latent cells . When the three FlowSOM clusters of atlas cells with the highest frequencies of kNN latent cells were examined for the relative contributions of the Tcm , Tem , and Ttm subsets , we found that they were all comprised of multiple subsets  . Collectively , these data demonstrate that although Tem are over-represented among kNN latent cells , the clusters most enriched for kNN latent cells – as classified by unbiased clustering based on ~40 markers – are a mixture of Tcm/Tem/Ttm subsets . Alternatively , they could mean that latency markers shared between individuals are not those used to define Tcm/Tem/Ttm cells . Consistent with this conclusion , relative to total memory CD4+ T cells , kNN latent cells consistently expressed higher levels of select markers of immune checkpoint  , activation  , and T cell differentiation states  . To test this idea , we obtained leukapheresis specimens from donor PID5003 at two time points spaced 2 months apart and compared in an unbiased manner the kNN latent cells from those specimens to kNN latent cells from donor PID3010  . For each kNN latent cell in the PID3010 sample , we calculated the Euclidean distances  to every kNN latent cell in the PID5003 sample . Next , we took advantage of our ability to obtain high-resolution maps of the phenotypic features of latent cells to compare their reactivation by different ex vivo stimulations . Euclidean distance calculations  revealed that PMA/ionomycin-reactivatable kNN latent cells from different collection time points were more similar to each other than to anti-CD3/CD28-reactivatable kNN latent cells from the same time point  . tSNE visualization of the kNN latent cells revealed a region of the plot that harbored kNN latent cells from the PMA/ionomycin samples but not from the Romidepsin/PEP005 samples  . Euclidean distance calculations  were again used to verify that kNN latent cells reactivatable by the same stimulation at different time points were more similar than those reactivatable by different stimulations within the same time point  . These data suggest that Romdepsin/PEP005 reactivates only a subset of latent cells reactivatable by broad-spectrum mitogens such as PMA/ionomycin , although these findings should be confirmed with longitudinal specimens from additional donors . Unlike with blood specimens , memory CD4+ T cells were not purified ahead of time since FNAs yielded limited numbers of cells . However , we pre-gated on memory CD4+ T cells to compare with purified blood cells . The kNN latent cells from the FNAs , similar to those from blood , were not randomly distributed and remained similar across the longitudinal specimens as demonstrated by their occupying similar regions of tSNE space  . For instance , CD27 , an antigen expressed on Tcm cells , and CD69 , a marker of activation in blood but a T resident memory  marker in tissues  , were more highly expressed on FNA kNN latent cells  . PD1 and CXCR5 , markers of Tfh that are preferentially expressed in latent cells particularly in tissues  , were also expressed at especially high levels on kNN latent cells from FNAs  . kNN latent cells from the gut were mostly CD69hiCD27lo , while those from blood exhibited a much more variable expression pattern of these two antigens  . Taken together with the FNA results , these analyses identify CD69 and PD1 as antigens expressed at high levels in kNN latent cells from both gut and lymph nodes , suggesting shared features of the reservoir between different tissue compartments . By contrast , kNN latent cells from FNA and gut tended to cluster more closely together , away from those from blood , which we also confirmed by Euclidean distance calculations  . Together with the above analyses suggesting that kNN latent cells from both tissue compartments express high levels of CD69 and PD1 , these results suggest that phenotypic features of the reservoir are shared between different tissue sites . To determine whether surface markers differentially expressed on kNN latent cells can enrich for the replication-competent reservoir , we custom-designed sorting strategies for each of the four donor blood specimens . The latter two aspects were important considerations as an infrequent population of cells may be highly enriched for kNN latent cells but too rare to sort in sufficient numbers for viral outgrowth and other downstream assays . The disenriched populations harbored markedly lower frequencies of kNN latent cells than the enriched one  . Because sorting based on our 8–10 marker panels yielded few cells , we modified the qVOA accordingly . The HIV-permissive MOLT-CCR5 cell line was added to propagate viral replication , and after 2 weeks supernatants were quantitated for viral outgrowth by p24 ELISA . Replication was scored as the proportion of wells that had outgrowth and as the concentration of p24 in each well . A phylogenetic analysis of the sequences revealed that in two of the donors  , EIS from the enriched and disenriched populations formed distinct lineages , while in donor PID3010 multiple EIS were shared between the enriched and disenriched populations  . As the enriched population from PID5003 harbored a particularly high frequency of intact p24 sequences , we analyzed this donor in more detail . Fully-intact EIS in the enriched population comprised two groups , suggesting two major expansions of replication-competent reservoir cells in this population of cells highly enriched for replication-competent HIV  . Collectively , these results show that surface markers identified by PP-SLIDE can be used to enrich for replication-competent latent cells and that these cells are enriched for the transcriptionally active reservoir and exhibit clear evidence of clonal expansion of fully-intact proviruses . Given that some features of kNN latent cells are shared between individuals  , we set out to design a universal panel to enrich for latent cells in a donor-independent fashion . As TIGIT was found to be expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells in some but not all donors  , we designed a strategy to isolate two enriched populations – one TIGIThigh and one TIGITmed/low – to test the hypothesis that TIGIT is indeed not a marker of latent cells shared between donors . These results suggest that shared features between kNN latent cells can be exploited to enrich for the replication-competent latent reservoir across donors . A common viewpoint , based on the limited number of studies that have conducted viral outgrowth assays on sorted cell populations , is that latent HIV persists in all types of CD4+ T cells with no preference for one subset over another . If so , targeting latently infected cells as a curative strategy would be all the more difficult . Taking advantage of recent developments in high-parameter single-cell phenotyping and our PP-SLIDE analysis pipeline , we now show that latently infected cells are not randomly distributed among CD4+ T cells , and provide an in-depth view of the phenotypic features of the in vivo blood and tissue reservoir . First , our in vitro assay with J-Lat cells showed the method could predict the correct precursor cell 99 . Second , cells sorted based on PP-SLIDE were enriched for genome-intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in the expected populations . Of note , our PP-SLIDE characterization had charted the translation-competent reservoir , defined as latent cells able to produce viral proteins upon stimulation  , which may include some replication-incompetent HIV provirus  . Third , using our ‘universal panel , ’ we validated the preferential presence of the replication-competent reservoir in expected populations in four untested donors , and PP-SLIDE’s prediction that the latent reservoir is preferentially maintained in TIGIT-expressing cells in some but not all donors . The sorting strategies used in our validation experiments were designed to enable comparison of different populations of memory CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of PD1 , a marker preferentially expressed on reservoir cells  and which we found expressed at high levels on kNN latent cells . Indeed both our viral outgrowth and proviral sequencing results confirmed PP-SLIDE’s prediction that some but not all PD1-expressing memory CD4+ T cells harbor high frequencies of latent HIV . Second , to enable mechanistic comparisons of highly similar populations of sorted cells harboring vastly different levels of replication-competent HIV . The overall frequency of intact provirus in the enriched PID5003 population was also extremely high: at 214 per million cells , it was more than an order of magnitude higher than what is observed in Tem  , the subset with the highest frequencies of intact provirus as assessed by FLIPS  . This high frequency is not due to an unusually large overall reservoir in this donor , as the phenotypically-similar  disenriched population sequenced from this donor exhibited a frequency of only two per million . Interestingly , the intact sequences in this enriched population consisted of two large clusters of EIS , suggesting two major clonal expansions in this well-defined population of memory CD4+ cells sorted based on eight surface markers . That we could find such vastly different levels of intact and replication-competent reservoir cells in our enriched versus disenriched populations goes against the notion that the reservoir is ‘everywhere’ and randomly distributed in all subsets . However , our finding that the proportions of Tem were greater among the kNN latent cells than among atlas cells suggests that latency is somewhat biased toward the Tem subset , a finding in line with the higher prevalence of intact provirus in Tem over Tcm  . Further supporting a non-random distribution of the reservoir is our identification of markers consistently expressed at higher levels on kNN latent cells relative to memory CD4+ T cells . Such markers include ones previously implicated in latency   , some activation markers  , and markers of Th1 , Th2 , and Th17 cells  suggesting preferential persistence of HIV in more differentiated cells . The reservoir may persist in these cells due to antigen- or homeostatically-driven expansion of these cells which can maintain the reservoir through repeated cycles of clonal expansion . By comparing kNN latent cells from different donors versus longitudinal samples , we found intra-individual variability to be less than inter-individual variability . This observation implies that the phenotypic properties of the reservoir are stable over time , a feature that may facilitate its targeting . Our observation that different stimulatory signals reactivate different latent cells further suggests that ‘shock and kill’ strategies may require multiple LRAs , each preferentially targeting different cell subsets , as recently suggested  . Perhaps not surprising given the known phenotypic differences between T cells from blood versus tissues  , we found that blood and tissue kNN latent cells differ quite dramatically . High-dimensional distance calculations revealed that kNN latent cells were more similar between lymph node and gut than between the tissues and blood , suggesting phenotypic commonalities in the latent reservoir found in tissues . Indeed , kNN latent cells from both lymph node and gut expressed high levels of the Trm marker CD69 , suggesting that Trm in these tissues , like those from the cervix  , preferentially harbor the reservoir . Given recent findings that blood , lymph nodes , and gut are the major sources of HIV dissemination in ART-suppressed individuals  , targeting latent cells in the compartments analyzed in this study may be sufficient to make a meaningful reduction in the reservoir . More importantly , our ability to isolate highly enriched populations of replication-competent reservoir cells enables in-depth functional analyses of the reservoir and potentiates future implementation of discovery-based approaches such as scRNAseq and PCR-activated cell sorting  . These approaches hold great promise for identifying novel markers for HIV eradication but require a high frequency of latent cells that was not achievable previously . We envision that implementing PP-SLIDE on cells phenotyped by scRNAseq together with Antibody-seq approaches  will enable even higher-resolution mapping , with the added advantage that whole-transcriptome approaches do not require pre-defining markers of interest , and allow for the discovery of unanticipated—and perhaps unique—markers of latent cells . Leukapheresis specimens from four of these eight individuals were subjected to full analyses using CyTOF/PP-SLIDE . All fine needle aspirate  procedures were performed without any adverse effects , and the subject reported minimal to no discomfort both during and after the procedure and was able to perform their usual activities after the procedure . Memory CD4+ T cells from the blood of two HIV-seronegative donors were purified as described above , and then resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/mL in PBS containing 0 . The cells were then loaded for 8 min with 1 . Labeling was then stopped by the addition of an equal volume of pre-warmed , 100% FBS , and the labeled cells were incubated at 37°C for an additional 10 min . At the indicated time points , cells were stained with APC/Cyanine7 anti-human CD3  , PE/Cy7 anti-human CD4  , Alexa Fluor 700 anti-human CD8  , and Zombie Red  as a Live/Dead discriminator . Live , singlet CD3+CD4+CD8- cells were assessed for proliferation by monitoring the loss of CFSE signal . 293 T cells were seeded in 6-well plates  at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/well , and transfected the next day using FuGENE  with 0 . To demonstrate that the cocktail of ART used in this study was fully suppressive , PBMC-derived CD4+ T cells from HIV-seronegative donors were activated for 2 days with RP10 containing 10 μg PHA  and 100 IU/mL IL2  , washed with RP10 , and then cultured in 20 IU/mL IL2 for one additional day . Cells were then cultured for 4 days at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/mL with RP10 alone or in the presence of 250 ng/mL p24Gag F4 . The cells were then stained for 30 min at 4°C at a concentration of 106 cells/well in FACS buffer , with anti-CD3 APC/Cyanine7 , anti-CD4 PE/Cy7 , anti-CD8 Alexa Fluor 700 , and Zombie Aqua as a Live/Dead discriminator  . The cells were analyzed on an LSRII  and Flowjo software was used to gate on live , singlet CD3+CD8- cells and infection rates in these cells were monitored by GFP expression . For atlas generation , we used freshly isolated and purified memory CD4+ T cells from blood , or freshly isolated total cells from tissues  . Next , 2 mL of PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 25 μM cisplatin  were added to the cells . The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 2% PFA in CyFACS and incubated for 10 min at room temperature . The cells were then washed twice in CyFACS , after which they were resuspended in 100 μL of CyFACS containing 10% DMSO . Where indicated , cells were instead stimulated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD38 beads  , or 12 nM PEP005  with 40 nM romidepsin  . Staining of cells for analysis by CyTOF was conducted similar to recently described methods  . Cells were then pelleted and blocked with mouse  , rat  , and human AB  sera for 15 min at 4°C . The samples were then blocked for 15 min at 4°C in 100 μL of mouse and rat sera diluted in Permeabilization Buffer , washed 1× with Permeabilization buffer , and incubated for 45 min at 4°C in a 100 μL cocktail of intracellular antibodies  diluted in Permeabilization Buffer . The cells were then washed with CyFACS and stained for 20 min at room temperature with 250 nM of Cell-ID Intercalator-IR  . Finally , the cells were washed 2× with CyFACS buffer , once with MaxPar cell staining buffer  , and once with Cell acquisition solution  , and then resuspended in EQ Four Element Calibration Beads  diluted to 1× in CAS . For tissue specimens where multiple specimens were combined to minimize cell loss , the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit  was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to barcode the individual cisplatin-treated samples before mixing . The samples were barcoded for 30 min at room temperature , washed once with MaxPar cell staining buffer , and once with CyFACS . Memory CD4+ T cells purified from cryopreserved PBMCs as described above were sorted using the following antibodies . 1BD  BUV737 Mouse Anti-Human CD28CD28 . 2BioLegend  APC-Cy7 Mouse Anti-Human CD69FN50BD  BV421 Mouse Anti-Human CD2TS1/8BioLegend  PE-Cy7 Mouse Anti-Human CD57TBO1Invitrogen  Cells sorted from blood were cultured at a density of 106 cells/mL in RPMI in the presence of 60 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2  , and activated with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28  at a ratio of 1 bead/cell . After 48 hr of culture , cells were diluted to a concentration of 105 cells/mL in RPMI supplemented with 60 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 , and then plated at 2 × 105 cells per well  , 4 × 104 cells per well  , 8 × 103 cells per well  , and 1 . 6 × 103 cells per well  . Molt4/CCR5 cells  were then added at 105 cells per well . Cells were stimulated for 24 hr with 3 µg/mL phytohemagglutinin   , 100 IU/mL IL-2 , and irradiated PBMCs from an HIV-seronegative donor . The cells were washed and Molt4/CCR5 target cells were added to amplify outgrowth of HIV . Only wells exhibiting sustained and increasing p24 expression over time were scored as positive . The frequency of infection reported as Infectious Units Per Million  of rectal-sigmoid cells was calculated using the SLDAssay R software package  . Of note , this IUPM corresponds to that of total gut cells . Pellets of sorted cells were lysed in 1 mL TRI reagent with 2 . A common reverse transcriptase  reaction was used to generate cDNA for all droplet digital PCR  assays except TAR , where a separate two-step RT was performed as described  . Total cell equivalents in the DNA extracted from the same samples were determined by measuring the absolute copy numbers of a nonduplicated cellular gene , Telomere Reverse Transcriptase  , similar to previously described methods  . To account for the effects of deletions or hypermutations on the HIV RNA measurements , all HIV RNAs were further normalized to HIV DNA measured by the same assay used for the RNA . A median of 140 individual proviruses  was sequenced per sorted population of cells from three of the four participant blood specimens analyzed by PP-SLIDE . The next-generation sequencing was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq platform with individual proviruses de novo assembled using a specifically designed workflow in CLC Genomics . Expanded identical sequences  were identified using ElimDupes from the Los Alamos database  . Annotated tree images were constructed using the iTOL software Version 5 . The CyTOF data were exported as FCS files , and samples were de-barcoded according to manufacturer’s instructions  . Events corresponding to reactivated cells were identified by gating upon live , singlet intact CD3+CD19-CD8- T cells expressing Gag on all three Gag channels , and exported as the population of reactivated cells . PP-SLIDE analysis to identify kNN latent cells followed our previously described method  . The steps implemented for PP-SLIDE are summarized below: To assess the intra-individual and inter-individual variability in kNN latent cells and to compare kNN latent cells reactivated following treatment with PMA/ionomycin , anti-CD3/CD28 , and Romidepsin/PEP005 , empirical cumulative distributions were calculated . The distributions of median distances in 32-dimensional space  corresponded to those between cells of the indicated pairs of samples . The median  distance over all cells in the first sample was computed for each cell in the second sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors . Then , similarly , the median  distance over all cells in the second sample was computed for each cell in the first sample using their corresponding 32-dimensional protein level vectors . This section describes in detail how FlowSOM was implemented to cluster the atlas and kNN latent cells , and how this information was used to demonstrate non-random distribution of kNN latent cells among memory CD4+ T cells .

         "Object manufacture in insects is typically inherited , and believed to be highly stereotyped . Optimization , the ability to select the functionally best material and modify it appropriately for a specific function , implies flexibility and is usually thought to be incompatible with inherited behaviour . Here , we show that tree-crickets optimize acoustic baffles , objects that are used to increase the effective loudness of mate-attraction calls . We quantified the acoustic efficiency of all baffles within the naturally feasible design space using finite-element modelling and found that design affects efficiency significantly . We tested the baffle-making behaviour of tree crickets in a series of experimental contexts . We found that given the opportunity , tree crickets optimised baffle acoustics; they selected the best sized object and modified it appropriately to make a near optimal baffle . Surprisingly , optimization could be achieved in a single attempt , and is likely to be achieved through an inherited yet highly accurate behavioural heuristic .\nAnimals produce conspicuous intraspecific communication signals whose intensity is maximised through sexual selection . Several insect species , including tree crickets , use sound to advertise for mates . The louder the call , the farther it travels and the more detectable and attractive it is to listening females ( Farris et al . , 1997; Forrest , 1991; Mhatre and Balakrishnan , 2007 ) . Several strategies exist to enhance the radiation of acoustic energy ( Bennet-Clark , 1999 ) , but the principal strategy insects use is to exploit the mechanical resonance either of adapted body parts , such as wings , or tymbal organs ( Mhatre et al . , 2012; Sueur et al . , 2006 ) , or of their immediate environment as mole crickets do with their calling burrow ( Daws et al . , 1996 ) . Tree crickets use a unique and distinct strategy to enhance the reach of their call; they make and use their own acoustic baffles ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) . Tree crickets , like other crickets , produce sound by rubbing raised forewings together and setting them into resonant vibration ( Mhatre et al . , 2012 ) . The sound that radiates from either side of the vibrating wing , however , is of opposite phase; positive pressure or compression in the direction of the wing’s motion and rarefaction or negative pressure on the other side ( see Video 1 ) . The wing’s sound production capability is thus made inefficient by ‘acoustic short-circuiting’ , whereby the two opposing sound waves emanating from the wing destructively interfere at its edges , thus reducing the total radiated sound pressure ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) ( Video 1 ) . This short-circuiting is particularly potent in tree crickets because their wings are small ( ~9 mm in length ) compared to the wavelength of their call ( ~110 mm at 3 . 1 kHz ) . One way to circumvent the limitation is to separate the front and back faces of the sound source ( the resonating wings ) thus precluding deleterious interaction between the two pressure waves . A baffle provides exactly such acoustic isolation ( Video 1 ) . In effect , male tree crickets cut a hole in a leaf to make a baffle . They then place their head and forelegs through the hole and call with their wings parallel to the leaf surface and centred within the hole ( Figure 1A , Video 2 ) . The leaf surface area provides acoustic isolation between the two sides , increasing call loudness ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975 ) . Given that the only function of the baffle is to prevent acoustic short circuiting , and not to resonate with the call , a tree cricket could use any leaf , or flat surface for this purpose . Here , we show that not all leaves confer equal benefits to sound radiation . Baffle design has a profound effect on radiation efficiency , and tree crickets can select the best leaf to make a near optimal baffle . We show that we can quantitatively predict the relationship between calling effort ( measured as wing vibration velocity ) , baffle design , and the resulting sound using biomechanical and acoustical measurements , and finite element analysis ( FEA ) . Using FEA models , we calculate and test the efficiency of tree crickets calling from different natural baffle designs , accounting for the complex geometries of cricket wings , their self-made baffles , and the leaves crickets chose to call from .\nTo characterize calling effort , wing vibrations during calling were measured using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry . Call was recorded simultaneously at a distance of 200 mm ( Figure 1A , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Measurements were made from freely behaving animals who sang when offered pre-made paper baffles ( Figure 1B , C , Materials and methods ) . The sound pressure produced by a vibrating structure is dependent on its space and time averaged velocity . It also depends on the size of the radiator and the wavelength of the sound being produced and is captured by a constant called the radiator resistance ( Hambric and Fahnline , 2007 ) . In tree crickets , the average velocity over the entire wing surface for a fixed period of one second was 0 . 13 ± 0 . 06 m·s−1 , and it produced an average sound pressure level ( SPL ) of 22 . 8 ± 11 . 0 mPa ( 60 . 4 ± 4 . 1 dB ) . Wing velocity was thus related to sound pressure level by a constant of 0 . 18 ± 0 . 03 Pa/m/s ( all measures are given as mean ±SD , n = 5 ) . To better understand the acoustic benefit offered by baffles , FEA models were developed of a cricket calling from a baffle identical to that used in the vibrometry experiment ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Vibration measurements served as inputs for FEA models and were used to compute the radiated SPL . Models predicted a bi-lobed acoustic field , consistent with previous acoustic measurements ( Figure 2 ) ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) . A male calling in free space with average wing velocity was predicted to produce an SPL of 14 . 6 mPa ( 57 . 2 dB at 200 mm ) ( Figure 2A ) , commensurate with field measurements ( Deb and Balakrishnan , 2014 ) . The virtual oval baffle increased SPL at the same distance to 24 . 9 mPa ( 61 . 9 dB ) ( Figure 2B ) , consistent with the actual sound pressures recorded in the experiments ( 22 . 8 ± 11 . 0 mPa or 60 . 4 ± 4 . 1 dB , n = 5 ) . Real baffles , however , vary given that crickets encounter leaves of different sizes and produce dissimilar holes . Hence , baffles are also expected to vary in their capacity to enhance call amplitude . Larger leaves and cricket-size baffle holes are thought to make the best baffles ( Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975 ) . Using FEA , we produced a quantitative comparison between different baffle designs using a metric we defined , sound radiation efficiency ( SRE ) . Males are expected to maximize the reach of their mate attraction calls per unit calling effort . Therefore , we defined SRE as the average absolute sound pressure around the calling cricket over a fixed volume normalised to wing vibration amplitude ( expressed in mPa/m∙s−1 , Materials and methods ) . SRE was calculated only for the range of leaf and hole sizes that encompasses natural variation ( Figure 3A , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . This could also be considered an index of male conspicuousness in terms of active acoustic space ( Deb and Balakrishnan , 2014; Mhatre and Balakrishnan , 2006 ) , and all else being equal , the volume of each male’s active space is covariant with SRE . We found that SRE increased with leaf size but became asymptotic for leaves longer than 100 mm , i . e . longer than most natural leaves ( Figure 3A , B ) . Thus , males choosing larger leaves would always make better baffles under natural conditions ( Figure 3A ) . FEA also predicted that a baffle hole of length ~10 mm , the same as the model wing length ( and the size of a typical male cricket wing ) , was optimal ( Figure 3A ) . The maximum SRE of 386 . 3 mPa/m∙s−1 was achieved by a baffle made with a leaf 110 . 2 mm long , with a centrally located hole of length 9 . 7 mm . Having constructed a geometrically-resolved map of SRE for feasible baffles , we investigated whether male tree crickets optimized the acoustics of their baffles . SRE with a baffle of any size is higher than unbaffled calling ( Figure 3A , B ) , and the expectation is that males should always baffle given an opportunity . In natural populations observed over three field seasons , however , the probability of finding a baffling male was as low as 26% ( 27 of 105 males observed calling ) and while baffling males tended to be on larger leaves , there was wide variation in leaf size ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . Thus baffled-calling is not a stereotyped and obligate calling behaviour; tree cricket males must decide whether to call with or without a baffle . In the wild , large leaves that can make acoustically optimal baffles are extremely rare and search costs are likely to be high ( Figure 3B ) . However , if we eliminate search costs , the propensity to make a baffle may increase with leaf size , a hypothesis that we tested under controlled laboratory conditions . Males were offered leaves of four size classes , one leaf at a time , over four nights . Each night , they could choose either to make a baffle or to call from the edge of the leaf . In this situation , in the absence of search costs , calling males were only balancing the effort expended in making a baffle against the increased SRE . Baffling probability varied depending on the leaf size ( Cochran’s Q: 63 . 9 , df = 3 , p<0 . 001 , Figure 3B ) and was significantly different between extra-large and large leaf sizes ( Mc-Nemars χ2 = 4 . 9 , df = 1 , p=0 . 02 ) , large and medium leaf sizes ( Mc-Nemars χ2 = 15 . 05 , df = 1 , p<0 . 001 ) and medium and small leaf sizes ( Mc-Nemars χ2 = 5 . 14 , df = 1 , p=0 . 02 ) . The larger the leaves , the more likely the crickets were to make a baffle ( Figure 3B ) . However , the probability of making a baffle approached 50% only with leaves between 61 and 69 mm long , where SRE increased by 54% . Even with the largest leaves , baffling probability did not exceed 67% , and 33% of the males missed the opportunity to more than double their SRE and thus their active acoustic space ( Figure 3B ) . Next , we tested whether males preferred larger leaves or whether they could also select the best leaf when given a choice . Tree crickets could indeed select the leaves that yielded higher SREs . 19 males were presented with a choice between a small ( 61 . 2 ± 4 . 8 mm ) and a large leaf ( 115 . 2 ± 11 . 7 mm ) of their host plant ( Hyptis suaveolens ) . Males always selected the leaves yielding the higher SRE . All males that made a baffle ( 15 of 19 ) used the larger leaf . The holes they made were also acoustically optimal in size ( 10 . 0 ± 1 . 9 mm , n = 15 ) . Thus , given the opportunity males would indeed optimize the SRE of their baffles in terms of both selecting the appropriate materials , i . e . the largest leaf and then modifying it appropriately i . e . cutting a hole of acoustically optimal size ( Figure 3A ) . Males , however , did not make holes at the exact centre of leaves ( Figure 1E ) . We used our FEA to further explore whether eccentric hole positions came at a cost to SRE . An SRE map was constructed by varying hole position across an average leaf in the large size class . This map revealed that SRE was highest at the leaf centre and decreased for eccentric hole positions ( Figure 3C , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , eccentric hole positions come at a cost to SRE . A central-hole baffle on the smaller leaf would have achieved an SRE of 226 . 3 ± 20 . 9 mPa/m∙s−1 . On the large leaf , it would achieve an SRE of 375 . 1 ± 11 . 1 mPa/m∙s−1 . The radiation efficiency of the real baffles made by the crickets was 332 . 2 ± 30 . 3 mPa/m∙s−1 i . e . 88 . 6 ± 7 . 6% of the maximum achievable SRE with a skew towards higher efficiencies ( Figure 3D ) ( mean ± SD , range = 72 . 8% to 97 . 7% , n = 15 all measures ) . Although theoretically optimal , a central hole position is impractical as it cuts through the midrib . This compromises the leaf’s structural rigidity and its main water transport system , causing it to wilt , thus reducing the lifetime of the baffle . Additionally , cutting through the rigid midrib may be mechanically difficult . Indeed , closer observation of baffle holes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) showed that males never cut through major leaf veins . Surprisingly , most males made only one hole and thus made a baffle in a single attempt , without any progressive trial and error optimization of baffle design . There was , however , one exception , one male made two holes ( Figure 4A ) . The first hole was far from the centre and achieved 72 . 1% of the maximum possible SRE . The male then made another hole closer to the centre which on its own would have achieved 96 . 9% of the maximum SRE . Why did the other males make no effort to boost their call amplitude further ? For instance , mole crickets gradually restructure their burrows to bring burrow resonance closer to call frequency ( Daws et al . , 1996; Bennet-Clark , 1987 ) . Baffles however , are unique and cannot be ‘edited’ unlike cavities; once a hole has been cut in a leaf , it cannot be erased or repositioned . Only a new hole can be made . Here we show that cutting a new hole entails the risk of making a sub-optimal baffle by reducing current SRE through increased acoustic short-circuiting . We studied the effect of a second hole on SRE by simulating a scenario where an eccentric hole was abandoned and a second , optimally centred hole was constructed . The map depicts at each primary hole position , the percent change in SRE if the male abandoned that position and made a centrally positioned secondary hole ( Figure 4B ) . A second baffle hole would accrue a large increase in SRE only if the primary hole was near a leaf margin and produced very low SRE to begin with ( Figure 4B ) . The only two-holed baffle observed was from a male that made an unusually eccentric primary baffle hole ( highlighted in Figure 4B ) . In this example , making a more central hole improved SRE by 37 . 5% , despite increased acoustic short-circuiting . Interestingly , our simulations predict that the more central the primary hole , the less beneficial a secondary baffle hole becomes and in the central zone of the leaf , a second hole becomes deleterious to SRE ( Figure 4B ) . This is because the second hole would fuse with the primary hole effectively enlarging it to a suboptimal size ( Figure 3A ) . Our observations show that the first holes made by males are already close to the centre; if they made a second central hole , six males would have decreased SRE by 6 . 73 ± 2 . 77% and the other nine males stood to increase SRE but only by 19 . 17 ± 11 . 15% ( Figure 4B ) . This finding supports the notion that crickets position their baffle holes with geometric optimality , but also avoid jeopardising this optimality . This may be why large , and sought-after , leaves only ever have one baffle hole . Near-optimal SREs are achieved by most males at the first baffling attempt ( Figure 3D ) and most attempts at improvement can be predicted as being futile ( Figure 4B ) .\nThe question naturally arises as to how tree crickets make acoustically optimal baffles in a single attempt ? In the tree cricket genus Oecanthus , baffle making is common ( Forrest , 1991; Prozesky-Schulze et al . , 1975; Forrest , 1982 ) and expressed by many individuals within the species , suggesting that it is an inherited trait . Thus , the optimization procedure may also be ‘hard-wired’ , rather than learned and may have developed via sexual selection . We surmise that tree crickets accomplish acoustic optimization using hard-wired heuristics or ‘rules of thumb’ ( Hutchinson and Gigerenzer , 2005; Cross and Jackson , 2005 ) , which require them to make a series of choices . If a male decides to make a baffle , three simple rules can produce an optimal baffle in a single attempt: ( i ) find the largest available leaf , ( ii ) place the hole as close to the centre of the leaf as possible and ( iii ) cut a hole that can just accommodate wings ( Figure 3 , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . These rules encode sufficient information to capture the shape of SRE landscape within baffle design space into a simple , yet high-accuracy heuristic that always produces the baffle with the highest possible SRE . The accuracy of this heuristic is higher than observed in the progressive optimization procedure observed in mole crickets burrows which always perform just sub-optimally ( Daws et al . , 1996 ) . At 3 kHz , the burrow resonance is always higher than call frequency at 2 . 5 kHz and the actual burrow dimensions do not fit optimal dimensions for sound radiation at either frequency ( Daws et al . , 1996 ) . The explanation for this sub-optimal performance lies in Weber’s law , whereby sensory systems cannot distinguish between small differences in signal amplitude or frequency at high signal amplitudes due to receptor saturation and habituation ( Imaizumi and Pollack , 2001; Imaizumi and Pollack , 1999; Givois and Pollack , 2000 ) . This neurophysiological limitation is likely to be a common driver of suboptimal performance in any method that uses feedback for optimization ( Nachev et al . , 2017 ) . It is possible that the tree crickets learn the SRE landscape , however , we believe that this is unlikely since the opportunity for learning is small due to life-history and time constraints . Tree crickets call only as adults , and for only a few hours each day . Finding and testing each leaf size with every baffle position to find the optimal solution , especially with large leaf sizes being so rare , would require a formidably large number of learning trials and considerable memory . Another possibility is that they can abstract these general rules from a few trials . While we believe that inherited heuristic optimization is a more parsimonious explanation , however , repeating these experiments with naïve males would provide a more definitive answer . Heuristics are , in essence , rational search methods ( McFarland , 1991 ) . When an object or behaviour has different efficiencies depending on a set of parameters , heuristics guide the search for the optimal position in the landscape described by these efficiencies ( McFarland , 1991 ) . Therefore , using a heuristic demonstrates the implicit or explicit knowledge that a behaviour can be accomplished in multiple ways and that each way differs in performance . Therefore heuristics , whether invertebrate , or vertebrate including humans , inherited or learned , imply not only an expectation of performance variability , but also choice and behavioural flexibility . One context in which this may be important is tool use; the conventional view is that invertebrates generally inherit tool use behaviour ( Hunt et al . , 2013 ) and hence have highly stereotyped tool use , whereas vertebrates inherit a propensity to ‘innovate’ tool behaviour and hence have flexible tool use ( Shettleworth , 2009 , 2010 ) . Inflexible or stereotyped tool use implies that optimization would not be possible for any invertebrate tool-users . It is suggested that baffles may be tools or borderline tools ( Bentley-Condit and Smith , 2010; Pierce , 1986; Crain et al . , 2013 ) , therefore baffle optimization suggests that inherited mechanisms such as heuristics may enable flexibility and even optimization in invertebrate tool use . Flexible tool use has indeed already been observed in invertebrates , first in cephalopods ( Finn et al . , 2009 ) and more recently , from bees ( Loukola et al . , 2017; Alem et al . , 2016 ) . Bees have a large capacity for learning , which enables significant behavioural flexibility , and it has now been shown that bees can be taught to use tools . They can even improve upon the tool use demonstrated to them ( Loukola et al . , 2017; Alem et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , we argue that the behavioural flexibility that enables bees to improve upon demonstrated tool use emerges from a heuristic strategy . Bumble bees were trained to roll a ball into a specific position to gain a reward . The bees spontaneously used the ball nearest to the target even when they had been trained on a different ball ( Loukola et al . , 2017 ) , an excellent example of the well-known greedy heuristic ( Cormen et al . , 2009 ) in which the nearest solution is the most preferred . Indeed , tree cricket behaviour shows that even inherited heuristic mechanisms may enable flexibility and even optimization , prompting a re-examination of invertebrate tool use . In summary , tree cricket males that call from the edge of leaves tend to have low efficiencies ( 94–171 mPa/m∙s−1 depending on leaf size ) and those that make baffles can achieve much higher efficiencies ( 91–386 mPa/m∙s−1 over same size range ) . Thus , by finding the largest leaf and making a near optimal baffle , a male tree cricket can increase his active acoustic area by as much as four times ( 12 dB ) , greatly increasing his chances of attracting a mate . The increase in call amplitude that baffling confers can work in two ways . Baffling can either add to the existing variability , broadening the distribution of male call amplitudes or it can function as a compensatory mechanism: males unable to call loudly may make a baffle instead . Behavioural experiments show that despite the advantage baffles confer , only a few animals choose to make a baffle under natural conditions . Non-host plants with larger leaves are available to the tree crickets , yet are rarely used . The rarity of baffling suggests that manufacturing a baffle may be a costly activity ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , all mole cricket males stereotypically make acoustic burrow chambers that resonate and boost call amplitude ( Hill et al . , 2006; Hill , 1999 ) . The low incidence of baffling and high variability in baffle design observed in natural baffling behaviour ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) are quite distinct . Baffling may be used to garner even higher mate-attraction benefits on males whose high quality or condition already allows them to make larger energetic investments . Thus , baffle making may represent a unique system in which ‘good’ males use an acoustically optimized object to further enhance their mate-attraction signal . Another enticing possibility is that baffle-making may have evolved as an alternative strategy allowing smaller males , or those in poorer condition , to sound bigger or louder than they actually are .\nVibration velocities from the forewings of freely calling tree cricket ( Oecanthus henryi ) males calling from baffles were measured using a micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometer ( Polytec , PSV-400 , Waldbronn , Germany ) with a Polytec PSV-I-400 scanning head fitted with a close-up attachment , and digitized using the Polytec Scanning Vibrometer software ( version 8 . 8 , Polytec Gmbh , Waldbronn , Germany ) through a data acquisition board ( National Instruments , PCI-6110 , Austin , Texas , USA ) . Acoustic measurements were made simultaneously using two calibrated 1/8th inch precision pressure microphones ( Brüel and Kjær , 4138 , [frequency range 6 Hz to 140 kHz] , Naerum , Denmark ) and preamplifier ( Brüel and Kjær , 2633 , Naerum , Denmark ) . All data were collected at a sampling frequency of 128 kHz for 1 . 024 s . The microphones have a flat response in the measured frequency range . All experiments were carried out on a vibration isolation table ( Technical Manufacturing Corp , 784-443-12R , Peabody , Massachusetts , USA ) . The experimental set-up ( Figure 1E , D ) allowed the calling cricket to be oriented such that the upraised wings were normal to the path of the laser beam . The two microphones were placed coaxially ≈ 20 mm below the path of the laser beam , at a distance of ±200 mm from the center of the turn-table , hence from the position of the calling male . The laser was aligned using a video feed and it could then be remotely positioned by the vibrometer software across a grid of points placed over the wings of the calling insect . An average of 245 measurement points across the wing surface were used per animal leading to an average scan duration of just over 4 min . Paper baffles ( made using white 80 g/m2 paper ) were used in the study . These premade baffles were oval in shape and had a length of 68 . 6 ± 3 . 6 mm and width of 40 . 8 ± 2 . 2 mm on average ( n = 5 ) and the holes were 17 . 4 ± 1 . 9 mm in length and 11 . 4 ± 1 . 9 mm in width ( n = 5 ) . During calling , the peak baffle surface displacements were considerably lower ( 1/600th ) than the wings leading us to conclude that the baffles did not act as significant secondary acoustic radiators . The sound pressure radiating from a vibrating body depends on the space-time average of the body’s vibration velocity ( Hambric and Fahnline , 2007 ) . The peak value , which we also report in the main paper , is taken from the point of maximum deflection of the wing , as shown in Figure 1A . The rest of the wing does not move with this magnitude . The resulting sound is a consequence of the whole wings movement not just of this one point . If we used the peak value alone , the magnitude of wing vibration would be over-estimated . Taking an average in space resolves this issue . Since pressure is conventionally measured after integration over a fixed time period for amplitude-modulated signals , to be comparable , we also performed a time average of the vibration velocity . Hence we calculated the space-time average of the velocity in the z-direction ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) from all the measurement points placed over the entire surface of the wing during calling . Finite element analysis ( FEA ) models of a cricket calling in free space or on different baffles were created to investigate pressures produced by vibrating cricket wings . FEA modeling was carried out using a commercial package ( COMSOL 4 . 3 , Burlington , Massachusetts , USA ) . The acoustics module was used implementing harmonic analysis with the Helmholtz equation as the governing equation . Oecanthus henryi males are observed to call and manufacture baffles from Hyptis suaveolens leaves in the wild . To better understand their interactions with the leaves , we performed three independent studies .",
         "Male tree crickets produce sounds at a specific pitch to attract females . The louder the call , the further the sound travels and the more females he can attract . But making loud sounds is difficult for small animals like insects . To produce sounds , tree crickets rub their wings together and set them into vibration . As the wings vibrate , their motion creates changes in the surrounding air pressure , which is perceived as sound . As the wings move forwards , they compress the air in front of them and thin the air behind them , working much like the membrane of a loudspeaker . However , when the compressed and thinned air meet at the edges of the wings , the sound cancels out . This problem is known as acoustic short-circuiting , and the smaller the wings , the larger this effect and the less efficient the broadcast of sound becomes . Tree crickets overcome acoustic short-circuiting by making baffles , for which they cut a hole near the centre of a leaf . The cricket then sings from inside this hole with its wings flat against the leaf surface , so that the sound has to travel to the leaf edge before short-circuiting . Not all baffles work equally well though , and scientists are interested to know whether tree crickets know how to make the best possible baffle to attract more females . To find out what makes an ideal baffle , Mhatre et al . first measured the wing vibrations and sounds of real tree crickets , and used them to simulate a cricket singing from different baffles . From these tests , three simple rules emerged that led to the best baffle: use the largest available leaf , make a hole the size of the wings , and place it at the centre of the leaf . Mhatre et al . then discovered that the crickets did not make a baffle every time – only when the leaves were large enough . This suggests that rather than being solely ‘robotic’ in their behaviour and the use of objects , insects can behave flexibly . When faced with a choice between two leaves , the crickets followed the same three decision rules that the scientists had discovered , and achieved near optimal baffles . Insects are thought to only be able to gradually improve an object or behaviour , but rarely to optimize it . However , the discovery that tree crickets can make optimal acoustic baffles in a single attempt means that we are only beginning to unravel the underappreciated abilities of insects . An enticing next step will be to see whether the creation of baffles could be considered as tool-making .",

         "Here , we show that tree-crickets optimize acoustic baffles , objects that are used to increase the effective loudness of mate-attraction calls . We quantified the acoustic efficiency of all baffles within the naturally feasible design space using finite-element modelling and found that design affects efficiency significantly . We tested the baffle-making behaviour of tree crickets in a series of experimental contexts . We found that given the opportunity , tree crickets optimised baffle acoustics; they selected the best sized object and modified it appropriately to make a near optimal baffle . Surprisingly , optimization could be achieved in a single attempt , and is likely to be achieved through an inherited yet highly accurate behavioural heuristic . Several insect species , including tree crickets , use sound to advertise for mates . Several strategies exist to enhance the radiation of acoustic energy  , but the principal strategy insects use is to exploit the mechanical resonance either of adapted body parts , such as wings , or tymbal organs  , or of their immediate environment as mole crickets do with their calling burrow  . Tree crickets use a unique and distinct strategy to enhance the reach of their call; they make and use their own acoustic baffles  . The sound that radiates from either side of the vibrating wing , however , is of opposite phase; positive pressure or compression in the direction of the wing’s motion and rarefaction or negative pressure on the other side  . The wing’s sound production capability is thus made inefficient by ‘acoustic short-circuiting’ , whereby the two opposing sound waves emanating from the wing destructively interfere at its edges , thus reducing the total radiated sound pressure   . This short-circuiting is particularly potent in tree crickets because their wings are small  compared to the wavelength of their call  . One way to circumvent the limitation is to separate the front and back faces of the sound source  thus precluding deleterious interaction between the two pressure waves . They then place their head and forelegs through the hole and call with their wings parallel to the leaf surface and centred within the hole  . The leaf surface area provides acoustic isolation between the two sides , increasing call loudness  . Given that the only function of the baffle is to prevent acoustic short circuiting , and not to resonate with the call , a tree cricket could use any leaf , or flat surface for this purpose . Baffle design has a profound effect on radiation efficiency , and tree crickets can select the best leaf to make a near optimal baffle . We show that we can quantitatively predict the relationship between calling effort  , baffle design , and the resulting sound using biomechanical and acoustical measurements , and finite element analysis  . Using FEA models , we calculate and test the efficiency of tree crickets calling from different natural baffle designs , accounting for the complex geometries of cricket wings , their self-made baffles , and the leaves crickets chose to call from . To characterize calling effort , wing vibrations during calling were measured using scanning laser Doppler vibrometry . Measurements were made from freely behaving animals who sang when offered pre-made paper baffles  . The sound pressure produced by a vibrating structure is dependent on its space and time averaged velocity . It also depends on the size of the radiator and the wavelength of the sound being produced and is captured by a constant called the radiator resistance  . In tree crickets , the average velocity over the entire wing surface for a fixed period of one second was 0 . To better understand the acoustic benefit offered by baffles , FEA models were developed of a cricket calling from a baffle identical to that used in the vibrometry experiment  . Vibration measurements served as inputs for FEA models and were used to compute the radiated SPL . A male calling in free space with average wing velocity was predicted to produce an SPL of 14 . The virtual oval baffle increased SPL at the same distance to 24 . Using FEA , we produced a quantitative comparison between different baffle designs using a metric we defined , sound radiation efficiency  . We found that SRE increased with leaf size but became asymptotic for leaves longer than 100 mm , i . FEA also predicted that a baffle hole of length ~10 mm , the same as the model wing length  , was optimal  . 2 mm long , with a centrally located hole of length 9 . In natural populations observed over three field seasons , however , the probability of finding a baffling male was as low as 26%  and while baffling males tended to be on larger leaves , there was wide variation in leaf size  . In the wild , large leaves that can make acoustically optimal baffles are extremely rare and search costs are likely to be high  . Males were offered leaves of four size classes , one leaf at a time , over four nights . In this situation , in the absence of search costs , calling males were only balancing the effort expended in making a baffle against the increased SRE . Baffling probability varied depending on the leaf size  and was significantly different between extra-large and large leaf sizes  , large and medium leaf sizes  and medium and small leaf sizes  . However , the probability of making a baffle approached 50% only with leaves between 61 and 69 mm long , where SRE increased by 54% . Next , we tested whether males preferred larger leaves or whether they could also select the best leaf when given a choice . Males always selected the leaves yielding the higher SRE . All males that made a baffle  used the larger leaf . Thus , given the opportunity males would indeed optimize the SRE of their baffles in terms of both selecting the appropriate materials , i . We used our FEA to further explore whether eccentric hole positions came at a cost to SRE . There was , however , one exception , one male made two holes  . Here we show that cutting a new hole entails the risk of making a sub-optimal baffle by reducing current SRE through increased acoustic short-circuiting . We studied the effect of a second hole on SRE by simulating a scenario where an eccentric hole was abandoned and a second , optimally centred hole was constructed . The map depicts at each primary hole position , the percent change in SRE if the male abandoned that position and made a centrally positioned secondary hole  . The only two-holed baffle observed was from a male that made an unusually eccentric primary baffle hole  . Our observations show that the first holes made by males are already close to the centre; if they made a second central hole , six males would have decreased SRE by 6 . This finding supports the notion that crickets position their baffle holes with geometric optimality , but also avoid jeopardising this optimality . Thus , the optimization procedure may also be ‘hard-wired’ , rather than learned and may have developed via sexual selection . We surmise that tree crickets accomplish acoustic optimization using hard-wired heuristics or ‘rules of thumb’  , which require them to make a series of choices . If a male decides to make a baffle , three simple rules can produce an optimal baffle in a single attempt:  find the largest available leaf ,  place the hole as close to the centre of the leaf as possible and  cut a hole that can just accommodate wings  . The accuracy of this heuristic is higher than observed in the progressive optimization procedure observed in mole crickets burrows which always perform just sub-optimally  . At 3 kHz , the burrow resonance is always higher than call frequency at 2 . The explanation for this sub-optimal performance lies in Weber’s law , whereby sensory systems cannot distinguish between small differences in signal amplitude or frequency at high signal amplitudes due to receptor saturation and habituation  . This neurophysiological limitation is likely to be a common driver of suboptimal performance in any method that uses feedback for optimization  . Therefore , using a heuristic demonstrates the implicit or explicit knowledge that a behaviour can be accomplished in multiple ways and that each way differs in performance . Therefore heuristics , whether invertebrate , or vertebrate including humans , inherited or learned , imply not only an expectation of performance variability , but also choice and behavioural flexibility . One context in which this may be important is tool use; the conventional view is that invertebrates generally inherit tool use behaviour  and hence have highly stereotyped tool use , whereas vertebrates inherit a propensity to ‘innovate’ tool behaviour and hence have flexible tool use  . It is suggested that baffles may be tools or borderline tools  , therefore baffle optimization suggests that inherited mechanisms such as heuristics may enable flexibility and even optimization in invertebrate tool use . Flexible tool use has indeed already been observed in invertebrates , first in cephalopods  and more recently , from bees  . Bees have a large capacity for learning , which enables significant behavioural flexibility , and it has now been shown that bees can be taught to use tools . They can even improve upon the tool use demonstrated to them  . Indeed , we argue that the behavioural flexibility that enables bees to improve upon demonstrated tool use emerges from a heuristic strategy . The bees spontaneously used the ball nearest to the target even when they had been trained on a different ball  , an excellent example of the well-known greedy heuristic  in which the nearest solution is the most preferred . Indeed , tree cricket behaviour shows that even inherited heuristic mechanisms may enable flexibility and even optimization , prompting a re-examination of invertebrate tool use . Thus , by finding the largest leaf and making a near optimal baffle , a male tree cricket can increase his active acoustic area by as much as four times  , greatly increasing his chances of attracting a mate . Baffling can either add to the existing variability , broadening the distribution of male call amplitudes or it can function as a compensatory mechanism: males unable to call loudly may make a baffle instead . Behavioural experiments show that despite the advantage baffles confer , only a few animals choose to make a baffle under natural conditions . Non-host plants with larger leaves are available to the tree crickets , yet are rarely used . Baffling may be used to garner even higher mate-attraction benefits on males whose high quality or condition already allows them to make larger energetic investments . Thus , baffle making may represent a unique system in which ‘good’ males use an acoustically optimized object to further enhance their mate-attraction signal . Another enticing possibility is that baffle-making may have evolved as an alternative strategy allowing smaller males , or those in poorer condition , to sound bigger or louder than they actually are . Vibration velocities from the forewings of freely calling tree cricket  males calling from baffles were measured using a micro-scanning laser Doppler vibrometer  with a Polytec PSV-I-400 scanning head fitted with a close-up attachment , and digitized using the Polytec Scanning Vibrometer software  through a data acquisition board  . Acoustic measurements were made simultaneously using two calibrated 1/8th inch precision pressure microphones  and preamplifier  . The two microphones were placed coaxially ≈ 20 mm below the path of the laser beam , at a distance of ±200 mm from the center of the turn-table , hence from the position of the calling male . The laser was aligned using a video feed and it could then be remotely positioned by the vibrometer software across a grid of points placed over the wings of the calling insect . An average of 245 measurement points across the wing surface were used per animal leading to an average scan duration of just over 4 min . During calling , the peak baffle surface displacements were considerably lower  than the wings leading us to conclude that the baffles did not act as significant secondary acoustic radiators . The peak value , which we also report in the main paper , is taken from the point of maximum deflection of the wing , as shown in Figure 1A . Since pressure is conventionally measured after integration over a fixed time period for amplitude-modulated signals , to be comparable , we also performed a time average of the vibration velocity . Finite element analysis  models of a cricket calling in free space or on different baffles were created to investigate pressures produced by vibrating cricket wings . The acoustics module was used implementing harmonic analysis with the Helmholtz equation as the governing equation . To better understand their interactions with the leaves , we performed three independent studies . "

         "Missense mutations of valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) cause an autosomal dominant disease known as inclusion body myopathy , Paget disease with frontotemporal dementia ( IBMPFD ) and other neurodegenerative disorders . The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment . We show that endogenous VCP negatively regulates Mitofusin , which is required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion . Because 90% of IBMPFD patients have myopathy , we generated an in vivo IBMPFD model in adult Drosophila muscle , which recapitulates disease pathologies . We show that common VCP disease mutants act as hyperactive alleles with respect to regulation of Mitofusin . Importantly , VCP inhibitors suppress mitochondrial defects , muscle tissue damage and cell death associated with IBMPFD models in Drosophila . These inhibitors also suppress mitochondrial fusion and respiratory defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . These results suggest that VCP disease mutants cause IBMPFD through a gain-of-function mechanism , and that VCP inhibitors have therapeutic value .\nIBMPFD is an autosomal dominant disease that afflicts multiple body systems ( Kimonis et al . , 2008a ) . 90% of IBMPFD patients display skeletal muscle weakness ( myopathy ) , the primary and earliest symptom of IBMPFD ( Weihl et al . , 2009 ) . With progression of the disease , 50% of patients will develop Paget’s disease of bone , affecting the skull , spine , hips and long bones of all four limbs . One-third of the patients will also develop frontotemporal dementia ( Weihl et al . , 2009; Kimonis et al . , 2008b ) . Single missense mutations of p97/cdc48/Valosin-containing protein ( VCP ) cause fully penetrant IBMPFD ( Watts et al . , 2004 ) . VCP mutations are also associated with 1–2% of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , familial hereditary spastic paraplegia ( HSP ) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2 ( CMT2 ) disease ( Abramzon et al . , 2012; de Bot et al . , 2012; Gonzalez et al . , 2014 ) . VCP encodes a highly conserved and abundant AAA+ ATPase which participates in multiple cellular processes ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . Human p97/VCP and its Drosophila homologue have 85% identity and 93% similarity in protein sequence . VCP has three major domains: the regulatory N domain , and the D1 and D2 ATPase domains . VCP hexameric rings utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to promote protein and RNA homeostasis , often by directly or indirectly modifying the fate of ubiquitin-labeled proteins ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . VCP functions in multiple contexts that include protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum ( Ye et al . , 2001; Shih and Hsueh , 2016 ) , chromatin modification ( Puumalainen et al . , 2014; Dobrynin et al . , 2011; Vaz et al . , 2013 ) , endolysosomal sorting ( Ritz et al . , 2011 ) , membrane fusion ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) , autophagosome/lyosome function ( Ju et al . , 2009; Johnson et al . , 2015 ) , ER protein translocation ( DeLaBarre et al . , 2006; Weihl et al . , 2006 ) , formation of stress granules ( Buchan et al . , 2013 ) and ciliogenesis ( Raman et al . , 2015 ) . VCP interacts with a number of co-factors to regulate these processes ( Meyer and Weihl , 2014; Meyer et al . , 2012 ) , making it challenging to identify the molecular basis of phenotypes associated with disease mutations . Disease-causing , single missense mutations of VCP are mainly located in the N-terminal half of the protein , either in the N domain or the D1 domain . Among them , the R155H mutation is the most frequently identified in IBMPFD patients , while the A232E mutation is associated with the most severe clinical manifestation ( Kimonis et al . , 2008a; Ritson et al . , 2010 ) . In vitro assays show that disease mutants have enhanced ATPase activity ( Weihl et al . , 2006; Zhang et al . , 2015; Niwa et al . , 2012; Manno et al . , 2010; Tang and Xia , 2013 ) . However , because VCP assembles as a hexamer , it is controversial whether disease mutants with increased ATPase activity cause disease through a dominant-active ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) or dominant-negative mechanism ( Ritz et al . , 2011; Ju et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2013; Bartolome et al . , 2013; Kimura et al . , 2013 ) . VCP disease mutants predominantly affect organs that have a high level of energy expenditure , such as brain and muscle . Mitochondria provide the bulk of the ATP to these tissues through oxidative phosphorylation , and mitochondrial functional defects , including mitochondrial uncoupling and decreased ATP production , are observed in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts ( Bartolome et al . , 2013; Nalbandian et al . , 2015a ) . Abnormal mitochondria are also observed in transgenic VCP disease mutant R155H mice as well as VCP R155H knock-in mice ( Custer et al . , 2010; Nalbandian et al . , 2012 ) . These observations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is important for the pathogenesis of IBMPFD , but the mechanism by which VCP mutation alters mitochondrial function is not clear . Mitochondrial morphology is controlled by dynamic cycles of fusion , controlled by Mitofusin ( Mfn ) , and fission , regulated by DRP1 ( Chan , 2012 ) . Recent studies have uncovered the roles of mitochondria fusion and fission defects in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative disorders ( Davies et al . , 2007; Chen et al . , 2003; Wakabayashi et al . , 2009 ) , particularly Parkinson's disease , the second most common neurodegenerative disorder ( Guo , 2012; Pickrell and Youle , 2015; Deng et al . , 2008; Yang et al . , 2008; Poole et al . , 2008 , 2010; Park et al . , 2009 ) . In mammals , homologous proteins Mitofusin 1 and 2 ( Mfn1 and Mfn2 ) mediate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion , with loss of function of Mfn 1 and 2 resulting in fragmented mitochondria and multiple defects in mitochondrial function ( Chen et al . , 2003b ) . In Hela cells , VCP promotes Mfn 1 degradation ( Xu et al . , 2011 ) . VCP also mediates Mfn 1 and 2 degradation when mitophagy is stimulated in mammalian cells , and overexpression of VCP in Drosophila leads to downregulation of a tagged Mfn-transgene ( Kim et al . , 2013; Kimura et al . , 2013 ) . These observations led us to investigate the mitochondrial basis and molecular mechanisms for VCP disease mutants function using both Drosophila and IBMPFD patient cell models . As IBMPFD show the highest penetrance in muscle , with 90% of patients manifesting phenotypes in this tissue , we generated Drosophila models of IBMPFD in muscle , which recapitulate disease pathologies . We provide evidence in both Drosophila and human patient cells that VCP disease mutants have an enhanced ability to promote Mfn degradation , loss of which is associated with defects in mitochondrial fusion and physiology . Consistent with the hypothesis that VCP disease phenotypes are due to increased activity on substrates , we find that VCP ATPase activity inhibitors such as NMS-873 and ML240 can significantly rescue mitochondrial defects , disrupted muscle integrity and muscle cell death in vivo in Drosophila , and mitochondrial fusion and respiration defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts .\nSince VCP disease mutants have dramatic muscle phenotypes in humans and mouse models , and these are associated with defects in mitochondrial structure and function , we first examined the consequences of manipulating VCP levels . The Drosophila adult indirect flight muscle ( IFM ) is a non-essential , post-mitotic , and energy-intense tissue containing a high density of mitochondria . It also shows strong and consistent phenotypes in response to altered expression of genes required for mitochondrial fusion , fission and quality control ( Clark et al . , 2006; Deng et al . , 2008; Yang et al . , 2008; Poole et al . , 2008; Park et al . , 2009; Poole et al . , 2010; Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Using the UAS-Gal4 system ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) , we expressed VCP under the control of an IFM promoter derived from the flightin gene we previously generated ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . While expression of VCP under the control of the pan-muscle Gal4 drivers 24B-Gal4 or Mef2-Gal4 resulted in 100% adult lethality , expression of wildtype VCP under IFM control , which provides a pulse of expression in late pupal stages and early adulthood , gave rise to viable flies with intact and healthy muscle following adult eclosion . We utilized mitochondrially targeted GFP ( mitoGFP ) as a mitochondrial marker , as well as transmission electron microscopy ( EM ) at the ultrastructual levels for enhanced resolution particularly for cristae morphology . In 2-day-old flies , expression of VCP results in muscle with small mitochondria with intact cristae ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B’ ) . Similar phenotypes are also observed in muscle from 6-day-old VCP-expressing flies ( Figure 1A–B’’ ) . Conversely , expression of UAS-VCP RNAi under IFM control ( VCP RNAi flies ) results in mitochondria with an elongated phenotype ( Figure 1C–C’’ , Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and C’ ) . Two independent VCP RNAi lines were utilized and both showed significant knockdown ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 006 To explore the generality of VCP’s ability to regulate mitochondrial morphology we also examined mitochondrial morphology phenotypes of a vcp loss-of-function mutation . vcp null mutants in Drosophila are embryonic lethal ( Ruden et al . , 2000 ) . The indirect flight muscle is a cellular syncytium and therefore cannot be used for mosaic analysis . As an alternative , we focused on the Drosophila female germline , in which a vcp loss-of-function mutant can be monitored in individual nurse cells , which are relatively large and offer great resolution for examining mitochondrial morphology . vcpK15502 is a strong loss-of-function allele that has a P element insertion at the 5’-UTR of Drosophila VCP gene ( Chang et al . , 2011; Ruden et al . , 2000 ) and has been used to generate vcp loss-of-function clones in imaginal discs ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . The Drosophila ovary consists of numerous developing egg chambers . Each egg chamber develops from stage 1 to stage 14 and has three types of cells: follicle cells , nurse cells and the oocyte ( Frydman and Spradling , 2001 ) . The germline complement of each egg chamber ( 15 nurse cells and the oocyte ) derives from four sequential divisions of a single daughter of a stem cell . We utilized the FLP/FRT system ( Theodosiou and Xu , 1998 ) to create mitotic recombinants in which nurse cells were either wildtype ( +/+ ) , heterozygous ( vcpK15502/+ ) or homozygous ( vcpK15502/vcpK15502 ) for the vcp loss-of-function mutation ( Figure 1D ) . In this system wildtype and heterozygous vcp loss-of-function mutant cells carry 2 or 1 copies of ubi-mRFP . NLS ( RFP ) respectively , whereas the homozygous vcp mutant cells are RFP negative ( Figure 1E ) . Anti-ATP5A antibody is used to visualize mitochondrial morphology in nurse cells ( Figure 1E’ ) . Mitochondria in wildtype and heterozygous vcp mutant cells have a punctate morphology ( Figure 1F and G ) . In contrast , in homozygous vcp loss-of-function mutants mitochondria are more tubular and clumped ( Figure 1H and I ) . Together , these results suggest that endogenous VCP negatively regulates mitochondrial fusion or positively regulates fission . Next , we investigated how vcp loss-of-function leads to elongated mitochondria . First , we examined the expression levels of Mfn in the female germline , using mosaic analysis , as above . We used a tagged genomic rescue transgene ( pCasper-Mfn-eGFP , a transgene construct with a GFP tagged Mfn under the control of its endogenous promoter , a kind gift from Dr . CK Yao ) to monitor the endogenous Mfn level as the existing anti-Mfn antibody lacked sufficient sensitivity . As expected , the genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP signal colocalizes with the mitochondria marker ATP5A in the nurse cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) . This signal is eliminated following Mfn RNAi , indicating that genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP is a reliable marker for endogenous Mfn ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B ) . In each egg chamber , vcp loss-of-function cells are adjacent to wildtype cells , providing an ideal opportunity to unambigously compare the levels of Mfn . As shown in Figure 1J–J’’ , nurse cells homozygous for a vcp loss-of-function mutant have greatly increased Mfn levels compared to wildtype and heterozygous vcp loss-of-function cells . The findings that endogenous VCP regulates Mfn in vivo are unexpected and important , as VCP is a highly abundant cytosolic protein with many targets and VCP does not show appreciable localization to mitochondria in unstressed cells . Second , we examined whether alteration of vcp can regulate Mfn levels in tissue lysate . Overexpression of wildtype VCP ( VCP OE ) in the flight muscle resulted in a decrease in endogenous Mfn levels ( Figure 2A ) . VCP overexpression also caused a decrease in the levels of Mfn when Mfn was overexpressed ( Mfn OE ) using the IFM promoter , suggesting that VCP regulates Mfn post transcriptionally ( Figure 2A ) . Conversely , VCP RNAi resulted in an increase in endogenous Mfn levels in a wildtype background , and an increase in total Mfn levels in the presence of Mfn OE ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , VCP overexpression does not alter the levels of pro-fission protein DRP1 ( Figure 2C ) . In addition , VCP’s regulation of Mfn is specific and not part of a general mitophagy response since the levels of other mitochondrial proteins , such as the outer membrane protein Porin , the inner membrane protein NDUSF3 , and the matrix protein MnSOD , are not altered ( Figure 2D ) . To explore the possibility that Mfn is a direct target for VCP , we asked if Mfn could physically interact with VCP in immunoprecipitation assays from S2 cells . Indeed , full length VCP strongly interacts with Mfn ( Figure 2E ) . This is consistent with previous findings ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . VCP has been shown to interact with substrate through the D1 ATPase domain , with the presence of the N domain being essential for the interaction ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . As shown in Figure 2E , this is also the case with the VCP-Mfn interaction . When the N domain of VCP is deleted , the strength of VCP-Mfn interaction is decreased , and it is undetectable when N and D1 are both deleted . In contrast , removal of the D2 domain has no effect on interaction between VCP and Mfn . Interestingly , Mfn levels in the input blot are decreased under conditions when VCP and Mfn interact , but not under conditions in which interactions are not observed , consistent with the hypothesis that direct interaction between VCP and Mfn is required for Mfn degradation . Together , these observations suggest that Mfn is a specific , direct target of VCP . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 007Figure 2 . Mfn is a specific target of VCP .

We and others have shown that PINK1 and Parkin function in the same pathway , with PINK1 positively regulating Parkin to control mitochondrial integrity and quality control in Drosophila ( Clark et al . , 2006; Yang et al . , 2006; Park et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , levels of Mfn are significantly increased in PINK1 and parkin null mutants and downregulation of Mfn protein levels suppresses phenotypes in both mutants ( Deng et al . , 2008; Yang et al . , 2008; Park et al . , 2009; Yu et al . , 2011 ) . The results presented above suggest that expression of VCP , by decreasing the level of Mfn , could also suppress PINK1/parkin phenotypes . Kim et al . have argued that VCP expression suppresses PINK1 , but not parkin loss-of-function phenotypes . This , along with their observation that VCP levels at mitochondria increased following expression of Parkin in the presence of CCCP , suggested a model in which VCP action on mitochondria requires recruitment by Parkin ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Because the EDTP-Gal4 driver used in these earlier experiments does not express at significant levels in flight muscle ( Seroude et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 3J , see GFP signals ) , we reexamined this issue . We expressed VCP in the flight muscle of PINK1 and parkin mutants . As previously shown ( Yang et al . , 2006; Clark et al . , 2006; Park et al . , 2006 ) , PINK1 and parkin null mutants show mitochondrial defects and tissue disintegration with vacuolation in muscle ( Figure 3A–B’’ and D–D’’ ) . At the ultrastructural level , PINK1 and parkin mutants display swollen mitochondria with a broken cristae ( Figure 3A’’’ , B’’’ and D’’’ ) . VCP OE completely suppressed tissue damage and mitochondrial defects ( Figure 3C–C’’’ and E–E’’’ ) . The thorax indentation phenotype in PINK1/parkin mutants is also completely suppressed by VCP overexpression under the control of the IFM-Gal4 driver , but not the EDTP-Gal4 driver ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The suppression observed by Kim , et al . is probably due to non-disjunction of the PINK1 null flies . As predicted for a mechanism of VCP action that occurs through regulation of Mfn , VCP OE significantly reduced the accumulation of Mfn normally observed in both mutants ( Figure 3F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 008Figure 3 .

( F ) VCP OE caused a decrease in Mfn accumulation in parkin and PINK1 mutants . Mfn protein levels in the parkin mutant increased to 2 . 12 ± 0 . 69 as compared with wildtype ( set as 1 ) . VCP OE caused a decrease in Mfn levels in the parkin mutant to 1 . 26 ± 0 . 34 as compared with parkin ( p=0 . 005 , independent t test , N = 3 . **p<0 . 01 ) . In PINK1 mutants , Mfn levels increased to 2 . 69 ± 0 . 11 as compared with wildtype , while VCP OE in PINK1 mutant caused Mfn levels to decrease ( 1 . 77 ± 0 . 29 as compared with PINK1 , p=0 . 023 , independent t test , N = 3 , *p<0 . 05 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 009 To further substantiate the finding that overexpression of VCP suppresses parkin null mutants , we also examined VCP’s ability to suppress mitochondrial phenotypes associated with loss of both parkin and mul1 . MUL1 ( MULAN/MAPL ) is a RING-containing E3 ligase that acts as a negative regulator of Mfn in both Drosophila and mammals ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . When overexpressed , it suppresses PINK1 and parkin null mutant phenotypes by degrading Mfn , while loss of mul1 leads to increased levels of Mfn . Thus , parkin mul1 double null mutants have strikingly more severe mitochondrial phenotypes than those observed in flies lacking parkin alone ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Remarkably , expression of VCP resulted in a dramatic rescue of mitochondrial morphology due to lack of both parkin and mul1 ( Figure 3G–I’ ) . Together , these results suggest that VCP-dependent suppression of PINK1 null , parkin null and parkin mul1 double phenotypes occurs through downregulaton of Mfn levels ( Figure 3K ) . Together , our observations argue that VCP regulates Mfn levels under non-stress conditions . They also show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require PINK1 or Parkin . However , these results do not exclude the possibility that Parkin activation further promotes VCP-dependent Mfn degradation under some situations . To explore the basis of myopathy induced by VCP disease mutants we sought to create a model of IBMPFD in Drosophila muscle , as 90% of the IBMPFD patients show muscle phenotypes . Since VCP disease mutations are autosomal dominant , we characterized the consequences of disease mutant overexpression . The pathologies observed in IBMPFD patient muscle , and in muscle from VCP disease mutant transgenic and mouse knock-in models , include muscle cell death , changes in mitochondrial morphology , damaged tissue integrity , TAR DNA-binding protein 43 ( TDP43 ) mislocalization to the cytosol , and formation of autophagic marker p62 and ubiquitin aggregates , signs of multisystem proteinopathy ( Ju et al . , 2009; Ritson et al . , 2010; Nalbandian et al . , 2012; Ritz et al . , 2011; Nalbandian et al . , 2015b; Weihl , 2011; Ahmed et al . , 2016 ) . Previous studies of VCP disease mutants in Drosophila muscle showed effects on tissue integrity and mitochondria cristae structure ( Chang et al . , 2011; Kim et al . , 2013 ) , but not other pathologies . We thus investigated the pathologies due to mutant VCP expression . We focused on expression of VCP R152H and A229E ( corresponding to Human VCP R155H and A232E , hereafter referred to as VCP RH and VCP AE ) , as they are the most frequent and the most severe mutations identified , respectively ( Figure 4A ) . Anti-VCP antibody blotting shows that VCP WT , VCP RH and VCP AE are expressed at comparable level in the fly's thorax ( Figure 4B ) . In wildtype flies , flies with IFM-Gal4 insertion , and flies with VCP WT expression , the muscle structure was healthy and intact 6 days after eclosion . No cell death was observed and mitochondria were densely packed and contained high levels of MitoGFP ( Figure 4C , D and D’ ) . Muscles also displayed a well-aligned myofibril structure ( Figure 4E and E’ ) . Together these observations indicate that increased expression of VCP is not overtly toxic . In contrast , muscle from flies expressing VCP RH or VCP AE under IFM-Gal4 control ( thereafter called VCP RH or VCP AE flies ) showed extensive cell death ( 97 ± 3 . 6% and 95 . 7 ± 5 . 1% muscle are TUNEL-positive ) , defective MitoGFP signals ( Figure 4D’’ and D’’’ ) , and severely disrupted muscle integrity ( Figure 4E’’ and E’’’ ) . In addition , while in wildtype and VCP WT flies TDP43 was found in IFM nuclear and sarcoplasmic compartments , IFMs from VCP RH and AE flies showed a decrease in the intensity of the nuclear signal , and an increase in the intensity of staining associated with puncta in the sarcoplasmic area ( Figure 4C , F–F’’’ ) . Muscle from VCP RH and AE flies also contained large aggregates of anti-p62 and anti-ubiquitin staining . These were not observed in wildtype or VCP WT flies ( Figure 4G–H’’’ ) . Importantly , the pathologies observed in flight muscle at day 6 post eclosion were not present at day 2 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , suggesting the degenerative nature of the pathology , as with the human disease and mouse models ( Kimonis et al . , 2008a; Custer et al . , 2010; Nalbandian et al . , 2012 ) . Together , these observations indicate that IFM-specific expression of VCP RH and AE recapitulates a broad spectrum of IBMPFD disease pathologies and forms the strong basis for further investigation of disease mechanisms and treatment studies . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 010Figure 4 .

In VCP RH and AE muscle , however , mitochondria are smaller in size , and more fragmented than in VCP WT flies . In addition , they also have severe ultrastructural defects under EM studies with a broken cristae ( Figure 5C–D’ ) . This phenotype is similar to that of flies with a muscle-specific Mfn knock down ( Figure 5E and E’ ) ( Deng et al . , 2008 ) . Muscle from 2-day-old VCP RH and VCP AE flies also show similar phenotypes to Mfn knock down ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 012Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 015 The strong mitochondrial phenotypes observed in VCP RH or VCP AE predicts that expression of VCP RH or VCP AE may result in a greater decrease in Mfn levels as compared with the expression of VCP WT . This is indeed what we observed ( Figure 5F ) . This raises the possibility that VCP RH and AE are hyperactive alleles . To further substantiate these findings , we compared the Mfn levels in flies expressing VCP E2Q , a well-established ATPase defective mutant containing two mutations ( fly or human residues by number E305Q and E578Q ) that abolish the ATPase activity of the D1 and D2 domains . Expression of E2Q did not significantly change the Mfn levels ( Figure 5F ) . As a control , the expression of any of the above forms of VCP did not alter expression levels of mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp60 ( Figure 5F ) . These results suggest that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive with respect to promoting downregulation of Mfn levels . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that VCP disease mutants should also rescue mitochondrial phenotypes in parkin and parkin mul1 double mutants . As shown in Figure 5G–J , expression of VCP RH and AE mutants , but not VCP E2Q or VCP RNAi , robustly restored mitochondrial structure , as indicated by MitoGFP fluorescence , in the parkin null mutant ( Figure 5K and L ) . Moreover , corresponding to the mitochondrial phenotypes , the accumulation of Mfn in parkin mutants was significantly reduced in the presence of VCP WT , RH and AE , with VCP RH and AE causing greater decreases in Mfn levels than VCP WT ( Figure 5S ) . In addition , VCP RH and AE expression also robustly rescued the mitochondrial defects in the parkin mul1 double null mutants , but an expression of VCP E2Q or VCP RNAi did not ( Figure 5M–R ) . Taken together , these results indicate that VCP RH and AE disease mutants do not behave as ATPase defective or loss-of-function mutants , and instead are hyperactive with respect to regulation of Mfn . A prediction from our finding that Mfn downregulation is important for IBMPFD pathology is that downregulation of Mfn should result in phenotypes similar to those observed with an expression of VCP disease mutants . Indeed , mfn muscle-specific knockdown flies have fragmented mitochondria ( Figure 4I–I’ ) , TDP43 mislocalization ( Figure 4J–J’ ) , vacuole formation ( Figure 4K–K’ ) , p62 and ubiquitin accumulation ( Figure 4L–L’ and M–M’ ) , as with the VCP disease mutants . Next we asked if mfn overexpression could rescue the phenotypes due to VCP RH and AE . Since mfn overexpression results in significant mitochondrial phenotypes , tissue disintegration and cell death on its own ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) , we are unable to address this question completely due to a technical limitation . We were , however , able to bring about a mild increase in Mfn levels through addition of 2 copies of an mfn genomic rescue transgene in the background of VCP RH and AE expressing flies . Interestingly , this resulted in a suppression of the mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae phenotypes in 2-day-old VCP RH and AE flies ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) but not the pathology observed in VCP RH and AE fly muscles at 6 days ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) . Together , our data suggest that downregulation of Mfn is an important contributor to IBMPFD muscle pathology . Next , we extended our studies in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . We focused our studies on VCPR155H/+ cells ( thereafter called RH cells ) , as fibroblasts harboring the VCPA232E/+ mutation are not available . First , we characterized mitochondrial respiration in control and immortalized patient fibroblasts . As shown in Figure 6A , the basal level Oxygen Consumption Rate ( OCR ) in the VCP RH patient cells is slightly decreased compared to the healthy control , suggesting that baseline mitochondrial respiratory chain function is compromised in patient cells . Maximum OCR , measured in the presence of the uncoupler FCCP , is significantly decreased in VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells . The spare OCR , which is calculated by subtracting the basal OCR from the maximum OCR , provides a measure of reserve mitochondrial capacity for ATP generation . The spare OCR in IBMPFD patient cells is significantly decreased as compared with controls . Others have recently reported similar observations ( Nalbandian et al . , 2015a ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 016Figure 6 . IBMPFD patient cells carrying the VCPR155H/+ mutation have decreased Mfn 1 and Mfn 2 levels and reduced mitochondrial fusion . ( A ) Oxygen consumption rates ( OCR ) in healthy control and IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . Inhibitory drugs were added at the time points indicated . Basal levels of OCR ( p=0 . 026 , independent t test , N = 8 ) and maximum ( CCCP-stimulated ) OCR ( p=3 . 74E-06 , independent t test , N = 8 ) are both decreased in the IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . The spare OCR is also significantly decreased ( p=0 . 000024 , independent t test , N = 8 ) . ( B ) Mfn 1 and 2 levels are consistently decreased in three independent lysates from the IBMPFD patient fibroblasts when compared to the healthy control . Mfn 1 levels in patient fibroblasts are reduced to 0 . 66 ± 0 . 14 of the controls ( p=0 . 001 , independent t test , N = 5 ) ; Mfn 2 levels are reduced to 0 . 60 ± 0 . 14 of the controls ( p=0 . 008 , independent t test , N = 5 ) . **p<0 . 01 .

After laser photoactivation of a region ( Red hollow square in C and D ) , cells were tracked for 30 min . ( E ) PA-GFP signal intensity ( throughout the whole cell ) is recorded every 3 minutes , and the rate of decrease of average GFP signal is a measure of mitochondrial fusion . Fusion rates are significantly decreased in the IBMPFD patient fibroblasts when compared to the healthy control ( C’ , D’ and E , independent t test , *p<0 . 05 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 016 Disruption of mitochondrial fusion can result in defects in respiration similar to those observed in patient cells ( Chen et al . , 2003b ) . Mfn 1 and 2 levels in VCP RH cells were reduced to 0 . 66 ± 0 . 14 and 0 . 60 ± 0 . 14 respectively , as compared with age and gender matched healthy control cells ( set as 1 , Figure 6B ) . To explore the functional significance of this decrease , we carried out mitochondrial fusion assays using fibroblasts from healthy controls and patients . Both cell populations were transfected with a plasmid encoding a mitochondrial matrix targeted , photoactivated GFP ( PA-GFP ) . Following photoactivation of GFP within a region of the cell , the GFP fluorescence signal spreads and the intensity decreases as these mitochondria fuse with non-activated neighboring mitochondria . Thus , in this assay an increased rate of fluorescence loss corresponds to increased mitochondrial fusion activity ( Mishra et al . , 2014a ) . In control cells , PA-GFP gradually decreases after photoactivation; in the VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells , the GFP signal decrease is significantly delayed ( Figure 6C–D’ , E ) . These data suggest that the VCP RH mutation results in a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels that lead to impaired mitochondrial fusion . In addition , the VCP mutant impairs both basal and maximal mitochondrial respiratory function . It has been controversial in the field whether VCP disease mutants with increased ATPase activity behave as dominant-active or dominant-negative mutants . Some studies show that VCP RH and AE , with enhanced ATPase activity ( Weihl et al . , 2006; Zhang et al . , 2015; Niwa et al . , 2012; Manno et al . , 2010; Tang and Xia , 2013 ) , result in hyperactivity in animal disease models ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) . However , other cell-based studies suggest they behave in a dominant negative fashion ( Ritz et al . , 2011; Ju et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2013; Bartolome et al . , 2013; Kimura et al . , 2013 ) . Understanding how VCP disease mutants behave is critical for understanding the disease process and finding possible therapies . We hypothesize that if an abnormally enhanced ATPase activity causes pathology , disease severity should ameliorate if ATPase activity is decreased through the use of VCP ATPase inhibitors . To test this hypothesis , we characterized the effects of VCP inhibitors in vivo . Multiple VCP ATPase activity inhibitors have recently been described ( Chapman et al . , 2015 ) . NMS-873 , 3-[3-Cyclopentylsulfanyl-5- ( 4'-methanesulfonyl-2-methyl-biphenyl-4-yloxymethyl ) -[1 , 2 , 4] triazol-4-yl]-pyridine , an allosteric inhibitor of VCP ATPase activity , is a highly specific and robust VCP ATPase inhibitor ( Magnaghi et al . , 2013 ) . ML240 , 2- ( 2-Amino-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl ) −8-methoxy-N- ( phenylmethyl ) −4-quinazolinamine is another potent inhibitor , which competitively blocks ATP binding to VCP ( Chou et al . , 2013 ) . These drugs and their derivatives were developed for treatment of cancers ( Magnaghi et al . , 2013; Chou et al . , 2013; Deshaies , 2014; Zhou et al . , 2015 ) . The ability of these compounds to rescue defects in IBMPFD models has not been reported . We first examined the effects of VCP inhibitors delivered to Drosophila through feeding . Various concentrations of drug or DMSO were included in food during the first to third larval instars , and muscle mitochondrial morphology was characterized at 2 and 6 days after eclosion . NMS-873 or ML240 feeding resulted in dramatic mitochondrial elongation in wildtype animals as visualized with MitoGFP using light microscopy ( Figure 7A–A’’ ) and at the ultrastructural level using EM ( Figure 7B–B’’’ ) . These phenotypes are similar to those observed following VCP RNAi ( Figure 1C–C’’ ) . In another respect , drug-treated animals developed normally ( data not shown ) . The smaller mitochondria phenotype associated with overexpression of VCP WT was also significantly suppressed following feeding with 30 µM NMS-873 or 30 µM ML240 ( Figure 7C–C’’’ ) . Feeding with NMS-873 and ML240 also reversed the phenotypic rescue of mitochondrial defects caused by expression of VCP WT , RH and AE in PINK1 mutants ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Supporting these results , feeding with NMS-873 also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of Mfn ( Figure 7D ) . Together , these observations suggest that NMS-873 and ML240 inhibit endogenous VCP in vivo , resulting in a phenocopy of loss of VCP function . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 017Figure 7 . VCP inhibitors promote mitochondrial elongation . ( A–A’’ ) MitoGFP assay for mitochondrial morphology . Compared to DMSO-fed flies , 10 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding results in more fused mitochondria in 2-day-old flies . Scale bar: 5 µm . ( B–B’’ and C–C’’ ) In 6-day-old flies fed with 30 µM NMS-873 ( B’ ) or 30 µM ML240 ( B’’ ) , elongated mitochondria ( outlined in dashed white lines ) are observed in muscle . Mitochondria are small in VCP WT flies ( C ) as compared with WT ( IFM-Gal4 control , B ) . This phenotype is reversed by 30 µM NMS-873 ( C’ ) or 30 µM ML240 ( C’’ ) feeding and shifted towards a pro-fusion direction , as the mitochondria are also elongated as compared with WT ( B ) . ( B’’’ and C’’’ ) Statistical analysis of mitochondrial size in EM cross sections . In wildtype flies , 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding results in a mitochondrial size increase to 6 . 46 ± 0 . 44 µm2 ( p=0 . 007 , independent t test , N = 45 ) or 5 . 75 ± 0 . 48 µm2 ( p=0 . 032 , independent t test , N = 39 ) as compared to the DMSO group ( 3 . 45 ± 0 . 27 µm2 , N = 47 ) . VCP WT expression results in small mitochondria ( 1 . 78 ± 0 . 05 µm2 , N = 68 ) as compared with WT ( B ) . Feeding of 30 µM NMS-873 ( 5 . 41 ± 0 . 40 µm2 , p=0 . 000 , independent t test , N = 44 ) or ML240 ( 4 . 90 ± 0 . 42 µm2 , p=0 . 000 , independent t test , N = 45 ) reverses these effects .

VCP inhibitor treatment blocks VCP WT and disease mutant rescue of mitochondrial defects in a PINK1 mutant . ( A–B’ ) MitoGFP assay shows that NMS-873 and ML240 feeding blocks the ability of VCP WT to rescue PINK1 mutant mitochondrial phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner . 2 . 5 µM NMS-873 ( A ) and 10 µM ML240 ( B ) partially inhibit the rescue effect . The rescue effect is significantly blocked with 10 µM NMS-873 ( A’ ) and 20 µM ML240 ( B’ ) . Scale bar: 20 µm .

Scale bar: 5 µm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 018 We then fed NMS-873 and ML240 to VCP RH and AE disease mutant flies and analyzed mitochondrial phenotypes , muscle viability and integrity in 6-day-old flies . Flies were fed with 30 µM NMS-873 or 30 µM ML240 from first instar larvae until 6 days after eclosion . In control and VCP WT expressing flies , NMS-873 and ML240 feeding resulted in normal development to adulthood ( data not shown ) and did not cause muscle death or tissue damage; all muscles were TUNEL negative and had an intact tissue structure ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) . Strikingly , NMS-873 and ML240 feeding largely prevented muscle cell death caused by expression of VCP RH or AE ( Figure 8A–B’’ ) . It also significantly rescued disrupted muscle integrity ( Figure 8C–D’’ ) . Rescue of mitochondrial size , cristae structure , and myofibril organization was also observed at the ultrastructural level ( Figure 8E–F’’ ) . It is interesting to note that in the VCP disease mutants feeding groups ( Figure 8E’ , E’’ , F’ and F’’ ) , mitochondria remained somewhat smaller as compared to wildtype in Figure 7B . Elongated mitochondria , such as those observed in the wildtype and VCP WT feeding groups ( Figure 7B’ , B’’ , C’ and C’’ ) , were never observed in the VCP RH and VCP AE groups even though all were fed the same concentration of inhibitors . This partial suppression further suggests that these mutants are hyperactive . Finally , we note that VCP inhibitor feeding also resulted in significant rescue of a number of other phenotypes in VCP RH and AE expressing flies , including those associated with p62 , ubiquitin and TDP43 ( Figure 8G–L’’ ) . Together , these observations suggest that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive in multiple aspects , and that disease phenotypes can be suppressed by inhibition of VCP ATPase activity . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 019Figure 8 . VCP inhibitors block mitochondrial defects , muscle tissue damage and muscle cell death in VCP disease mutant flies . ( A–B’’ ) Expression of VCP RH and AE leads to muscle cell death by 6 days after eclosion , as visualized through loss of MitoGFP and TUNEL positive signal in nuclei . In the DMSO feeding groups 3 . 4 ± 0 . 5% of VCP RH and 4 . 8 ± 0 . 6% of VCP AE flies are TUNEL negative . 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding since first instar larvae till 6 days after eclosion significantly blocks the muscle cell death , with 64 . 3 ± 17 . 0% ( p=0 . 017 ) and 85 . 1 ± 19 . 0% ( p=0 . 000 ) of VCP RH , and 80 . 9 ± 10 . 1% ( p=0 . 002 ) and 95 . 6 ± 3 . 1% ( p=0 . 000 ) of VCP AE muscles TUNEL negative . Data are shown as mean±½SD . Independent t test is used . Three independent rounds are performed , 15–20 flies are used each round . *p<0 . 05; **p<0 . 01 . Scale bar: 10 µm .

( G–L’’ ) In 6-day-old flies , 30 µM NMS-873 ( G’ , H’ , J’ and K’ ) or ML240 ( G’’ , H’’ , J’’ and K’’ ) treatments result in a significant decrease in Ref ( 2 ) P/p62 ( G and J ) and ubiquitin ( H and K ) aggregates in VCP RH and AE expressing flies; TDP43 mislocalization ( I and L ) is partially rescued as the large sarcoplasmic signal decreases , but no nuclear signal is observed ( I’ , I’’ , L’ and L’’ ) .

VCP inhibitor feeding does not affect muscle viability and tissue integrity in 6-day-old flies .

( C–D’’ ) Toluidine Blue assay shows that feeding of 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 does not disrupt muscle integrity in WT ( IFM-Gal4 control , C–C’’ ) and VCP WT flies ( D–D’’ ) . Scale bar: 40 µm . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 020 The above data demonstrated a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels , mitochondrial fusion defects and impaired mitochondrial respiratory function in IBMPFD patient cells . Next , we explored the effects of these drugs on these changes in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . In patient cells , a high concentration of ML240 ( 10 µM , with IC50 of 110 nM ) or NMS-873 ( 10 µM , with IC50 of 30 nM ) led to cell death , and NMS-873 directly inhibits mitochondrial respiration ( data not shown ) . However , when lower concentrations of ML240 are used , robust rescue effects are observed ( Figure 9 ) . As shown in Figure 9A , immortalized IBMPFD patient fibroblasts have decreased Mfn 1 levels , and these are increased by treatment with 250 nM ML240 for 6 hr . Overall mitochondrial morphology of IBMPFD fibroblasts does not change in response to inhibitor treatment ( Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ) . However , in a more sensitive assay in which rates of fusion are measured directly , mitochondrial fusion defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts were significantly rescued after 6 hr of treatment with 250 nM ML240 ( Figure 9B ) . Finally , 50 nM and 100 nM ML240 treatment for 4 days also significantly enhanced the basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) in patient fibroblasts ( Figure 9C ) . Similarly , 1 nM and 10 nM NMS-873 treatment for 6 days significantly enhanced the maximal oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) in patient fibroblasts as well ( Figure 9D ) . The fact that two inhibitors with different mechanisms generate similar results in terms of rescuing IBMFPD pathologies reduces the likelihood that these are off-targeting effects . Together , these data strongly support the effects of VCP inhibitors as potential therapeutic tools for IBMPFD disease . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 021Figure 9 . VCP inhibitor treatment significantly suppresses mitochondrial respiratory chain and fusion defects in VCPR155H/+ IBMPFD patient fibroblasts .

However , it is controversial whether these mutations cause disease through a dominant active or dominant negative manner . Moreover , the molecular mechanisms by which VCP mutations alter mitochondrial function are unclear . Here , we have investigated the endogenous function of VCP , cellular effects of expression of VCP disease mutants , and the ability of VCP inhibitors to suppress VCP disease pathology in Drosophila and patient fibroblasts . In summary , we have made the following findings: Endogenous VCP regulates mitochondrial fusion ( Figure 10A ) . Loss of VCP function leads to increased Mfn levels and increased mitochondrial size in multiple tissues . Conversely , VCP overexpression results in reduced Mfn levels and decreased mitochondrial size . VCP physically interacts with Mfn via domains that are also used to bind its substrates in other contexts . Thus , it is likely that Mfn is an endogenous VCP substrate . Here we provide the first in vivo evidence in muscle , the major disease tissue in IBMPFD , that Mfn is a specific endogenous target of VCP . Regulation of endogenous Mfn by VCP is unexpected , given that VCP is an abundant protein implicated in multiple cellular processes , but has not been shown to localize to mitochondria that are not depolarized by CCCP . We show that VCP-dependent removal of Mfn does not require Parkin or Mul1 , E3 ligases known to ubiquitinate Mfn . How VCP brings about Parkin and Mul1-independent removal of Mfn requires further investigation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 023Figure 10 . Proposed mechanisms of VCP disease mutants mediated mitochondrial defects and potential therapeutic role of VCP inhibitors . ( A ) Under physiological conditions , VCP , independent of PINK1/parkin and Mul1 , negatively regulates Mfn protein levels , which are critical for the proper balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission . ( B ) In the IBMPFD disease , the enhanced ATPase activity of a VCP disease mutant protein results in excessive loss of Mfn and mitochondrial fusion , leading to mitochondrial fusion defects . Besides the mitochondrial defects , VCP disease mutants also generate pathology including adult muscle tissue damage and muscle cell death . ( C ) VCP ATPase inhibitors robustly relieve the pathology caused by VCP disease mutants associated with hyperactive VCP activity while leaving normal VCP-dependent functions intact . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17834 . 023 IBMPFD is 100% penetrant , and myopathy is the most prevalent ( affecting 90% of patients ) and primary symptom of IBMPFD patients . We generated an IBMPFD disease model in adult Drosophila muscle , and used this system to monitor tissue pathology , and investigate the molecular mechanisms by which VCP disease mutants function . We show that compared to VCP WT , expression of VCP disease mutants results in tissue damage , mitochondrial fusion defects and decreased levels of Mfn ( Figure 10B ) . These phenotypes are opposite to those associated with decreased levels of VCP , or expression of an ATPase defective mutant version of VCP . Expression of VCP disease mutants , but not a VCP ATPase defective mutant or VCP RNAi , also suppresses the mitochondrial defects mediated by accumulation of Mfn in PINK1 null , parkin null , and parkin mul1 double null mutants . Taken together , these results suggest that VCP disease mutants do not function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants , but rather as dominant activated mutants in regulating Mfn levels and bringing about mitochondrial fusion defects . This conclusion is further supported by our findings that mitochondrial fusion and Mfn levels are also decreased in VCP disease mutant fibroblasts . Our finding that VCP overexpression suppresses a parkin null mutant in addition to a PINK1 null stands in contrast to what was reported in Kim et al . , who proposed that VCP-dependent degradation of Mfn required recruitment by Parkin . In addition , we also find that VCP overexpression suppresses phenotypes due to double mutants of parkin and mul1 , which acts in a parallel pathway to degrade Mfn ( Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Together , these observations show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require PINK1 or parkin . The VCP-dependent degradation of Mfn we observe is also specific and unlikely to be mediated through a more general process such as mitophagy , as levels of several other mitochondrial proteins are not altered by VCP overexpression . However , these results do not exclude models in which Parkin activation further promotes VCP-dependent Mfn degradation , which may or may not involve mitophagy , under some conditions . Regarding the mechanisms of VCP disease mutant action , in vitro biochemistry studies suggest that they have increased ATPase activities , thus favoring a dominant active model ( Weihl et al . , 2006; Zhang et al . , 2015; Niwa et al . , 2012; Manno et al . , 2010; Tang and Xia , 2013 ) . In addition , in vivo data from Drosophila shows that eye phenotypes caused by VCP disease mutant expression can be alleviated through loss of one copy of wildtype VCP . This also is consistent with models in which VCP mutants have increased activity ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , in cell culture studies Bartolome , et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression led to mitochondria respiratory chain defects , as did VCP RNAi ( Bartolome et al . , 2013 ) ; Ritz , et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression impaired endocytosis to the same extent as that of VCP ATPase defective mutants ( Ritz et al . , 2011 ) . While the above studies can be interpreted as showing that VCP disease mutants function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants , these results do not rule out the possibility that disease mutants are hyperactive alleles . For example , an alternative interpretation of the impairment of respiratory chain function observed following VCP disease mutant expression or following VCP RNAi is that either an increase or a decrease in the levels of VCP activity leads to mitochondrial defects , which is what we observed in this study . Currently there is no treatment that can halt the progression of IBMPFD . Our findings that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive provide important therapeutic implications . Indeed , we find VCP inhibitors potently rescue multiple VCP disease phenotypes in flies and patient cells ( Figure 10C ) . Importantly , suppression includes phenotypes beyond mitochondria ( Figure 10C ) , involving TDP43 , p62 and ubiquitin , suggesting that these inhibitors are likely to be effective in therapeutic settings . Of course , in order for VCP inhibitors to be useful as therapeutics , it will be necessary to inhibit mutant forms of VCP to an extent sufficient to suppress disease without bringing about a deleterious decrease in the activity of wildtype VCP . Our observation that Drosophila fed inhibitors are suppressed with respect to VCP disease phenotypes , but otherwise develop normally , suggests that this therapeutic goal may be possible . Finally , VCP disease mutants are associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Abramzon et al . , 2012 ) , and hereditary spastic paraplegia ( de Bot et al . , 2012 ) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease ( Gonzalez et al . , 2014 ) . Our findings suggest possible therapeutic values of VCP inhibitors for these diseases .\nFull length VCP ( 1-802aa ) , and truncated VCP cDNAs ∆N-VCP ( 186–802 aa ) , ∆N + D1-VCP ( 456–802 aa ) and ∆D2-VCP ( 1–477 aa ) were amplified from VCP cDNA derived from pUASt-VCP WT , a gift from Dr .

Human primary fibroblasts from IBMPFD ( GM21752 ) and age-matched control ( GM00024 ) were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research ( https://catalog . coriell . org ) and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM , Gibco ) or Minimum Essential Media ( MEM , Gibco ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , and penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C and 5% CO2 . Primary fibroblasts were immortalized by infection with retrovirus expressing hTERT ( Addgene plasmid #1771 ) . Infected cells were selected in puromycin ( 1 . 5 ug/mL ) for 1 week and maintained in 1 ug/ml puromycin . S2 cells , fly thoraxes or fibroblasts were lysed in RIPA Buffer with Protease Inhibitors ( Roche ) and 200 mM PMSF ( Sigma ) . Protein lysates were centrifuged at 16 , 000g for 15 mins , and the supernatants boiled with 6XSDS sample Buffer ( Bioland ) at 95°C for 5 mins . Proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE Gels . Gels were transferred to PVDF membrane ( Millipore ) and incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight . Following several washes , blots were then incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature and then washed extensively . Primary antibodies used include: Anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody ( Millipore , 1:1000 ) , Anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody ( Millipore , 1:3000 ) , Anti-Flag rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Genscript , 1:2000 ) , Anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Invitrogen , 1:3000 ) , Anti-Actin rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Sigma , 1:2000 ) , Anti-Tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody ( Sigma , 1:4000 ) , Anti-Porin mouse monoclonal antibody ( Abcam , 1:2000 ) , Anti-VCP rabbit monoclonal antibody ( Cell Signalling Technology , 1:2000 ) , Anti-Human Mfn 1 and 2 mouse monoclonal antibody ( Abcam , 1:2000 ) , Anti-MnSOD rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Abcam , 1:2000 ) and Anti-NDUSF3 mouse monoclonal antibody ( Abcam , 1:2000 ) . Anti-Drosophila Mfn Rabbit polyclonal antibody ( 1:3000 ) was a gift from Dr . Alexander Whitworth ( Ziviani et al . , 2010 ) . Donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit HRP conjugated secondary antibodies ( GE Healthcare , 1:10000 or 20000 ) were used . 48 hr after transfection , S2 cells were harvested and lysed in the RIPA Buffer with protease inhibitors . Protein lysates were incubated with Dynabeads G and primary antibody ( Anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody , Millipore 1:300 ) at 4°C overnight and washed in 0 . 1%Tween/PBS four times and eluted in 2XSDS sample buffer ( BioRad ) and denatured at 95°C . The samples are assayed by western blot . Powdered forms of NMS-873 ( Selleckchem ) and ML240 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) were dissolved in DMSO as stocks . Stock solution and DMSO as the vehicle control were diluted in ethanol/ddH2O and mixed with Drosophila food . Food dye was added to ensure thorough mix . Parents of desired genotypes were put in DMSO or inhibitors containing food for 3 days and removed . Thus , all growth following egg laying occurred in the presence of inhibitors . Immediately after eclosion , the progeny were transferred to newly prepared food vials containing the same concentration of DMSO or inhibitors . The progeny was assayed at the time points stated in the text . For human fibroblast treatment , stock solution of ML240 , NMS-873 and DMSO vehicle control were diluted to the desired concentration and added to the culture media . Media were changed each day if the treatment was longer than 24 hr . The mitochondrial fusion assay was performed using photoactivatable mitoGFP ( PA-GFP ) localized to the mitochondrial matrix as previously described ( Mishra et al . , 2014b; Karbowski et al . , 2004 ) . Briefly , immortalized fibroblasts were infected with retroviruses expressing matrix-treated DsRed and matrix-targeted PA-GFP to create stable cell lines . Cells were plated on glass coverslips ( LabTek ) and imaged live at 37°C on an LSM 710 confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Inc . ) . PA-GFP is activated in a region of interest ( 5 µm x 5 µm ) by illumination with a 405 nm laser . The activated signal is collected in z-stacks every 3 min over the next 30 min . Fusion events result in the dilution of the activated signal , and the average pixel intensity ( for the entire cell ) over time is a measurement of fusion rates ( Karbowski et al . , 2004 ) . P-values are calculated using a Student’s t-test on the slopes of intensity versus time for individual measurements ( >20 per genotype ) . Oxygen consumption rates ( OCR ) were measured in immortalized fibroblasts using a Seahorse Biosciences Extracellular Flux Analyzer ( Model XF96 ) . Briefly , 10 , 0000 cells/well were plated the day before measurement into a 96 well culture plate . On the day of measurement , the media was exchanged for non-bicarbonate-containing DMEM ( Sigma-Aldrich Cat . #D5030 ) media using the Seahorse PrepStation , and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hr at 37°C in room air prior to initiating measurements . Oxygen levels were measured over 5 min periods . Oxygen consumption rate was measured under basal and stress conditions as indicated . Oligomycin inhibits complex V and blocks ATP production dependent on respiration . CCCP uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production . It maximizes respiration without ATP synthesis . Antimycin A inhibits Complex III and thus blocks proton pumping and membrane potential formation . Drugs were injected automatically as indicated in the figure legends ( Oligomycin 5 µM , CCCP 10 µM , Antimycin A 1 µM ) . For drug pre-treatment studies ( Figure 9C–D ) , 5000 cells/well were plated into 96 well culture plates and pre-treated with ML240 for 4 days and NMS-873 for 6 days prior to OCR measurement . OCR values were normalized from total cellular content via sulforhodamine B measurements . The overall study design was a series of controlled laboratory experiments in Drosophila and human fibroblasts , as described in detail in the Figure legends sections . In all experiments , animals were randomly assigned to various experimental groups . The experiments were replicated at least three times ( N was noted in each experiment ) and the final analysis was presented . For in vivo experiments , 10–20 flies per group were used for each experiment . For the human fibroblasts experiments , details are described in the above methods sections . The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS ) 16 . 0 . The P values were assessed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test with P values considered significant as follows: *p<0 . 05 and **p<0 . 01 . For seahorse assay in human fibroblasts , Welch’s unpaired t test was used .",
         "A disease called “inclusion body myopathy , Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia ( IBMPFD ) ” is an inherited disorder that can affect the muscles , brain and bones . People affected by the disease find that their muscles become progressively weaker , and may go on to develop a bone disorder and a form of dementia . The disease is caused by mutations in a gene that codes for Valosin-Containing Protein ( VCP ) – a protein that carries out many different roles in cells . Mutated forms of VCP predominantly affect tissues and organs that need a lot of energy , such as the muscles and the brain . Within cells , structures called mitochondria generate energy . A number of studies suggest that the mitochondria in cells taken from individuals with IBMPFD do not generate energy properly . However , it is not known how mutant VCP disrupts mitochondria or how this leads to disease . Fruit flies and humans have similar versions of the gene that produces VCP . Studying flies that have mutations that affect the gene can therefore help researchers to understand how these mutations might affect humans . Zhang et al . have now engineered fruit flies whose muscle cells made a mutant form of VCP . These flies showed many of the symptoms of IBMPFD ( such as the death of muscle cells ) . In addition , the mitochondria in the muscle cells were smaller and more fragmented than normal . This led Zhang et al . to look at a protein called Mitofusin that controls how mitochondria fuse . VCP normally degrades Mitofusin; the mutant form of VCP caused Mitofusin to degrade excessively . This resulted in mitochondria experiencing reduced levels of fusion , leading to cell malfunction and death . In further experiments , Zhang et al . treated the disease-modeled flies and cells from human patients with IBMPFD with inhibitor drugs that prevent the activity of VCP . This treatment reversed the defects that affected the mitochondria and prevented the death of muscle cells . This opens up the possibility of using VCP inhibitors – which are already being investigated in clinical trials as a treatment for cancer – as drugs to treat IBMPFD .",

         "Missense mutations of valosin-containing protein  cause an autosomal dominant disease known as inclusion body myopathy , Paget disease with frontotemporal dementia  and other neurodegenerative disorders . The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment . Because 90% of IBMPFD patients have myopathy , we generated an in vivo IBMPFD model in adult Drosophila muscle , which recapitulates disease pathologies . We show that common VCP disease mutants act as hyperactive alleles with respect to regulation of Mitofusin . Importantly , VCP inhibitors suppress mitochondrial defects , muscle tissue damage and cell death associated with IBMPFD models in Drosophila . These results suggest that VCP disease mutants cause IBMPFD through a gain-of-function mechanism , and that VCP inhibitors have therapeutic value . IBMPFD is an autosomal dominant disease that afflicts multiple body systems  . One-third of the patients will also develop frontotemporal dementia  . VCP mutations are also associated with 1–2% of cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  , familial hereditary spastic paraplegia  and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2  disease  . Human p97/VCP and its Drosophila homologue have 85% identity and 93% similarity in protein sequence . VCP hexameric rings utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to promote protein and RNA homeostasis , often by directly or indirectly modifying the fate of ubiquitin-labeled proteins  . VCP interacts with a number of co-factors to regulate these processes  , making it challenging to identify the molecular basis of phenotypes associated with disease mutations . In vitro assays show that disease mutants have enhanced ATPase activity  . However , because VCP assembles as a hexamer , it is controversial whether disease mutants with increased ATPase activity cause disease through a dominant-active  or dominant-negative mechanism  . VCP disease mutants predominantly affect organs that have a high level of energy expenditure , such as brain and muscle . Mitochondria provide the bulk of the ATP to these tissues through oxidative phosphorylation , and mitochondrial functional defects , including mitochondrial uncoupling and decreased ATP production , are observed in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts  . Abnormal mitochondria are also observed in transgenic VCP disease mutant R155H mice as well as VCP R155H knock-in mice  . These observations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is important for the pathogenesis of IBMPFD , but the mechanism by which VCP mutation alters mitochondrial function is not clear . Recent studies have uncovered the roles of mitochondria fusion and fission defects in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative disorders  , particularly Parkinson's disease , the second most common neurodegenerative disorder  . In mammals , homologous proteins Mitofusin 1 and 2  mediate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion , with loss of function of Mfn 1 and 2 resulting in fragmented mitochondria and multiple defects in mitochondrial function  . In Hela cells , VCP promotes Mfn 1 degradation  . VCP also mediates Mfn 1 and 2 degradation when mitophagy is stimulated in mammalian cells , and overexpression of VCP in Drosophila leads to downregulation of a tagged Mfn-transgene  . These observations led us to investigate the mitochondrial basis and molecular mechanisms for VCP disease mutants function using both Drosophila and IBMPFD patient cell models . As IBMPFD show the highest penetrance in muscle , with 90% of patients manifesting phenotypes in this tissue , we generated Drosophila models of IBMPFD in muscle , which recapitulate disease pathologies . Consistent with the hypothesis that VCP disease phenotypes are due to increased activity on substrates , we find that VCP ATPase activity inhibitors such as NMS-873 and ML240 can significantly rescue mitochondrial defects , disrupted muscle integrity and muscle cell death in vivo in Drosophila , and mitochondrial fusion and respiration defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . Since VCP disease mutants have dramatic muscle phenotypes in humans and mouse models , and these are associated with defects in mitochondrial structure and function , we first examined the consequences of manipulating VCP levels . It also shows strong and consistent phenotypes in response to altered expression of genes required for mitochondrial fusion , fission and quality control  . Using the UAS-Gal4 system  , we expressed VCP under the control of an IFM promoter derived from the flightin gene we previously generated  . While expression of VCP under the control of the pan-muscle Gal4 drivers 24B-Gal4 or Mef2-Gal4 resulted in 100% adult lethality , expression of wildtype VCP under IFM control , which provides a pulse of expression in late pupal stages and early adulthood , gave rise to viable flies with intact and healthy muscle following adult eclosion . We utilized mitochondrially targeted GFP  as a mitochondrial marker , as well as transmission electron microscopy  at the ultrastructual levels for enhanced resolution particularly for cristae morphology . In 2-day-old flies , expression of VCP results in muscle with small mitochondria with intact cristae  . Similar phenotypes are also observed in muscle from 6-day-old VCP-expressing flies  . Conversely , expression of UAS-VCP RNAi under IFM control  results in mitochondria with an elongated phenotype  . Two independent VCP RNAi lines were utilized and both showed significant knockdown  . Endogenous VCP regulates mitochondrial fusion via negative regulation of Mfn protein levels . Electronic microscopic  images show that VCP OE  results in smaller mitochondria as compared with WT  .

A stage 10A egg chamber has three types of cells . Heat shock induction of mitotic recombination during larvae stages results in the creation of a mosaic pattern in the adult nurse cells . NLS  is used as a clone marker . Wildtype  cells are labeled with two copies of RFP , +/+; heterozygous mutant cells have one copy of RFP and one copy of vcp loss-of-function mutant , vcpK15502/+; homozygous mutant cells are RFP negative and have two copies of vcp loss-of-function mutant , vcpK15502/vcpK15502 . : A stage 10A egg chamber with a mosaic pattern of nurse cells . Scale bar: 20 µm . Anti-ATP5A antibody staining is used to visualize mitochondrial morphology in nurse cells .

A stage 10B egg chamber with a mosaic pattern of nurse cells . Higher magnification of the egg chamber in J  . Wildtype cells are RFP positive and homozygous vcp loss-of-function mutant cells are RFP negative  . pCasper-Mfn-eGFP levels significantly increase in homozygous vcp loss-of-function mutant cells  . Scale bar: 10 µm . VCP overexpression leads to smaller mitochondria , while VCP RNAi leads to elongated mitochondria in 2-day-old indirect flight muscles . EM shows that compared to WT  , VCP WT has smaller mitochondria with intact cristae  . VCP RNAi results in mitochondrial elongation  in 2-day-old flies . DOI: http://dx . Expression of VCP RNAi line 1 and RNAi line 2 result in a decrease in VCP levels to 45 . 12%  of those present in WT . Independent t test is used for statistical analysis , N = 3 . Normalized VCP levels are shown as mean±½SD . One nurse cell of a stage 10B egg chamber in transgenetic flies carrying the genomic rescue of Mfn  . S2 cells were transfected with pCasper-Mfn-eGFP and blotted and probed with anti-GFP antibody . Mfn dsRNA treatment results in loss of Mfn-eGFP expression . DOI: http://dx . 006 To explore the generality of VCP’s ability to regulate mitochondrial morphology we also examined mitochondrial morphology phenotypes of a vcp loss-of-function mutation . The indirect flight muscle is a cellular syncytium and therefore cannot be used for mosaic analysis . As an alternative , we focused on the Drosophila female germline , in which a vcp loss-of-function mutant can be monitored in individual nurse cells , which are relatively large and offer great resolution for examining mitochondrial morphology . vcpK15502 is a strong loss-of-function allele that has a P element insertion at the 5’-UTR of Drosophila VCP gene  and has been used to generate vcp loss-of-function clones in imaginal discs  . Each egg chamber develops from stage 1 to stage 14 and has three types of cells: follicle cells , nurse cells and the oocyte  . The germline complement of each egg chamber  derives from four sequential divisions of a single daughter of a stem cell . We utilized the FLP/FRT system  to create mitotic recombinants in which nurse cells were either wildtype  , heterozygous  or homozygous  for the vcp loss-of-function mutation  . NLS  respectively , whereas the homozygous vcp mutant cells are RFP negative  . Anti-ATP5A antibody is used to visualize mitochondrial morphology in nurse cells  . Mitochondria in wildtype and heterozygous vcp mutant cells have a punctate morphology  . Next , we investigated how vcp loss-of-function leads to elongated mitochondria . First , we examined the expression levels of Mfn in the female germline , using mosaic analysis , as above . We used a tagged genomic rescue transgene  to monitor the endogenous Mfn level as the existing anti-Mfn antibody lacked sufficient sensitivity . This signal is eliminated following Mfn RNAi , indicating that genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP is a reliable marker for endogenous Mfn  . In each egg chamber , vcp loss-of-function cells are adjacent to wildtype cells , providing an ideal opportunity to unambigously compare the levels of Mfn . As shown in Figure 1J–J’’ , nurse cells homozygous for a vcp loss-of-function mutant have greatly increased Mfn levels compared to wildtype and heterozygous vcp loss-of-function cells . The findings that endogenous VCP regulates Mfn in vivo are unexpected and important , as VCP is a highly abundant cytosolic protein with many targets and VCP does not show appreciable localization to mitochondria in unstressed cells . Second , we examined whether alteration of vcp can regulate Mfn levels in tissue lysate . VCP overexpression also caused a decrease in the levels of Mfn when Mfn was overexpressed  using the IFM promoter , suggesting that VCP regulates Mfn post transcriptionally  . Conversely , VCP RNAi resulted in an increase in endogenous Mfn levels in a wildtype background , and an increase in total Mfn levels in the presence of Mfn OE  . In addition , VCP’s regulation of Mfn is specific and not part of a general mitophagy response since the levels of other mitochondrial proteins , such as the outer membrane protein Porin , the inner membrane protein NDUSF3 , and the matrix protein MnSOD , are not altered  . To explore the possibility that Mfn is a direct target for VCP , we asked if Mfn could physically interact with VCP in immunoprecipitation assays from S2 cells . As shown in Figure 2E , this is also the case with the VCP-Mfn interaction . Interestingly , Mfn levels in the input blot are decreased under conditions when VCP and Mfn interact , but not under conditions in which interactions are not observed , consistent with the hypothesis that direct interaction between VCP and Mfn is required for Mfn degradation . Together , these observations suggest that Mfn is a specific , direct target of VCP . Hsp60 was used as a mitochondria control; Actin was used as a loading control . Mfn levels are normalized with Hsp60 and are displayed as mean±½SD . VCP OE also does not result in changes in the levels of the pro-fission protein DRP1 level  . DRP1 was detected using an HA tagged genomic rescue transgene expressed under the control of the endogenous DRP1 promoter  . Schematic diagram of full length and truncated VCP forms used in protein interaction assays in S2 cells . We and others have shown that PINK1 and Parkin function in the same pathway , with PINK1 positively regulating Parkin to control mitochondrial integrity and quality control in Drosophila  . Importantly , levels of Mfn are significantly increased in PINK1 and parkin null mutants and downregulation of Mfn protein levels suppresses phenotypes in both mutants  . The results presented above suggest that expression of VCP , by decreasing the level of Mfn , could also suppress PINK1/parkin phenotypes . have argued that VCP expression suppresses PINK1 , but not parkin loss-of-function phenotypes . This , along with their observation that VCP levels at mitochondria increased following expression of Parkin in the presence of CCCP , suggested a model in which VCP action on mitochondria requires recruitment by Parkin  . Because the EDTP-Gal4 driver used in these earlier experiments does not express at significant levels in flight muscle   , we reexamined this issue . As previously shown  , PINK1 and parkin null mutants show mitochondrial defects and tissue disintegration with vacuolation in muscle  . At the ultrastructural level , PINK1 and parkin mutants display swollen mitochondria with a broken cristae  . As predicted for a mechanism of VCP action that occurs through regulation of Mfn , VCP OE significantly reduced the accumulation of Mfn normally observed in both mutants  . Compared to wildtype  , parkin and PINK1 mutants lose MitoGFP signal and accumulate large aggregates . VCP OE  completely rescued the mitochondrial defects in both mutants  . Scale bar: 1 µm . VCP OE caused a decrease in Mfn accumulation in parkin and PINK1 mutants . Mfn protein levels in the parkin mutant increased to 2 . Normalized Mfn levels are shown as mean±½SD . Compared to wildtype , the parkin mul1 mutant lacks the most MitoGFP signal and large aggregates are present  . Lower Magnification , Scale bar: 20 µm;  Higher Magnification , Scale bar: 5 µm . EDTP-Gal4 driven UAS-MitoGFP signal is barely detected in the thorax , where the indirect flight muscle is located , suggesting that EDTP-Gal4 does not have sufficient flight muscle specific expression . MitoGFP is present at high levels in the thoraxes of IFM-Gal4 driven flies . Thorax structure is outlined with dashed white lines in white light and indicated with a white arrowhead in GFP field . Schematic diagram showing that PINK/Parkin in parallel with Mul1 negatively regulates Mfn protein levels; VCP negatively regulates Mfn protein levels independent of these modifiers . DOI: http://dx . IFM-Gal4 driven UAS-VCP expression but not EDTP-Gal4 driven UAS-VCP rescues thorax defects in PINK1 and parkin mutants in Drosophila . 009 To further substantiate the finding that overexpression of VCP suppresses parkin null mutants , we also examined VCP’s ability to suppress mitochondrial phenotypes associated with loss of both parkin and mul1 . When overexpressed , it suppresses PINK1 and parkin null mutant phenotypes by degrading Mfn , while loss of mul1 leads to increased levels of Mfn . Remarkably , expression of VCP resulted in a dramatic rescue of mitochondrial morphology due to lack of both parkin and mul1  . Together , these results suggest that VCP-dependent suppression of PINK1 null , parkin null and parkin mul1 double phenotypes occurs through downregulaton of Mfn levels  . Together , our observations argue that VCP regulates Mfn levels under non-stress conditions . They also show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require PINK1 or Parkin . To explore the basis of myopathy induced by VCP disease mutants we sought to create a model of IBMPFD in Drosophila muscle , as 90% of the IBMPFD patients show muscle phenotypes . The pathologies observed in IBMPFD patient muscle , and in muscle from VCP disease mutant transgenic and mouse knock-in models , include muscle cell death , changes in mitochondrial morphology , damaged tissue integrity , TAR DNA-binding protein 43  mislocalization to the cytosol , and formation of autophagic marker p62 and ubiquitin aggregates , signs of multisystem proteinopathy  . Previous studies of VCP disease mutants in Drosophila muscle showed effects on tissue integrity and mitochondria cristae structure  , but not other pathologies . No cell death was observed and mitochondria were densely packed and contained high levels of MitoGFP  . Together these observations indicate that increased expression of VCP is not overtly toxic . In contrast , muscle from flies expressing VCP RH or VCP AE under IFM-Gal4 control  showed extensive cell death  , defective MitoGFP signals  , and severely disrupted muscle integrity  . In addition , while in wildtype and VCP WT flies TDP43 was found in IFM nuclear and sarcoplasmic compartments , IFMs from VCP RH and AE flies showed a decrease in the intensity of the nuclear signal , and an increase in the intensity of staining associated with puncta in the sarcoplasmic area  . These were not observed in wildtype or VCP WT flies  . Importantly , the pathologies observed in flight muscle at day 6 post eclosion were not present at day 2  , suggesting the degenerative nature of the pathology , as with the human disease and mouse models  . Together , these observations indicate that IFM-specific expression of VCP RH and AE recapitulates a broad spectrum of IBMPFD disease pathologies and forms the strong basis for further investigation of disease mechanisms and treatment studies . Expression of VCP disease mutants and mfn RNAi knocking down lead to pathology in adult muscle tissue . Diagram of Human p97/VCP protein domains and two disease mutants , VCP R155H and A232E . Expression levels of UAS-VCP WT , RH and AE disease mutants expressed under IFM-Gal4 are comparable . 6-day-old VCP RH and AE expressing flies show high levels of TUNEL staining .

Toluidine Blue staining of overall muscle morphology shows that VCP RH and AE expression does not result in tissue damage . Cell death , as visualized using TUNEL/MitoGFP assay , is absent  and MitoGFP localization  is normal in VCP RH and AE . DOI: http://dx . 011 Next , we investigated the cellular basis of mitochondrial defects in our IBMPFD flies using electron microscopy . 6 days after eclosion , flies expressing VCP WT have smaller mitochondria as compared with control flies , but with intact cristae  . In VCP RH and AE muscle , however , mitochondria are smaller in size , and more fragmented than in VCP WT flies . In addition , they also have severe ultrastructural defects under EM studies with a broken cristae  . Electronic microscopic images of muscle of different genotypes . Compared to WT  , mitochondria are smaller with intact cristea in VCP WT  6 days after eclosion . 21 as compared with Gal4 control , which is set as 1  . 16  as compared with Gal4 control . Expression of VCP ATPase defective mutant E2Q  does not significantly change the Mfn level in fly thoraxes as compared with Gal4 control . Normalized Mfn levels are shown as mean±½SD . MitoGFP localization assay shows expression of VCP WT  , RH  and AE  potently rescues the mitochondrial defects in parkin mutant  . Western blot shows that increased Mfn levels normally present in a parkin null mutant are significantly decreased in VCP WT , RH and AE flies , but not in VCP E2Q flies . Normalized Mfn levels are shown as mean±½SD . DOI: http://dx . 2 days after eclosion , EM shows that compared to WT  , VCP WT expression results in smaller mitochondrial with intact cristae  . VCP RH and AE also have smaller and fragmented mitochondria , but the cristae are abnormal  , similar to the phenotype of mfn RNAi flies  . 2 copies of genomic rescue Mfn-HA  lead to a heterogeneous mitochondrial phenotype in which some mitochondria are elongated . In 2-day-old flies , expression of 2 copies pCasper-Mfn-HA  results in suppression of mitochondrial defects  in VCP RH  and AE  flies . 015Figure 5—figure supplement 3 . Mfn expression does not significantly rescue the pathology in VCP RH and AE fly muscles . 2 copies of the pCasper-Mfn-HA/eGFP transgene in VCP RH and AE flies at 6 days of age does not significantly alter muscle cell death assayed by TUNEL/MitoGFP  , overall tissue disintegration  , TDP43 mislocalization  , or the frequency of p62  and ubiquitin positive aggregates  . org/10 . 015 The strong mitochondrial phenotypes observed in VCP RH or VCP AE predicts that expression of VCP RH or VCP AE may result in a greater decrease in Mfn levels as compared with the expression of VCP WT . To further substantiate these findings , we compared the Mfn levels in flies expressing VCP E2Q , a well-established ATPase defective mutant containing two mutations  that abolish the ATPase activity of the D1 and D2 domains . As a control , the expression of any of the above forms of VCP did not alter expression levels of mitochondrial matrix protein Hsp60  . These results suggest that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive with respect to promoting downregulation of Mfn levels . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that VCP disease mutants should also rescue mitochondrial phenotypes in parkin and parkin mul1 double mutants . As shown in Figure 5G–J , expression of VCP RH and AE mutants , but not VCP E2Q or VCP RNAi , robustly restored mitochondrial structure , as indicated by MitoGFP fluorescence , in the parkin null mutant  . In addition , VCP RH and AE expression also robustly rescued the mitochondrial defects in the parkin mul1 double null mutants , but an expression of VCP E2Q or VCP RNAi did not  . Taken together , these results indicate that VCP RH and AE disease mutants do not behave as ATPase defective or loss-of-function mutants , and instead are hyperactive with respect to regulation of Mfn . A prediction from our finding that Mfn downregulation is important for IBMPFD pathology is that downregulation of Mfn should result in phenotypes similar to those observed with an expression of VCP disease mutants . Next we asked if mfn overexpression could rescue the phenotypes due to VCP RH and AE . Since mfn overexpression results in significant mitochondrial phenotypes , tissue disintegration and cell death on its own  , we are unable to address this question completely due to a technical limitation . We were , however , able to bring about a mild increase in Mfn levels through addition of 2 copies of an mfn genomic rescue transgene in the background of VCP RH and AE expressing flies . Interestingly , this resulted in a suppression of the mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae phenotypes in 2-day-old VCP RH and AE flies  but not the pathology observed in VCP RH and AE fly muscles at 6 days  . Together , our data suggest that downregulation of Mfn is an important contributor to IBMPFD muscle pathology . Next , we extended our studies in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . We focused our studies on VCPR155H/+ cells  , as fibroblasts harboring the VCPA232E/+ mutation are not available . As shown in Figure 6A , the basal level Oxygen Consumption Rate  in the VCP RH patient cells is slightly decreased compared to the healthy control , suggesting that baseline mitochondrial respiratory chain function is compromised in patient cells . Maximum OCR , measured in the presence of the uncoupler FCCP , is significantly decreased in VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells . The spare OCR in IBMPFD patient cells is significantly decreased as compared with controls . Oxygen consumption rates  in healthy control and IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . Basal levels of OCR  and maximum  OCR  are both decreased in the IBMPFD patient fibroblasts . Mfn 1 levels in patient fibroblasts are reduced to 0 . 14 of the controls  . Normalized Mfn 1 and 2 levels are shown as mean±½SD . After laser photoactivation of a region  , cells were tracked for 30 min . PA-GFP signal intensity  is recorded every 3 minutes , and the rate of decrease of average GFP signal is a measure of mitochondrial fusion . Fusion rates are significantly decreased in the IBMPFD patient fibroblasts when compared to the healthy control  . DOI: http://dx . Mfn 1 and 2 levels in VCP RH cells were reduced to 0 . 14 respectively , as compared with age and gender matched healthy control cells  . To explore the functional significance of this decrease , we carried out mitochondrial fusion assays using fibroblasts from healthy controls and patients . Both cell populations were transfected with a plasmid encoding a mitochondrial matrix targeted , photoactivated GFP  . Following photoactivation of GFP within a region of the cell , the GFP fluorescence signal spreads and the intensity decreases as these mitochondria fuse with non-activated neighboring mitochondria . Thus , in this assay an increased rate of fluorescence loss corresponds to increased mitochondrial fusion activity  . In control cells , PA-GFP gradually decreases after photoactivation; in the VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells , the GFP signal decrease is significantly delayed  . These data suggest that the VCP RH mutation results in a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels that lead to impaired mitochondrial fusion . In addition , the VCP mutant impairs both basal and maximal mitochondrial respiratory function . It has been controversial in the field whether VCP disease mutants with increased ATPase activity behave as dominant-active or dominant-negative mutants . Some studies show that VCP RH and AE , with enhanced ATPase activity  , result in hyperactivity in animal disease models  . However , other cell-based studies suggest they behave in a dominant negative fashion  . Understanding how VCP disease mutants behave is critical for understanding the disease process and finding possible therapies . We hypothesize that if an abnormally enhanced ATPase activity causes pathology , disease severity should ameliorate if ATPase activity is decreased through the use of VCP ATPase inhibitors . To test this hypothesis , we characterized the effects of VCP inhibitors in vivo . NMS-873 or ML240 feeding resulted in dramatic mitochondrial elongation in wildtype animals as visualized with MitoGFP using light microscopy  and at the ultrastructural level using EM  . These phenotypes are similar to those observed following VCP RNAi  . The smaller mitochondria phenotype associated with overexpression of VCP WT was also significantly suppressed following feeding with 30 µM NMS-873 or 30 µM ML240  . Feeding with NMS-873 and ML240 also reversed the phenotypic rescue of mitochondrial defects caused by expression of VCP WT , RH and AE in PINK1 mutants  . Supporting these results , feeding with NMS-873 also resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the levels of Mfn  . Together , these observations suggest that NMS-873 and ML240 inhibit endogenous VCP in vivo , resulting in a phenocopy of loss of VCP function . Compared to DMSO-fed flies , 10 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding results in more fused mitochondria in 2-day-old flies . This phenotype is reversed by 30 µM NMS-873  or 30 µM ML240  feeding and shifted towards a pro-fusion direction , as the mitochondria are also elongated as compared with WT  . In wildtype flies , 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding results in a mitochondrial size increase to 6 . Feeding of 30 µM NMS-873  or ML240  reverses these effects . 5 µM and 1 µM for 14 hr . DOI: http://dx . MitoGFP assay shows that NMS-873 and ML240 feeding blocks the ability of VCP WT to rescue PINK1 mutant mitochondrial phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner . The rescue effect is significantly blocked with 10 µM NMS-873  and 20 µM ML240  . 10 µM NMS-873 blocks VCP WT  , RH  and AE  rescue of PINK1 mutant mitochondrial phenotypes  as does feeding with 15 µM ML240 in rescue flies of VCP WT  , RH  and AE  in PINK1 mutant . DOI: http://dx . In control and VCP WT expressing flies , NMS-873 and ML240 feeding resulted in normal development to adulthood  and did not cause muscle death or tissue damage; all muscles were TUNEL negative and had an intact tissue structure  . Strikingly , NMS-873 and ML240 feeding largely prevented muscle cell death caused by expression of VCP RH or AE  . It also significantly rescued disrupted muscle integrity  . It is interesting to note that in the VCP disease mutants feeding groups  , mitochondria remained somewhat smaller as compared to wildtype in Figure 7B . Elongated mitochondria , such as those observed in the wildtype and VCP WT feeding groups  , were never observed in the VCP RH and VCP AE groups even though all were fed the same concentration of inhibitors . This partial suppression further suggests that these mutants are hyperactive . Finally , we note that VCP inhibitor feeding also resulted in significant rescue of a number of other phenotypes in VCP RH and AE expressing flies , including those associated with p62 , ubiquitin and TDP43  . Together , these observations suggest that VCP disease mutants are hyperactive in multiple aspects , and that disease phenotypes can be suppressed by inhibition of VCP ATPase activity . VCP inhibitors block mitochondrial defects , muscle tissue damage and muscle cell death in VCP disease mutant flies . Expression of VCP RH and AE leads to muscle cell death by 6 days after eclosion , as visualized through loss of MitoGFP and TUNEL positive signal in nuclei . 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding since first instar larvae till 6 days after eclosion significantly blocks the muscle cell death , with 64 . Data are shown as mean±½SD . Independent t test is used . Three independent rounds are performed , 15–20 flies are used each round . Toluidine Blue staining shows that 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding significantly rescue the disrupted muscle structure in VCP RH and AE flies . EM shows that 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 feeding significantly rescue the broken myofibril structure and small mitochondria with broken cristae phenotypes in VCP RH and AE flies . In 6-day-old flies , 30 µM NMS-873  or ML240  treatments result in a significant decrease in Ref  P/p62  and ubiquitin  aggregates in VCP RH and AE expressing flies; TDP43 mislocalization  is partially rescued as the large sarcoplasmic signal decreases , but no nuclear signal is observed  . DOI: http://dx . org/10 . TUNEL/MitoGFP assay shows that feeding of 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 does not cause muscle cell death in WT  and VCP WT flies  . Toluidine Blue assay shows that feeding of 30 µM NMS-873 or ML240 does not disrupt muscle integrity in WT  and VCP WT flies  . DOI: http://dx . 020 The above data demonstrated a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels , mitochondrial fusion defects and impaired mitochondrial respiratory function in IBMPFD patient cells . In patient cells , a high concentration of ML240  or NMS-873  led to cell death , and NMS-873 directly inhibits mitochondrial respiration  . However , when lower concentrations of ML240 are used , robust rescue effects are observed  . As shown in Figure 9A , immortalized IBMPFD patient fibroblasts have decreased Mfn 1 levels , and these are increased by treatment with 250 nM ML240 for 6 hr . Overall mitochondrial morphology of IBMPFD fibroblasts does not change in response to inhibitor treatment  . However , in a more sensitive assay in which rates of fusion are measured directly , mitochondrial fusion defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts were significantly rescued after 6 hr of treatment with 250 nM ML240  . Finally , 50 nM and 100 nM ML240 treatment for 4 days also significantly enhanced the basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate  in patient fibroblasts  . Similarly , 1 nM and 10 nM NMS-873 treatment for 6 days significantly enhanced the maximal oxygen consumption rate  in patient fibroblasts as well  . The fact that two inhibitors with different mechanisms generate similar results in terms of rescuing IBMFPD pathologies reduces the likelihood that these are off-targeting effects . Together , these data strongly support the effects of VCP inhibitors as potential therapeutic tools for IBMPFD disease . 50 nM and 100 nM ML240 treatment for 4 days significantly increases basal  and maximal oxygen consumption rate  in the IBMPFD patient fibroblasts harboring VCPR155H/+ mutation . 1 nM and 10 nM NMS-873 treatment for 6 days significantly increases maximal oxygen consumption rate  , but not basal oxygen consumption rate  . Welch’s unpaired t test is used . Treatment of these cells with 100nM ML240 treatment for 4 days  or 10 nM NMS-873 treatment for 6 days  also does not result in a change in mitochondrial morphology  . Anti-Tom20 antibody is used for mitochondial morphology assay . Moreover , the molecular mechanisms by which VCP mutations alter mitochondrial function are unclear . Here , we have investigated the endogenous function of VCP , cellular effects of expression of VCP disease mutants , and the ability of VCP inhibitors to suppress VCP disease pathology in Drosophila and patient fibroblasts . Loss of VCP function leads to increased Mfn levels and increased mitochondrial size in multiple tissues . Conversely , VCP overexpression results in reduced Mfn levels and decreased mitochondrial size . VCP physically interacts with Mfn via domains that are also used to bind its substrates in other contexts . Here we provide the first in vivo evidence in muscle , the major disease tissue in IBMPFD , that Mfn is a specific endogenous target of VCP . Regulation of endogenous Mfn by VCP is unexpected , given that VCP is an abundant protein implicated in multiple cellular processes , but has not been shown to localize to mitochondria that are not depolarized by CCCP . Proposed mechanisms of VCP disease mutants mediated mitochondrial defects and potential therapeutic role of VCP inhibitors . Under physiological conditions , VCP , independent of PINK1/parkin and Mul1 , negatively regulates Mfn protein levels , which are critical for the proper balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission . In the IBMPFD disease , the enhanced ATPase activity of a VCP disease mutant protein results in excessive loss of Mfn and mitochondrial fusion , leading to mitochondrial fusion defects . Besides the mitochondrial defects , VCP disease mutants also generate pathology including adult muscle tissue damage and muscle cell death . VCP ATPase inhibitors robustly relieve the pathology caused by VCP disease mutants associated with hyperactive VCP activity while leaving normal VCP-dependent functions intact . org/10 . We generated an IBMPFD disease model in adult Drosophila muscle , and used this system to monitor tissue pathology , and investigate the molecular mechanisms by which VCP disease mutants function . We show that compared to VCP WT , expression of VCP disease mutants results in tissue damage , mitochondrial fusion defects and decreased levels of Mfn  . These phenotypes are opposite to those associated with decreased levels of VCP , or expression of an ATPase defective mutant version of VCP . Expression of VCP disease mutants , but not a VCP ATPase defective mutant or VCP RNAi , also suppresses the mitochondrial defects mediated by accumulation of Mfn in PINK1 null , parkin null , and parkin mul1 double null mutants . Taken together , these results suggest that VCP disease mutants do not function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants , but rather as dominant activated mutants in regulating Mfn levels and bringing about mitochondrial fusion defects . This conclusion is further supported by our findings that mitochondrial fusion and Mfn levels are also decreased in VCP disease mutant fibroblasts . Our finding that VCP overexpression suppresses a parkin null mutant in addition to a PINK1 null stands in contrast to what was reported in Kim et al . In addition , we also find that VCP overexpression suppresses phenotypes due to double mutants of parkin and mul1 , which acts in a parallel pathway to degrade Mfn  . The VCP-dependent degradation of Mfn we observe is also specific and unlikely to be mediated through a more general process such as mitophagy , as levels of several other mitochondrial proteins are not altered by VCP overexpression . However , these results do not exclude models in which Parkin activation further promotes VCP-dependent Mfn degradation , which may or may not involve mitophagy , under some conditions . Regarding the mechanisms of VCP disease mutant action , in vitro biochemistry studies suggest that they have increased ATPase activities , thus favoring a dominant active model  . In addition , in vivo data from Drosophila shows that eye phenotypes caused by VCP disease mutant expression can be alleviated through loss of one copy of wildtype VCP . This also is consistent with models in which VCP mutants have increased activity  . In contrast , in cell culture studies Bartolome , et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression led to mitochondria respiratory chain defects , as did VCP RNAi  ; Ritz , et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression impaired endocytosis to the same extent as that of VCP ATPase defective mutants  . While the above studies can be interpreted as showing that VCP disease mutants function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants , these results do not rule out the possibility that disease mutants are hyperactive alleles . For example , an alternative interpretation of the impairment of respiratory chain function observed following VCP disease mutant expression or following VCP RNAi is that either an increase or a decrease in the levels of VCP activity leads to mitochondrial defects , which is what we observed in this study . Of course , in order for VCP inhibitors to be useful as therapeutics , it will be necessary to inhibit mutant forms of VCP to an extent sufficient to suppress disease without bringing about a deleterious decrease in the activity of wildtype VCP . Our observation that Drosophila fed inhibitors are suppressed with respect to VCP disease phenotypes , but otherwise develop normally , suggests that this therapeutic goal may be possible . All cDNAs were subcloned into pUASt vectors as translational fusions fused with the 6 Myc tag using the Gateway cloning system  .

         "Mammals produce volatile odours that convey different types of societal information . In Homo sapiens , this is now recognised as body odour , a key chemical component of which is the sulphurous thioalcohol , 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol ( 3M3SH ) . Volatile 3M3SH is produced in the underarm as a result of specific microbial activity , which act on the odourless dipeptide-containing malodour precursor molecule , S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , secreted in the axilla ( underarm ) during colonisation . The mechanism by which these bacteria recognise S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and produce body odour is still poorly understood . Here we report the structural and biochemical basis of bacterial transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by Staphylococcus hominis , which is converted to the sulphurous thioalcohol component 3M3SH in the bacterial cytoplasm , before being released into the environment . Knowledge of the molecular basis of precursor transport , essential for body odour formation , provides a novel opportunity to design specific inhibitors of malodour production in humans .\nIn Homo sapiens the skin of the underarm ( axilla ) provides a unique niche for bacteria . Through the secretions of various glands , that open onto the skin or into hair follicles , this environment is nutrient-rich and hosts a unique microbial community ( Taylor et al . , 2003 ) . Esterified fatty acids and other lipids are secreted by the sebaceous gland , while the eccrine glands produce a dilute salt solution with lactate and other organic solutes being secreted ( Bovell , 2015 ) . A third exocrine gland , the apocrine , which is more specialized and found only in the axilla , areolae , genitalia and external auditory meatus ( ear canal ) ( Collins , 1989 ) , starts secreting an odourless lipid-rich viscous secretion with the onset of puberty ( Figure 1A ) . The lipid rich secretion is not involved in thermoregulation like the eccrine gland and in mammals has a likely role in scent generation ( Collins , 1989 ) . In humans , the link between the axillary apocrine gland , underarm bacteria and body odour ( BO ) , was first recognised over 50 years ago ( Shelley et al . , 1953 ) and early culture-based studies on this relationship found the axillary microbiota to be dominated by Staphylococcus , Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium species , with the Corynebacteria in particular correlating with malodour intensity ( Taylor et al . , 2003; Leyden et al . , 1981 ) . More recent culture-independent meta-taxonomic studies have confirmed that the axilla is dominated by these genera , although the presence of additional taxa not previously indicated by culture-based methods is also evident , notably Gram-positive anaerobic cocci ( GPAC ) belonging to the Anaerococcus and Peptoniphilus genera ( Costello et al . , 2009; Egert et al . , 2011; Troccaz et al . , 2015 ) . Various molecules produced in the axilla have been linked to malodour , including 16-androstene steroids ( Gower et al . , 1994 ) and short-chain ( C2-C5 ) volatile fatty acids ( VFAs ) produced by axillary bacteria via several metabolic routes ( James et al . , 2004 ) . However , 16-androstenes are now believed to be only minor contributors to axillary malodour ( James et al . , 2013 ) , and it is accepted that the VFAs most heavily involved in BO are a series of structurally-unusual medium-chain ( C6-C10 ) acids originating from N-acylglutamine precursors present in apocrine sweat ( Natsch et al . , 2003; Natsch et al . , 2006 ) . A third class of molecule , the thioalcohols ( also called sulfanylalkanols ) , have recently been identified as important components of human body odour and a number of these have been detected within the volatiles released from the underarm ( Troccaz et al . , 2004; Natsch et al . , 2004; Hasegawa et al . , 2004 ) . They are particularly pungent and can be detected in pg . l−1 quantities , an order of magnitude lower than many other volatile chemicals emanating from the skin ( Natsch et al . , 2004 ) . The most abundant and pungent of these thioalcohols is 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol ( 3M3SH ) ( Figure 1B ) , which is a primary causal molecule of axillary malodour and subsequent BO ( Troccaz et al . , 2004; Hasegawa et al . , 2004 ) . Thioalcohols are known to be released as a peptide-conjugated precursor from the apocrine gland , which secretes directly into the hair follicle ( Figure 1A ) . The biosynthetic origin of the thioalcohol precursors is currently poorly understood , but they are thought to be secreted into the axilla via the ABC transporter ABCC11 as odourless glutathione conjugates ( Baumann et al . , 2014a ) . The glutathione conjugated form ( SG-3M3SH ) has never been detected in axillary sweat; however , the L-cysteinylglycine dipeptide conjugated form , S-[1- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) −1-methylbutyl]-L-cysteinylglycine ( S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ) ( Figure 1B ) , is readily detectable ( Starkenmann et al . , 2005 ) and recently a γ-glutamyl transferase ( GGT1 ) has been demonstrated to localise to the apocrine sweat gland and convert SG-3M3SH to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Baumann et al . , 2014a ) ( Figure 1C ) . We and others have demonstrated that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH can be taken up and metabolised by a highly limited range of staphylococcal species present in the axilla , namely Staphylococcus hominis , Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylocooccus lugdunensis , to liberate 3M3SH , that subsequently exits the cell through an undefined mechanism ( Troccaz et al . , 2004; Starkenmann et al . , 2005; Bawdon et al . , 2015 ) . A strong correlation between S . hominis and body odour production has recently been established using culture-independent taxonomic studies of the axillary microbiota ( Troccaz et al . , 2015 ) , confirming the biological significance of this low-abundance species within the axilla in BO production in humans . However , the mechanism by which the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH precursor molecule is taken up into S . hominis and related thioalcohol producers is currently unknown , hampering efforts to identify novel mechanisms to disrupt this process and control odour production in humans . Here we identify the biochemical and structural basis for the recognition and specific transport of the malodour precursor peptide , S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , into S . hominis . We first show that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is actively taken up by S . hominis through a specific secondary active transporter , STAH0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) , a member of the proton coupled oligopeptide transporter ( POT ) family ( Hagting et al . , 1994; Paulsen and Skurray , 1994 ) . Through a combination of structural , biochemical and cell based assays we reveal how this peptide transporter is able to recognise a thioalcohol-conjugated peptide and further , show that transport is coupled to the inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient . Our results suggest that SH1446 is a clear target for inhibitor design to prevent malodour production , thus providing further molecular insights into the role of the skin microbiota in human scent generation .\nTo elucidate how thiol-conjugated dipeptides are transported by bacteria , we first examined the model organism Escherichia coli , which is able to recognise and metabolise the dipeptide version of the non-physiological malodour precursor S-benzyl-L-cysteine , namely , S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine ( James et al . , 2013 ) . Resting cells of E . coli were indeed able to remove S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine from solution and break it down to release the thiol active product , benzyl mercaptan ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A , B ) . Following transport into the cell , the dipeptide must be cleaved to release the benzyl mercaptan , most likely through a cysteine-S-conjugate β-lyase-type activity , for which a number have been described in E . coli , including MetC and MalY ( Dwivedi et al . , 1982; Zdych et al . , 1995; Awano et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , TnaA which is a tryptophanase known to have L-cysteine desulfhydrase activity ( Awano et al . , 2005 ) is also capable of releasing benzyl mercaptan . Individual disruption of metC and malY did not decrease the amount of benzyl mercaptan produced by E . coli , while disruption of tnaA led to an almost complete loss of biotransformation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) . This suggests that E . coli takes up the S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine , whereupon a host dipeptidase cleaves the glycine residue prior to cleavage of the S-benzyl-cysteine by TnaA to release the benzyl mercaptan . To discover the genetic basis of the transport and metabolism of these thiol-conjugated dipeptides , we exploited the knock out ( KO ) library of single gene disruptions in E . coli K-12 ( Baba et al . , 2006 ) . We hypothesised that the dipeptide moiety might direct the molecule through a peptide transporter . In E . coli the main peptide systems are relatively well characterised , the two main transport systems belong to the ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) family and the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter ( POT ) family ( Figure 2B ) . The E . coli Opp and Dpp ABC transporters have been extensively studied in E . coli and the closely related bacterium Salmonella typhimurium ( Smith et al . , 1999; Klepsch et al . , 2011; Abouhamad et al . , 1991; Goodell and Higgins , 1987; Tame et al . , 1995 ) and an E . coli BW25113 strain with non-functional Opp and Dpp system ( ΔDB1 ) , was used to assess the role of these transporters in the production of benzyl mercaptan . Surprisingly , benzyl mercaptan production was similar to the wild-type strain , suggesting that neither ABC transporter was important for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport ( Figure 2A ) . Having ruled out transport via the ABC peptide transporters , we then broadened our search to include additional peptide transporters that have been described in E . coli . These were the four members of the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter , or POT family , encoded by dtpA-D , that have poorly defined physiological roles during growth on peptides ( Harder et al . , 2008; Prabhala et al . , 2014; Casagrande et al . , 2009 ) , the CstA protein , orthologues of which have been demonstrated to be peptide transporters ( Garai et al . , 2016 ) and the Sap system , which is implicated in uptake of cationic antimicrobial peptides ( Groisman et al . , 1992 ) . Most of these strains had similar levels of benzyl mercaptan production to the wild-type , with the exception of dtpB which had an overall 50% drop in thiol production ( Figure 2A ) . These data suggest that transporters belonging to the POT family are most likely responsible for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport , revealing a new biological role for bacterial POT transporters in the uptake of Cys-Gly- ( S ) conjugates . Having established that E . coli has the ability to transport and cleave a Cys-Gly- ( S ) conjugated substrate , we reasoned that overexpression of a POT transporter might confer the ability to recognise the physiological malodour precursor S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The four dtp genes were cloned into a pBAD vector commonly used for overexpression of membrane transporters ( Mulligan et al . , 2009; Mulligan et al . , 2012 ) and transformed into the wild-type E . coli background . The ability of the resulting strains to convert S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH to 3M3SH was subsequently measured ( Bawdon et al . , 2015 ) . Consistent with the reduction in benzyl mercaptan production reported in Figure 2A , the dtpB gene alone was able to confer a malodour production ( BO+ ) phenotype to E . coli , which was not seen with any of the other dtp genes ( Figure 2C ) . The same pattern was observed with S-benzyl-Cys-Gly as a substrate ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) , suggesting that DtpB has a unique ability to transport these unusual conjugated peptides . The molecular basis for S-Cys-Gly-3M3H transport into malodour producing staphylococci is unknown , and the genetic intractability of these poorly studied coagulase negative Staphylococcal species makes it difficult to study using genetic approaches . We therefore used an alternative approach exploiting our discovery that expression of a transporter in trans could produce a BO+ phenotype to E . coli . Given our discovery that E . coli POT family peptide transporters can transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , we examined the genome of S . hominis SK1119 , as S . hominis are the most abundant malodour producing Staphylococcal species in the underarm microbiota . Unlike E . coli , S . hominis contains only a single POT family member DtpT ( SH1446 ) , orthologues of which were seen in all sequenced staphylococci ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ) . The POT peptide systems remain largely uncharacterised in staphyoloccci , although in the well-studied pathogen S . aureus , the single POT transporter encoded by dtpT is the sole route for dipeptide uptake in this species ( Hiron et al . , 2007 ) . We also identified a second system , encoded by STAHO0001_0415 ( SH0415 ) , which is annotated as an MFS transporter and only present in S . hominis and S . haemolyticus , two known thioalcohol producers , and which is genetically linked to genes involved in peptide and amino acid metabolism ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3B ) . Both transporters were cloned into pBADcLIC2005 and transformed into E . coli for functional analysis . When levels of 3M3SH production were measured in these strains , uptake was only enhanced by the presence of SH1446 , with SH0415 having little effect on 3M3SH activity ( Figure 2D ) . In contrast , with S-benzyl-cysteinlyglycine as a substrate , there was no increase in production of benzyl mercaptan with SH1446 but a significant increase was observed with SH0415 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) . Together these data strongly support the conclusion that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transporter in S . hominis is the POT transporter STAH0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) . To further demonstrate the importance of SH1446 in the physiological transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH we used a biochemical approach to examine whether peptides could inhibit 3M3SH production by competing with S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH uptake . Firstly , we used our E . coli system where 3M3SH production is seen when SH1446 is expressed in trans and we observed clear inhibition of 3M3SH production with both di- and tri-Ala peptides ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) but not with L-Ala alone nor tetra-Ala . The purified TnaA enzyme that cleaves Cys-3M3SH was not inhibited by any of these peptides ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5 ) , supporting the hypothesis that the whole cell inhibition is due to inhibition of peptide transport . Similarly , we measured the ability of the same peptides to inhibit 3M3SH production directly in S . hominis﻿ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4﻿ ) and observed a comparable profile . It should be noted that a significant affect was observed for 25 mM tetra-Ala in S . hominis wild-type , however this affect is due to the acidic pH that was required to dissolve the peptide which appears to inhibit metabolism in S . hominis but not E . coli . POT transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily ( MFS ) and use an inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient to drive the concentrative uptake of di- and tri-peptides across the cell membrane for metabolic assimilation ( Daniel and Kottra , 2004 ) . To establish SH1446 as the protein responsible for S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH recognition and transport , the gene was cloned and overexpressed in E . coli for functional and structural studies . The purified protein , hereafter referred to as PepTSh ( Peptide Transporter Staphylococcus hominis ) was purified and reconstituted into liposomes . Transport was studied using a previously employed pyranine based reporter assay , which measures transport via changes to the internal pH of the liposomes ( Parker et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 3A ) . Acidification of the lumen of the liposome was observed in the presence of a membrane potential ( ΔΨ , negative inside ) , and addition of external di- or tri-peptide substrate , demonstrating that PepTSh is a proton coupled peptide transporter . Importantly we also observed acidification in the presence of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH precursor peptide , confirming our earlier identification of PepTSh as the transporter for this molecule in S . hominis . To understand the recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH compared to natural peptides , we determined IC50 values using competition with 3H-di-alanine . The IC50 value for tri-alanine , di-alanine and Cys-Gly were 23 . 7 ± 3 . 4 , 72 . 2 ± 9 . 7 and 115 ± 22 . 2 μM , respectively ( Figure 3B ) , indicating that PepTSh is able to recognise tri-Ala more favourably than di-Ala . However , for S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH the IC50 value was 362 ± 21 . 8 μM , three-fold higher than the Cys-Gly peptide . Our data therefore show that while PepTSh can transport the modified peptide , the addition of the thioalcohol group on the cysteine side chain has substantially impaired the recognition and transport versus natural peptides . To gain further insight into the mechanism of substrate binding we successfully obtained a high-resolution co-crystal structure of PepTSh at 2 . 5 Å resolution , bound to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH using the in meso crystallisation method ( Figure 4A , Table 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . PepTSh adopts the canonical MFS fold with helices H1-H6 forming the N-terminal bundle and H7-H12 the C-terminal bundle . PepTSh was crystallised in an inward open state , observed previously for other members of the POT family ( Newstead , 2015 ) , wherein the extracellular gate , consisting of helices H1-2 and H7-8 from the N- and C-terminal bundles respectively , is closed and the intracellular gate , consisting of helices H4-5 and H10-11 is open . Similar to other bacterial POT family members , PepTSh contains two additional helices inserted between the N- and C-terminal bundles , termed HA and HB ( Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Unlike previous POT structures however , PepTSh also contains a well-structured β-hairpin motif between helices H7 and H8 on the extracellular side of the membrane , extending out in line with the lipid head groups . Interestingly we observed a number of monoolein lipid molecules that cluster around both the β- hairpin and the cavity created between helices HA and HB with the transporter domain . The role of helices HA and HB in prokaryotic POT family transporters still remains unclear . However , the observation of lipid molecules bound between these helices and the transport domain suggests a possible role in stabilising these transporters in the membrane , which may be an adaption specific to prokaryotic members of the POT family ( Newstead et al . , 2011 ) . Following extensive screening and co-crystallisation we observed clear mFo-DFc difference electron density for the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ligand in the peptide binding site ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . The Cys-Gly part of the precursor is positioned such that the carboxy termini of the peptide faces towards the intracellular side of the binding site . The terminal carboxyl group makes two hydrogen bond interactions , one with Tyr41 on H1 and a second interaction to a water molecule ( W107 ) , which links the carboxyl group with Asn347 on H8 . The carbonyl group of the CG peptide also makes a hydrogen bond to this water molecule , creating a well-coordinated interaction network between the peptide and Asn347 ( Figure 4D ) . The terminal amino group makes two further polar interactions , with a water molecule that sits next to Tyr41 and also to the carbonyl group of Gln344 , which sits further up on H8 . In contrast , the thioalcohol moiety points towards the extracellular gate , with the sulphur atom sitting close to Gln310 on H7 , whereas the alcohol group extends towards helix H8 making interactions with backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Phe343 and Asn347 , respectively . The acyl group extends into a large pocket nestled between helices H7 and H10 ( Figure 4E ) . This long pocket ( ~10 Å ) extends from the central peptide binding site into the C-terminal bundle of the transporter and is both hydrophobic and polar in character . Previously , we showed that a related POT family transporter , PepTSt , is able to bind peptides in different orientations in the binding site , with a di-peptide adopting a horizontal position and a tri-peptide a vertical one ( Lyons et al . , 2014 ) and suggested this flexibility may be responsible for the accomodation of larger peptide ligands ( Newstead , 2017 ) . Here we see that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide adopts a more vertical orientation , similar to the tri-alanine position in PepTSt . However , there are significant differences in the interactions . A structural overlay of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide shows that it sits much further up in the binding site compared to the natural peptides captured in PepTSt ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4A & B ) , most likely as a result of the requirement to accommodate the thioalcohol group in the extended pocket . This has a knock-on effect with respect to the position of the amino and carboxy termini . In PepTSt , the amino terminal group of the di-peptide directly interacts with helix H8 and H10 , whereas the tri-peptide makes a much weaker interaction through a carbonyl group . In contrast , in PepTSh this interaction is achieved through a water mediated hydrogen bond ( Figure 4D ) . The role of water in mediating interactions between peptides and their binding sites has been previously observed in the ABC transporter binding domains ( Tame et al . , 1995 ) , albeit for side chain independent binding . A similar mechanism may be employed by PepTSh to facilitate transport of modified peptides by replacing direct interactions between the peptide and the transporter when these are sterically restricted , as we observe with S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The interaction of the amino termini of peptides with both the mammalian and bacterial POT family transporters has been identified as facilitating high affinity binding ( Weitz et al . , 2007; Meredith et al . , 2000 ) . The reduced IC50 value for the modified peptide in PepTSh ( Figure 3B ) , may therefore be a combination of steric restraints resulting in the accommodation of the extended side chain group , and the subsequent knock on effects on the position of the interactions between the amino and carboxy groups with conserved side chains in the binding site . S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is the first human derived peptide with a modified side chain to be captured in a POT family transporter , and contains biochemical features similar to physiological peptides ( Cys-Gly ) , but also incorporates the non-peptide thioalcohol group ( 3M3SH ) . We therefore wished to explore whether S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is recognised using a similar mechanism to physiological peptides . Several mutations in the binding site that have previously been shown to play an important role in peptide recognition within the bacterial POT family were therefore generated ( Newstead , 2017 ) . Tyrosine 41 forms part of a conserved E33xxERFxYY41 motif on TM1 ( Solcan et al . , 2012 ) , which plays a role in proton coupling and influences peptide uptake in several POT family members ( Doki et al . , 2013; Ernst et al . , 2009; Guettou et al . , 2014; Lyons et al . , 2014 ) . In PepTSh Tyr41 hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl terminus of the terminal glycine amino acid in S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Figure 4C , D ) . Mutating Tyr41 to phenylalanine or alanine severely reduced transport of di-alanine compared to WT protein ( Figure 5A ) . A similar negative effect on transport was observed in the related POT family transporter PepTSt , from Streptococcus thermophilus ( Solcan et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting a common role for the conserved tyrosine in peptide recognition within the POT family . We then used the same variants in our whole cell assay for 3M3SH production . Interestingly , while both Tyr41Phe and Tyr41Ala variants had reduced activity , at about 50% of the wild-type protein ( Figure 5B ) , the phenotype was not as severe as that observed in the liposome based assay . We interpret this result to indicate that recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is less dependent on this residue than di-Ala . We next wanted to test the role of other residues we observed sitting close to the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ligand . In particular , we were interested in the contribution made by the Asn347 and Glu418 , which coordinate a water molecule ( W107 ) linking both the carboxyl and carbonyl groups of the ligand to the binding site ( Figure 4B ) . The equivalent residues in homologous POT family transporters have been implicated in both peptide recognition ( Lyons et al . , 2014 ) and gating ( Solcan et al . , 2012 ) , and in the case of Glu418 may facilitate the coupling between peptide recognition , proton movement and transport ( Parker et al . , 2017 ) . Although a Glu418Ala variant had no activity in our assays , consistent with its proposed role in coordinating the intracellular gate ( Fowler et al . , 2015 ) , we observed reduced uptake of di-Ala in the Asn347Ala variant ( Figure 5A ) . Interestingly , this reduction was far more severe in the in vivo assay ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that this interaction is more important for transport of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide than di-Ala . This may reflect the requirement of Asn347 to coordinate the water molecule linking the peptide to the intracellular gate side chain Glu418 , which in the case of the di-peptide may interact directly as in PepTSt , lessening the requirement for the Asn347 interaction . The co-crystal structure also identified the acyl chain portion of the thioalcohol group was accommodated within an extended pocket , formed near the extracellular side of the binding site ( Figure 4E ) . To test the importance of this pocket on S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transport , we made a Tyr411Trp variant , which would block the cavity . Uptake was noticeably reduced , but still measurable at ~19% compared to WT ( Figure 5A ) . The same mutation resulted in a similar large decrease in the biotransformation of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , while a Tyr411Ala mutation had wild-type biotransformation rates ( Figure 5B ) . It is clear that the hydrophobic pocket in PepTSh plays an important role in facilitating the recognition of the thioalcohol group in the binding pocket and , as discussed below , is a potential site for inhibitor design . Taken together the current data lend further support to our model of an adaptable binding site within the POT family that can accommodate chemically diverse peptides and their derivatives through the use of both side chain and water mediated interactions with conserved residues and different specificity pockets to accommodate the different chemical side chains .\nThe production of malodour by humans is an evolutionary ancient olfactory process that likely was involved in mate selection and evolutionary processes that relied on chemical signalling ( Stoddart , 1990 ) . Evidence for the microbial origins of chemical signalling molecules is also seen in other animals such as foxes , deer , cats and beetles ( Wyatt , 2003 ) , but the details of this process in humans is less well understood . The thioalcohol 3M3SH , a major component of body odour , is produced in the human axilla as a glutathione-conjugated precursor and is processed to a unique dipeptide structure ( Figure 1 ) . The discovery that axilla-isolated strains of S . hominis , S . lugdunensis and S . heamolyticus are able to produce 3M3SH prompted the search for the molecular basis for this process ( Bawdon et al . , 2015 ) . While S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is a highly modified and uniquely human dipeptide , we reasoned that this moiety might dictate the uptake mechanism into malodour producing bacteria and here we identify a peptide transporter , PepTSh ( SH1446 ) , from the POT family of secondary active transporters as being responsible for this process . Each of these strains have a POT family transporter that is closely related to PepTSh ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , and we would predict they will also be able to uptake S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The genetic intractability of S . hominis dictated that we use a biochemical approach to demonstrate that SH1446 is likely the sole route of uptake of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . First , this staphylococci has a similar repertoire of peptide transporters in S . aureus , in that it has a single POT transporter and one Opp ABC transporter , and previous work in S . aureus has demonstrated that the POT transporter , DtpT , is essential for growth on dipeptides and some tripeptides , while the ABC transporter ( Opp3 ) has a function in transporting longer oligopeptides ( Hiron et al . , 2007 ) . The use of L-Ala containing peptides as inhibitors in this study demonstrates an inhibitory effect on 3M3SH production that is consistent with the properties of a POT family transporter . Several attempts were made to genetically disrupt SH1446 in S . hominis , using tools developed for S . aureus and S . epidermidis , but these were unsuccessful , most likely due to the presence of multiple species-specific restriction modification ( RM ) systems which render this organism , as with many other coagulase negative ( CoNS ) species , genetically intractable . The specific role for POT transporters in the transport of these unusually modified dipeptides is supported from the inability of the E . coli ABC transporters for oligopeptides and dipeptides , Opp and Dpp , to recognise and transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . Given that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is effectively a dipeptide with a highly extended R-group on the first amino acid , it is noteworthy that only the promiscuous nature of the POT binding site is able to recognise this ligand . For OppA and DppA , the substrate binding proteins that initially recognise peptides transported by the ABC systems , the binding pocket is well defined and makes general main chain-main chain interactions to ensure that the protein can bind peptides in a sequence independent manner ( Tame et al . , 1995; Sleigh et al . , 1997; Sleigh et al . , 1999 ) . However , the pocket has evolved to accommodate regular amino acid side chains and the unusually large structure of the thioalcohol attachment would likely be sterically incompatible with recognition by either OppA or DppA . The data presented here further support the idea that POT transporters have an unusually promiscuous binding site that may play an evolutionary advantageous role in accepting modified peptides as substrates . Recently , the human POT family transporters , PepT1 and PepT2 , have gained additional attention due to their role in the absorption and retention of several important classes of drug molecule ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) , including peptide modified pro-drugs . Similar to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , these pro-drugs are drug molecules conjugated to a peptide or amino acid ( Brandsch , 2013 ) . Pro-drugs are able to compete with natural peptides for transport via PepT1 and PepT2 , and are therefore actively transported into the body ( Ganapathy et al . , 1998; Gupta et al . , 2013; Terada and Inui , 2012 ) . The promiscuous nature of the POT family binding site has been shown to derive , in part , from their ability to recognise peptides in different conformations and through the availability of different specificity pockets , which are able to accommodate chemically different classes of peptides ( Newstead , 2017 ) . Our results here provide the first evidence that specificity pockets can also accommodate exotic chemical extensions . The observation that water plays a role in facilitating the interaction between the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide and PepTSh may also indicate a broader role for water in facilitating the recognition of xenobiotic peptides . In particular , the observation that water may bridge interactions between the binding site and either the amino or carboxy group of the ligand would greatly increase the number of conformations a peptide could adopt in the transporter and still trigger proton coupled transport . Finally , we can ask the questions , why do these bacteria transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and can this process be inhibited to provide effective malodour control ? The presumed biochemical pathway for breakdown of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is outlined in Figure 6 . The firststep is the likely removal of the glycine by a dipeptidase and then the lyase reaction that cleaves the carbon-sulphur bond to release pyruvate and ammonia in addition to 3M3SH . The route of export of 3M3SH is unknown , but currently assumed to be diffusion across the bacterial inner membrane . The bacterium will gain a nutritional benefit from the catabolism of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH via the release of both nitrogen and carbon as glycine , pyruvate and ammonia ( Figure 6 ) , which may have been the evolutionary trigger for the adaptation to catabolise this chemical . Asian individuals with single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in ABCC11 , the transporters involved in the secretion of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Figure 1 ) have been studied ( Nakano et al . , 2009; Baumann et al . , 2014b ) . Recently , a microbiological investigation of individuals with wild-type alleles of ABCC11 compared to heterozygous and double mutant genotypes revealed that the proportion of Staphylococcus sp . is higher in the underarms of humans that produce the precursor ( Harker et al . , 2014 ) . While these studies are limited in that they do not provide species level identification , they are at least consistent with the idea that the production of the precursor positively correlates with the presence of Staphylococcus sp . in the underarm . The discovery of the transporter and molecular understanding of the mode of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH binding now suggests a specific route to develop inhibitors of malodour production by directly inhibiting the transporter SH1446 ( Grice , 2014 ) . Importantly , such intervention would not impact on the overall axillar microbiome , but instead specifically target the reduction in body odour production .\nEscherichia coli K-12 was used as the model organism throughout this study . Escherichia coli K-12 single gene deletions were obtained from the in-house E . coli Keio collection at University of York . Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1 and 2 . All strains were cultured in LB ( 1% tryptone , 0 . 5% yeast extract , 1% NaCl ) unless otherwise stated , Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations Ampicillin 100 μg/mL and Kanamycin 50 μg/mL; L-arabinose concentrations are indicated . PCR , plasmid extractions , and transformations were carried out as per standard protocols . For routine cloning , genomic DNA was extracted from BW25113 and high fidelity KOD polymerase was used ( Novagen ) . Correct clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing . Specific details of plasmid constructions are detailed below . Multiple gene knockouts were created in single keio deletion strains . To create the double KO strain DB1 ( ΔoppC ΔdppC ) , the KanR cassette was removed from a target gene using pCP20 ( encoding Flp recombinase ) at 30°C , loss of antibiotic cassette was confirmed by PCR and sequencing . The second gene to be disrupted was PCR amplified with 100 bp homology including the FRT flanked KanR cassette from the single gene deletion strain in the keio collection . Targeted gene disruptions were created using λ Red recombination as previously described ( Datsenko and Wanner , 2000 ) . Overexpression of the E . coli POT transporters were cloned into pBADcLIC2005 vector under the control of arabinose . Full-length genes were amplified from E . coli BW25113 genomic DNA using high fidelity KOD polymerase ( Merck ) using the corresponding primers listed in Supplementary file 3 . In silico analysis of the available Staphylococcus hominis SK1119 genome identified STAH0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) as a POT family member which orthologues present in all sequenced staphylococci and a MFS transporter STAH0001_0415 ( SH0415 ) present in only S . hominis and S . haemolyticus . SH0415 and SH1446 genes were amplified from S . hominis genomic DNA using high fidelity KOD polymerase ( Merck ) using primers listed in Supplementary file 3 . All PCR products were purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System ( Promega ) , cloned into pBADcLIC2005 vector using standard ligation-independent cloning ( LIC ) techniques . All fragments were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing ( GATC Biotech ) . The wildtype STAHO0001_1446 ( SH1446 ) cloned onto the expression plasmid pBADcLIC2005 was used to individually generate the Y411W , Y411A , Y41A , Y41F , N167A and N347A mutants . To introduce the mutation , high fidelity inverse PCR was performed using divergent primers with one per pair being mutagenic ( Supplementary file 3 ) . The resultant products were then circularised by performing a blunt end ligation and transformed into E . coli BW25113 . The mutant sequences were verified by DNA sequencing ( GATC Biotech ) . S-Benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine and ( S ) - ( 1- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) −1-methylbutyl ) -L-cysteinylglycine ( S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ) ( Peakdale Molecular ) were prepared at a stock concentration of 10 mM in M9 salts ( 6 g Na2HPO4 g/L , 3 g KH2PO4 g/L , 0 . 5 g NaCl g/L ) and stored at 4°C . E . coli were grown overnight in LB , cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3 , 500 rpm 10 min and resuspended in sterile M9 salts . Where appropriate , E . coli strains harbouring inducible genes on the pBADcLIC2005 plasmid were pre-induced during overnight growth with 0 . 0001% L-arabinose . To a sterile Eppendorf the following was added; 2 mM substrate ( S-Benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine or S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ) , cells to an OD650nm of 5 and M9 salts up to 200 μL . Cells only ( no added substrate ) and substrate only ( no added cells ) reactions were also included in every individual experiment . The reactions were incubated at 37°C for up to 48 hr with samples taken at appropriate time points . Liberated thiols were quantified using either MTS/PMS or DTNB labelling as detailed below . Liberated benzyl mercaptan was labelled as follows , 500 μl from each reaction was taken at the appropriate time point and centrifuged at 13 000 r . p . m . for 2 min . To chemically label benzyl-mercaptan , 50 µl of labelling reagent , consisting of 4 . 09 mM 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) −5- ( 3-carboxymethoxyphenyl ) −2- ( 4-sulfophenyl ) −2H-tetrazolium ( MTS ) ( Promega ) and 0 . 2 mM phenazine methosulfate ( PMS ) ( Sigma ) ( Goodwin et al . , 1995 ) , dissolved in dH2O , was aliquoted into either a 96 well microplate or 0 . 5 ml Eppendorf tubes . For reactions using a 96 well microplate , 200 µl reaction supernatant was added to the pre- aliquoted 50 µl MTS/PMS . The plate was sealed with a semi-permeable film lid , incubated at room temperature for 50 min and the A492nm recorded on a Biotek PowerWave XS microplate spectrophotometer . The data was captured by KC junior and exported to Microsoft Excel . For reactions in Eppendorf tubes , 20 µl - 50 µl reaction supernatant was added to 50 µl MTS/PMS . The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 50 min . 20 µl was subsequently removed and diluted in 980 µl dH2O in a 1 . 5 ml disposable plastic cuvette . The A492nm was recorded . To quantify free 3M3SH , a 75 µl volume from each reaction ( isolated as described above ) was taken at the appropriate time point and centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 2 min . 950 µl labelling solution , consisting of: 800 µl dH2O , 100 µl UltraPure Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 50 µl DTNB ( Ellman , 1958 ) stock solution ( 50 mM sodium acetate , 2 mM DTNB , dissolved in dH2O ) was added to a 1 . 5 ml disposable cuvette . 50 µl reaction supernatant was added to the cuvette , mixed by pipetting and incubated at room temperature for 5 min . The A412nm was recorded on a Jenway 6305 spectrophotometer . ( Van Horn , 2003 ) . Where appropriate , E . coli strains harbouring inducible genes on the pBADcLIC2005 plasmid were pre-induced during overnight growth with 0 . 0001% L-arabinose . In all experiments cells only ( no added substrate ) and substrate only ( no added cells ) were also included . The gene encoding S . hominis SH1446 was cloned into a C-terminal octa histidine GFP fusion vector ( pWaldo-GFPe ) ( Drew et al . , 2006 ) and subsequently transformed into Escherichia coli C43 ( DE3 ) cells ( Miroux and Walker , 1996 ) . Mutations were introduced using site directed mutagenesis followed by DpnI digestion . An overnight starter culture was used to inoculate 4 L of Terrific Broth ( TB ) . Cells were left to grow at 37°C and aerated by shaking at 250 rpm . Overexpression of the fusion protein was induced when the culture reached an OD600 of ~0 . 6 , by adding isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) to a final concentration of 0 . 4 mM . Following induction , the temperature was reduced to 25°C . Cells were harvested 16 hr later , and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) containing deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas , and stored at −80°C . Unless stated , the following steps were carried out at 4°C . Cells were thawed and disrupted at 32 kpsi ( Constant Systems , UK ) . Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 30 , 000 x g for 30 min , and membranes were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 230 , 000 x g for 120 min . Membranes were resuspended in PBS using a dounce homogeniser , flash frozen , and stored at −80°C . Thawed membranes were diluted with 1x PBS ( 10 mL per gram of membrane ) , 20 mM imidazole ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 1% n-Dodecyl-β-D-maltoside ( DDM ) and left to solubilise for 60 min , stirring . Non-solubilised membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation at 230 , 000 g for 60 min . Nickel-NTA resin ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) was added to the sample , using a ratio of 1 mL resin per gram of membrane , and left to bind , stirring , for approximately 90 min . The resin was then packed into a glass econo-column ( BioRad , USA ) under gravity . The resin was washed with 20 column volumes ( CV ) of wash buffer ( 1x PBS , 20 mM imidazole ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 0 . 05% DDM ) . The resin was further washed with 10CV of wash buffer containing 30 mM imidazole . The bound GFP-SH1446 fusion protein was eluted with wash buffer containing 250 mM imidazole . The eluent was combined with an equivalent concentration of hexa histidine tagged TEV protease and dialysed overnight against 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 03% DDM . The cleaved protein was filtered using a 0 . 22 μm filter ( Millipore , USA ) and passed through a Ni-NTA 5 mL HisTrap column ( GE Healthcare ) to remove uncleaved GFP-SH1446 protein and TEV protease . The flow through was collected and concentrated to 300 μl using a 50 kDa MWCO concentrator ( Vivapsin 20 , Sartorius AG ) and applied to a size exclusion column ( Superdex 200 10/30 , GE Healthcare ) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 03% DDM . Fractions containing purified SH1446 protein were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 15–20 mg . ml−1 . For expression and purification of TnaA , overnight cultures were grown in LB at 37°C , 200 rpm . 1 L of LB was inoculated 1:50 with the starter culture and grown to an OD600nm ~0 . 6–0 . 8 , target protein expression was induced with 0 . 001% arabinose . Following induction the culture was further incubated at 37°C for ~8 hr . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 , 500 rpm for 15 min and resuspended in 35 mL resuspension buffer ( 50 mM Kpi , 20% Glycerol , 200 mM NaCl and 10 mL Imidazole , pH 7 . 8 ) and stored at −80°C . All subsequent steps were carried out at 4°C , for protein purification cells were thawed and lysed using sonication with 3 s pulsed and 7 s pause for 3mins . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation 25 , 000 rpm ~30 min . The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column ( GE Healthcare ) and affinity purified on an AKTA Start ( GE Healthcare ) using a standard protocol as per manufacturer’s instructions . Crystals of SH1446 were obtained in-meso phase . Briefly , concentrated protein was mixed with 9 . 9 monoacylglycerol ( Monoolein , Sigma-Aldrich ) at a protein:lipid ratio of 2:3 , in a mechanical syringe mixer at 20°C ( Ai and Caffrey , 2000 ) . 50 nL of mesophase and 800 nL of precipitant solution was dispensed on to a 96-well glass plate using an in meso robot ( Gryphon , Art Robbins Instruments ) . SH1446 S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH complex was crystallised in precipitant solution containing 26–27% ( v/v ) PEG 200 , 220 mM ( NH4 ) 2HPO4 , 110 mM sodium citrate ( pH 5 . 0 ) and 5 mM S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH ( Peakdale Molecular ) and left overnight at 4°C , prior to crystallisation . Crystals appeared after 2–3 days , and grew to its maximum size after 10 days . Crystallisation wells were accessed using a tungsten-carbide glasscutter , and crystals were directly mounted onto 50–100 μm microloops ( MiTeGen ) and flash frozen at 100 K . X-ray diffraction data were collected at ID23-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility on a Pilatus3 2M detector with an exposure setting of 0 . 05 s with a 0 . 2° oscillation range over 360° Diffraction data was indexed and integrated in XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) and merged in Aimless ( Evans , 2011 ) . The ligand bound complex was solved by molecular replacement in PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) using a modified search model of the bacterial peptide transporter from Streptococcus thermophilus , PepTSt ( Lyons et al . , 2014 ) , PDB: 4D2B . Iterative rounds of manual model building in COOT ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) followed by refinement in autoBUSTER ( Bricogne G . 2017 ) followed by refinement in Phenix ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) , resulted in a final model , which was validated using the Molprobity server ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Additional difference density was observed in the binding site and matched the stereo chemical properties and size of S-CG3M3SH . Ligand restraints were generated using the Grade Web Server ( http://grade . globalphasing . org ) . Figures were prepared using PyMOL ( Schrödinger , LLC ) . Purified SH1446 was detergent exchanged into n-Decyl-β-D-maltopyranoside ( DM , Anatrace ) using a size exclusion column ( Superdex 200 10/30 , GE Healthcare ) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 3% DM . Lipids ( POPE:POPG in a 3:1 ratio ) were mixed with the eluted protein at a ratio of 60:1 . The protein:lipid mixture was rapidly diluted with 50 mM KPO4 ( pH 7 . 0 ) buffer to below the CMC value of DM . Proteoliposomes were harvested by ultracentrifugation ( 234 , 000 xg ) for 120 min . The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM KPO4 and dialysed overnight against 3L of 50 mM KPO4 ( pH 7 . 0 ) . Proteoliposomes were recovered and subjected to three rounds of freeze thawing before storage at −80°C . Proteoliposomes were thawed and harvested by ultracentrifugation at 150 , 000 g . The resulting pellet was carefully resuspended in INSIDE buffer ( 120 mM KCl , 2 mM MgSO4 , 5 mM HEPES pH 6 . 8 ) and 1 mM pyranine ( trisodium 8-hydroxypyrene-1 , 3 , 6-trisulfonate ) . Proteoliposomes underwent eleven freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen before the sample was extruded through a 0 . 4 μm polycarbonate membrane and harvested by ultracentrifugation as before . Excess pyranine dye was removed with a Microspin G-25 column ( GE Healthcare ) pre-equilibrated with INSIDE buffer without pyranine . For the assay , proteoliposomes were diluted into OUTSIDE buffer ( 120 mM NaCl , 5 mM HEPES ( pH 6 . 8 ) , 2 mM MgSO4 ) . A Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer ( Agilent Technologies ) equipped with a cuvette and magnetic flea was used to carry out the transport assay . Dual fluorescence excitation was set to 460/415 nm with emission at 510 nm . Transport was initiated with 1 μM valinomycin , the resulting data was exported and analysed using Prism ( GraphPad Software ) . Transport data was normalised to one to facilitate comparison with data collected from multiple conditions . Proteoliposomes were harvested as before , the resulting pellet was resuspended in INSIDE buffer , subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen , extruded through a 0 . 4 μm polycarbonate membrane and harvested by ultracentrifugation once more . For the assay , proteoliposomes were diluted in external buffer ( 110 mM NaCl , 10 mM NaPO4 and 2 mM MgSO4 ) supplemented with 50 μM di-alanine peptide containing trace amounts of tritiated 3H-di-alanine ( specific activity 30 Ci/mmol ) and the competing substrate at increasing concentrations as indicated . Competition assays were performed at 30°C , samples were taken at specified time points and transport was stopped by addition of 2 mL H2O . Proteoliposomes were immediately filtered onto a 0 . 22 μm cellulose filter ( Merck Millipore ) using a vacuum manifold and subsequently washed twice more with 2 mL H2O . The amount of peptide transported into the liposomes was calculated based on the specific activity for each peptide as detailed by the manufacturer and counting efficiency for the radioisotope in Ultima Gold ( PerkinElmer ) counted in a Wallac scintillation counter ( 3H , 45% counting efficiency ) . Transport assays were performed a minimum of three times to generate an overall mean and S . E . M . Atomic coordinates for the atomic models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 6EXS .",
         "Human body odour contains a number of chemicals , but the most pungent and recognisable are thioalcohols . These molecules are created through a series of chemical reactions that start with an odourless precursor , a compound produced in glands located in our armpits . Then , a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus hominis takes in these molecules and transforms them into smelly thioalcohols . The precise details of how the bacteria do this are not clear . Now , Minhas , Bawdon et al . show how S . hominis uses a transport protein in its membrane to bring the odourless precursor inside . In the experiments , tools such as X-ray crystallography captured snapshots of this transporter as it was moving the compound into the bacteria . This helped to understand how the bacteria recognize these precursors , as well as the exact structure of these molecules and of their transporters . The experiments also reveal that bacteria which do not create odour can also ingest the precursors through this same process . This suggests that the odour production is a unique process that happens once these molecules are inside S . hominis . The findings imply that humans and their body odour-producing bacteria likely evolved together . In other mammals , the bacterial production of bodily smells is linked to the release of pheromones , which are chemicals involved in communication and in selecting sexual partners . It is not clear whether this is also true for humans . Ultimately , learning more about how S . hominis converts precursor molecules into thioalcohols could lead to new ways of nipping body odours in the bud .",

         "Here we report the structural and biochemical basis of bacterial transport of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH by Staphylococcus hominis , which is converted to the sulphurous thioalcohol component 3M3SH in the bacterial cytoplasm , before being released into the environment . Knowledge of the molecular basis of precursor transport , essential for body odour formation , provides a novel opportunity to design specific inhibitors of malodour production in humans . Esterified fatty acids and other lipids are secreted by the sebaceous gland , while the eccrine glands produce a dilute salt solution with lactate and other organic solutes being secreted  . In humans , the link between the axillary apocrine gland , underarm bacteria and body odour  , was first recognised over 50 years ago  and early culture-based studies on this relationship found the axillary microbiota to be dominated by Staphylococcus , Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium species , with the Corynebacteria in particular correlating with malodour intensity  . More recent culture-independent meta-taxonomic studies have confirmed that the axilla is dominated by these genera , although the presence of additional taxa not previously indicated by culture-based methods is also evident , notably Gram-positive anaerobic cocci  belonging to the Anaerococcus and Peptoniphilus genera  . Various molecules produced in the axilla have been linked to malodour , including 16-androstene steroids  and short-chain  volatile fatty acids  produced by axillary bacteria via several metabolic routes  . A third class of molecule , the thioalcohols  , have recently been identified as important components of human body odour and a number of these have been detected within the volatiles released from the underarm  . The glutathione conjugated form  has never been detected in axillary sweat; however , the L-cysteinylglycine dipeptide conjugated form , S--L-cysteinylglycine   , is readily detectable  and recently a γ-glutamyl transferase  has been demonstrated to localise to the apocrine sweat gland and convert SG-3M3SH to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH   . We and others have demonstrated that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH can be taken up and metabolised by a highly limited range of staphylococcal species present in the axilla , namely Staphylococcus hominis , Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylocooccus lugdunensis , to liberate 3M3SH , that subsequently exits the cell through an undefined mechanism  . hominis and body odour production has recently been established using culture-independent taxonomic studies of the axillary microbiota  , confirming the biological significance of this low-abundance species within the axilla in BO production in humans . Through a combination of structural , biochemical and cell based assays we reveal how this peptide transporter is able to recognise a thioalcohol-conjugated peptide and further , show that transport is coupled to the inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient . Our results suggest that SH1446 is a clear target for inhibitor design to prevent malodour production , thus providing further molecular insights into the role of the skin microbiota in human scent generation . Resting cells of E . coli were indeed able to remove S-benzyl-L-cysteinylglycine from solution and break it down to release the thiol active product , benzyl mercaptan  . Following transport into the cell , the dipeptide must be cleaved to release the benzyl mercaptan , most likely through a cysteine-S-conjugate β-lyase-type activity , for which a number have been described in E . coli the main peptide systems are relatively well characterised , the two main transport systems belong to the ATP binding cassette  family and the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter  family  . coli BW25113 strain with non-functional Opp and Dpp system  , was used to assess the role of these transporters in the production of benzyl mercaptan . These were the four members of the proton dependent oligopeptide transporter , or POT family , encoded by dtpA-D , that have poorly defined physiological roles during growth on peptides  , the CstA protein , orthologues of which have been demonstrated to be peptide transporters  and the Sap system , which is implicated in uptake of cationic antimicrobial peptides  . Most of these strains had similar levels of benzyl mercaptan production to the wild-type , with the exception of dtpB which had an overall 50% drop in thiol production  . These data suggest that transporters belonging to the POT family are most likely responsible for Cys-Gly-conjugate transport , revealing a new biological role for bacterial POT transporters in the uptake of Cys-Gly-  conjugates . The four dtp genes were cloned into a pBAD vector commonly used for overexpression of membrane transporters  and transformed into the wild-type E . The same pattern was observed with S-benzyl-Cys-Gly as a substrate  , suggesting that DtpB has a unique ability to transport these unusual conjugated peptides . The molecular basis for S-Cys-Gly-3M3H transport into malodour producing staphylococci is unknown , and the genetic intractability of these poorly studied coagulase negative Staphylococcal species makes it difficult to study using genetic approaches . We therefore used an alternative approach exploiting our discovery that expression of a transporter in trans could produce a BO+ phenotype to E . coli POT family peptide transporters can transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , we examined the genome of S . hominis contains only a single POT family member DtpT  , orthologues of which were seen in all sequenced staphylococci  . The POT peptide systems remain largely uncharacterised in staphyoloccci , although in the well-studied pathogen S . haemolyticus , two known thioalcohol producers , and which is genetically linked to genes involved in peptide and amino acid metabolism  . In contrast , with S-benzyl-cysteinlyglycine as a substrate , there was no increase in production of benzyl mercaptan with SH1446 but a significant increase was observed with SH0415  . Together these data strongly support the conclusion that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH transporter in S . Firstly , we used our E . coli system where 3M3SH production is seen when SH1446 is expressed in trans and we observed clear inhibition of 3M3SH production with both di- and tri-Ala peptides  but not with L-Ala alone nor tetra-Ala . The purified TnaA enzyme that cleaves Cys-3M3SH was not inhibited by any of these peptides  , supporting the hypothesis that the whole cell inhibition is due to inhibition of peptide transport . Similarly , we measured the ability of the same peptides to inhibit 3M3SH production directly in S . hominis wild-type , however this affect is due to the acidic pH that was required to dissolve the peptide which appears to inhibit metabolism in S . POT transporters belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily  and use an inwardly directed proton electrochemical gradient to drive the concentrative uptake of di- and tri-peptides across the cell membrane for metabolic assimilation  . To establish SH1446 as the protein responsible for S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH recognition and transport , the gene was cloned and overexpressed in E . Transport was studied using a previously employed pyranine based reporter assay , which measures transport via changes to the internal pH of the liposomes   . To understand the recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH compared to natural peptides , we determined IC50 values using competition with 3H-di-alanine . Our data therefore show that while PepTSh can transport the modified peptide , the addition of the thioalcohol group on the cysteine side chain has substantially impaired the recognition and transport versus natural peptides . 5 Å resolution , bound to S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH using the in meso crystallisation method  . PepTSh adopts the canonical MFS fold with helices H1-H6 forming the N-terminal bundle and H7-H12 the C-terminal bundle . PepTSh was crystallised in an inward open state , observed previously for other members of the POT family  , wherein the extracellular gate , consisting of helices H1-2 and H7-8 from the N- and C-terminal bundles respectively , is closed and the intracellular gate , consisting of helices H4-5 and H10-11 is open . Similar to other bacterial POT family members , PepTSh contains two additional helices inserted between the N- and C-terminal bundles , termed HA and HB  . Unlike previous POT structures however , PepTSh also contains a well-structured β-hairpin motif between helices H7 and H8 on the extracellular side of the membrane , extending out in line with the lipid head groups . Interestingly we observed a number of monoolein lipid molecules that cluster around both the β- hairpin and the cavity created between helices HA and HB with the transporter domain . The role of helices HA and HB in prokaryotic POT family transporters still remains unclear . However , the observation of lipid molecules bound between these helices and the transport domain suggests a possible role in stabilising these transporters in the membrane , which may be an adaption specific to prokaryotic members of the POT family  . The terminal carboxyl group makes two hydrogen bond interactions , one with Tyr41 on H1 and a second interaction to a water molecule  , which links the carboxyl group with Asn347 on H8 . The carbonyl group of the CG peptide also makes a hydrogen bond to this water molecule , creating a well-coordinated interaction network between the peptide and Asn347  . The terminal amino group makes two further polar interactions , with a water molecule that sits next to Tyr41 and also to the carbonyl group of Gln344 , which sits further up on H8 . In contrast , the thioalcohol moiety points towards the extracellular gate , with the sulphur atom sitting close to Gln310 on H7 , whereas the alcohol group extends towards helix H8 making interactions with backbone carbonyl and amide groups of Phe343 and Asn347 , respectively . Previously , we showed that a related POT family transporter , PepTSt , is able to bind peptides in different orientations in the binding site , with a di-peptide adopting a horizontal position and a tri-peptide a vertical one  and suggested this flexibility may be responsible for the accomodation of larger peptide ligands  . Here we see that the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide adopts a more vertical orientation , similar to the tri-alanine position in PepTSt . A structural overlay of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide shows that it sits much further up in the binding site compared to the natural peptides captured in PepTSt  , most likely as a result of the requirement to accommodate the thioalcohol group in the extended pocket . In PepTSt , the amino terminal group of the di-peptide directly interacts with helix H8 and H10 , whereas the tri-peptide makes a much weaker interaction through a carbonyl group . The role of water in mediating interactions between peptides and their binding sites has been previously observed in the ABC transporter binding domains  , albeit for side chain independent binding . A similar mechanism may be employed by PepTSh to facilitate transport of modified peptides by replacing direct interactions between the peptide and the transporter when these are sterically restricted , as we observe with S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The interaction of the amino termini of peptides with both the mammalian and bacterial POT family transporters has been identified as facilitating high affinity binding  . The reduced IC50 value for the modified peptide in PepTSh  , may therefore be a combination of steric restraints resulting in the accommodation of the extended side chain group , and the subsequent knock on effects on the position of the interactions between the amino and carboxy groups with conserved side chains in the binding site . S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is the first human derived peptide with a modified side chain to be captured in a POT family transporter , and contains biochemical features similar to physiological peptides  , but also incorporates the non-peptide thioalcohol group  . We therefore wished to explore whether S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is recognised using a similar mechanism to physiological peptides . Several mutations in the binding site that have previously been shown to play an important role in peptide recognition within the bacterial POT family were therefore generated  . Tyrosine 41 forms part of a conserved E33xxERFxYY41 motif on TM1  , which plays a role in proton coupling and influences peptide uptake in several POT family members  . A similar negative effect on transport was observed in the related POT family transporter PepTSt , from Streptococcus thermophilus  , suggesting a common role for the conserved tyrosine in peptide recognition within the POT family . We then used the same variants in our whole cell assay for 3M3SH production . Interestingly , while both Tyr41Phe and Tyr41Ala variants had reduced activity , at about 50% of the wild-type protein  , the phenotype was not as severe as that observed in the liposome based assay . We interpret this result to indicate that recognition of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is less dependent on this residue than di-Ala . This may reflect the requirement of Asn347 to coordinate the water molecule linking the peptide to the intracellular gate side chain Glu418 , which in the case of the di-peptide may interact directly as in PepTSt , lessening the requirement for the Asn347 interaction . Uptake was noticeably reduced , but still measurable at ~19% compared to WT  . The same mutation resulted in a similar large decrease in the biotransformation of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH , while a Tyr411Ala mutation had wild-type biotransformation rates  . It is clear that the hydrophobic pocket in PepTSh plays an important role in facilitating the recognition of the thioalcohol group in the binding pocket and , as discussed below , is a potential site for inhibitor design . Taken together the current data lend further support to our model of an adaptable binding site within the POT family that can accommodate chemically diverse peptides and their derivatives through the use of both side chain and water mediated interactions with conserved residues and different specificity pockets to accommodate the different chemical side chains . Evidence for the microbial origins of chemical signalling molecules is also seen in other animals such as foxes , deer , cats and beetles  , but the details of this process in humans is less well understood . heamolyticus are able to produce 3M3SH prompted the search for the molecular basis for this process  . While S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is a highly modified and uniquely human dipeptide , we reasoned that this moiety might dictate the uptake mechanism into malodour producing bacteria and here we identify a peptide transporter , PepTSh  , from the POT family of secondary active transporters as being responsible for this process . hominis dictated that we use a biochemical approach to demonstrate that SH1446 is likely the sole route of uptake of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH . The use of L-Ala containing peptides as inhibitors in this study demonstrates an inhibitory effect on 3M3SH production that is consistent with the properties of a POT family transporter . hominis , using tools developed for S . Given that S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is effectively a dipeptide with a highly extended R-group on the first amino acid , it is noteworthy that only the promiscuous nature of the POT binding site is able to recognise this ligand . For OppA and DppA , the substrate binding proteins that initially recognise peptides transported by the ABC systems , the binding pocket is well defined and makes general main chain-main chain interactions to ensure that the protein can bind peptides in a sequence independent manner  . Recently , the human POT family transporters , PepT1 and PepT2 , have gained additional attention due to their role in the absorption and retention of several important classes of drug molecule  , including peptide modified pro-drugs . Pro-drugs are able to compete with natural peptides for transport via PepT1 and PepT2 , and are therefore actively transported into the body  . The promiscuous nature of the POT family binding site has been shown to derive , in part , from their ability to recognise peptides in different conformations and through the availability of different specificity pockets , which are able to accommodate chemically different classes of peptides  . Our results here provide the first evidence that specificity pockets can also accommodate exotic chemical extensions . The observation that water plays a role in facilitating the interaction between the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH peptide and PepTSh may also indicate a broader role for water in facilitating the recognition of xenobiotic peptides . In particular , the observation that water may bridge interactions between the binding site and either the amino or carboxy group of the ligand would greatly increase the number of conformations a peptide could adopt in the transporter and still trigger proton coupled transport . Finally , we can ask the questions , why do these bacteria transport S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH and can this process be inhibited to provide effective malodour control ? The presumed biochemical pathway for breakdown of the S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH is outlined in Figure 6 . The route of export of 3M3SH is unknown , but currently assumed to be diffusion across the bacterial inner membrane . The bacterium will gain a nutritional benefit from the catabolism of S-Cys-Gly-3M3SH via the release of both nitrogen and carbon as glycine , pyruvate and ammonia  , which may have been the evolutionary trigger for the adaptation to catabolise this chemical .

         "Monocytes are phagocytic effector cells in the blood and precursors of resident and inflammatory tissue macrophages . The aim of the current study was to analyse and compare their contribution to innate immune surveillance of the lung in the steady state with macrophage and dendritic cells ( DC ) . ECFP and EGFP transgenic reporters based upon Csf1r and Cx3cr1 distinguish monocytes from resident mononuclear phagocytes . We used these transgenes to study the migratory properties of monocytes and macrophages by functional imaging on explanted lungs . Migratory monocytes were found to be either patrolling within large vessels of the lung or locating at the interface between lung capillaries and alveoli . This spatial organisation gives to monocytes the property to capture fluorescent particles derived from both vascular and airway routes . We conclude that monocytes participate in steady-state surveillance of the lung , in a way that is complementary to resident macrophages and DC , without differentiating into macrophages .\nThe mononuclear phagocytic system ( MPS ) consists of a family of cells—including monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells ( DC ) —that are derived from common committed bone marrow progenitors and perform related functions ( Hume , 2006; Hashimoto et al . , 2011 ) . The lung is a mucosal surface of the body , exposed constantly to inhaled particles including pathogens , as well as other potential toxins ( Nelson et al . , 2012 ) . Lung mononuclear phagocytes have been shown to adapt specifically to the lung environment , and contribute to lung homeostasis , scavenging , and immune surveillance ( Kopf et al . , 2014; The lungs at the frontlines of immunity , 2014 ) . Monocytes were originally considered to be circulating precursors of macrophages , participating in renewal of tissue-resident macrophages in steady state and recruited in large numbers in response to inflammatory stimuli ( Auffray et al . , 2009; Geissmann et al . , 2010 ) . Fate mapping approaches and parabiosis experiments have been used to argue that tissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar macrophages ( AM ) may be seeded from the yolk sac or foetal liver during embryonic development and can be maintained in the absence of monocyte recruitment ( Guilliams et al . , 2013; Hashimoto et al . , 2013; Yona et al . , 2013 ) . However , others have suggested the models used in these studies may disturb the availability of the key growth factor , CSF1 , and do not necessarily reflect the steady state ( Jenkins and Hume , 2014 ) . Whatever their normal contribution to the resident macrophage pool , monocytes derived from the bone marrow ( Chow et al . , 2011 ) and spleen ( Swirski et al . , 2009 ) can clearly replenish tissue macrophages after their cytotoxic depletion . Beyond this precursor role , monocytes carry out specific effector functions during infection ( Serbina et al . , 2008 ) and may be involved in steady-state tissue surveillance by capturing and transporting antigen from tissue to lymphoid organs ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) . Macrophages isolated from different organs have distinct expression profiles which can be distinguished further if the cells are separated according to their surface markers ( Gautier et al . , 2013 ) . Unfortunately , no available surface marker is well correlated with any other marker , at either the protein or mRNA level ( Hume , 2008 , 2012; Hume et al . , 2010 ) , so the number of macrophage subsets definable by flow cytometry is essentially infinite ( Becher et al . , 2014 ) . Peripheral blood monocytes , on the other hand , can be subdivided into two broad functional classes . In the mouse , one subset called classical monocytes , expresses high levels of both Ly6C and the chemokine receptor CCR2 but a low level of the fractalkine ( CX3CL1 ) receptor CX3CR1 , while the second , the so-called non-classical monocytes , lacks Ly6C but expresses a high level of CX3CR1 ( Geissmann et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast to what we know about tissue macrophages , very little information is available on how monocytes behave after entering tissues . Myeloid-restricted fluorescent reporter genes based upon various lineage-restricted genes have been used in live imaging and functional genomics ( Hume , 2011 ) . A Csf1r-EGFP reporter gene serves as a definitive marker of MPS cells ( Sasmono et al . , 2003 ) , while a Cx3cr1-EGFP reporter labels the non-classical monocytes as well as subsets of tissue macrophages , including microglia , as well as a subset of natural killer ( NK ) lymphocytes ( Jung et al . , 2000 ) . The Itgax-YFP transgenic mouse was considered to provide a marker for classical ‘dendritic cells’ ( Lindquist et al . , 2004 ) and has been used to image so-called interstitial DC in the lung ( Looney et al . , 2011; Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . However , this reporter is rather uniformly expressed in tissue macrophages associated with mucosa and in the lung provides a generic MPS marker ( Hume , 2008 , 2012 ) . The deletion of a conserved distal element of the Csf1r promoter in the Csf1r-ECFPtg/+ mouse ( MacBlue ) ablates expression of a reporter gene in trophoblasts , osteoclasts , granulocytes , and many tissue macrophages ( Ovchinnikov et al . , 2008 ) . This deleted promoter was used to construct an amplified binary transgene in which Csf1r promoter elements direct the expression of gal4-VP16 , which in turn activates expression of a UAS-ECFP transgene . All blood monocytes in these MacBlue mice are strongly ECFP+ , whereas most tissue macrophages do not express the reporter protein ( Sauter et al . , 2014 ) . In the current study , we combined the myeloid-specific fluorescent reporters from MacBlue mice with either Cx3cr1gfp/+ or Itgax-YFP transgenic mice to support in situ imaging of lung monocyte cell trafficking and compare their phagocytic activity with that of resident mononuclear phagocytes .\nThe MacBlue binary transgene ( Csf1r-gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP ) provides a unique marker of blood monocytes ( Jenkins and Hume , 2014 ) . To confirm this restricted expression in the lung , we generated MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ double transgenic mice . Two-photon laser scanning microscopy 3D-reconstruction of fresh explanted lung and histological section of cryo-preserved lungs from these mice identified distinct subsets with distinct morphologies and distributions within the organ ( Figure 1 ) . Stellar EGFP+ECFPneg cells were seen in the collagen membrane surrounding the lung pleura ( Figure 1A , B , green squares ) , deeper in the lung parenchyma with small round shapes or stellar shapes ( Figure 1B , green squares ) , and along the basal membranes of bronchial airways ( Figure 1C , green squares ) . The luminal side of airways and alveoli contained large round ECFP+ cells , likely AM ( Figure 1A–D , pink squares ) . Smaller amoeboid-like ECFP+ cells were located in the interstitial space of the lung parenchyma ( Figure 1A–D , purple squares ) . In overview , the pattern was consistent with previous evidence that the MacBlue ECFP transgene was expressed only in AM and monocyte-like cells , whereas most interstitial CX3CR1-EGFP expressing cells lacked expression . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 003 To establish the relationship between the cells that could be imaged in situ and their cellular phenotypes in MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice , we applied a panel of phenotypic markers including CD11b , CD115 , Ly6C , Ly6G , F4/80 , CD64 , CD11c , IAb , CD62L , NK1 . 1 , and SiglecF to discriminate four different subsets of the lung based on their EGFP/ECFP signature in the double transgenic line ( Figure 2A ) and compared them to blood populations ( Figure 2B and Table 1 ) . The lungs contained two ECFPbright populations , either EGFPbright or EGFPdim ( Figure 2A , purple gate ) resembling those observed in the blood ( Figure 2B ) . The CX3CR1-EGFPlow population was Ly6ChighCD11b+Ly6GnegF4/80intNK1 . 1negCD64+ ( blue gate ) in both the blood and the lungs ( Table 1 ) , consistent with identity as ‘classical’ Ly6Chigh monocytes ( Ly6Chigh Mo ) . The CX3CR1-EGFPhigh population was Ly6ClowCD11b+Ly6GnegF4/80intNK1 . 1negCD64+CD11c+ phenotype ( red gate ) , consistent with the phenotype of the Ly6Clow monocyte subset ( Ly6Clow Mo ) ( Guilliams et al . , 2014 ) . For both subsets , the expression of CD115 and CD62L was down modulated in the lung cells compared to their circulating counterparts . Downregulation of surface CSF1R ( CD115 ) could reflect the down-modulation of the surface receptor both by its ligand and by the many inflammatory stimuli present in the lung ( Sester et al . , 1999 ) . As expected , the lung also contained an ECFPhighEGFPneg signature ( pink gate ) . These cells were larger than monocytes and CD11b+Ly6CnegLy6GnegF4/80highNK1 . 1negCD11chighCD64highSiglecFhigh cells , consistent with their identity as AM . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 004Figure 2 .

AM , alveolar macrophages; NK , natural killer . The EGFPbright cells that lacked detectable ECFP ( green gate ) were a heterogeneous population . A subset of these cells in the lung labelled with NK1 . 1 , but many were CD64+F4/80+ ( Figure 2A and Table 1 ) interstitial and pleural macrophages , as observed on histological reconstruction ( Figure 1A ) . In the blood , the majority of ECFPnegEGFPbright cells labelled with NK1 . 1 ( Figure 2B ) , but the population also included immature myeloid cells as previously reported ( Sauter et al . , 2014 ) . Note that the ECFP transgene is expressed at low but detectable levels on granulocytes in the blood ( cyan gate ) ; these cells were positive for Ly6G ( Figure 2B , C ) . In summary , the binary expression of the two transgenic reporters in MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice permits the identification of monocytes in tissues , and their distinction from other mononuclear phagocyte subsets as well as from NK cells . In order to confirm the monocyte origin of the ECFP+EGFPlow/high -Ly6Chigh and -Ly6Clow monocytes , we generated parabionts of the double transgenic MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ with C57Bl6 mice and analysed the reconstitution after 1 month of parabiosis . In the lung , donor-derived ECFP cells displayed Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte phenotypes ( Figure 3A ) , were small in size , with ameboid-like morphologies , and were all located in the interalveolar space ( Figure 3B ) . By contrast , neither AM nor interstitial macrophages were derived from the donor as there was no expression of the transgenes in these compartments ( Figure 3B ) . The only cells expressing EGFP but not ECFP , were NK cells derived from the donor ( Figure 3A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 006Figure 3 . Interstitial ECFP+ cells are monocyte-derived .

Up to six parabionts were prepared independently . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 006 To evaluate the function of chemotactic signals in the lung , we compared the frequency of the different subsets defined above in Ccr2−/− , Cx3cr1−/− , and Ccr2−/−Cx3cr1−/− ( dKO ) mice in the blood and the lung ( Figure 4 ) . Consistent with published studies ( Kim et al . , 2011; Yona et al . , 2013 ) , the frequency of circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes was similar in wild-type ( WT ) and Cx3cr1−/− mice . By contrast , the absence of CX3CR1 did impact on the yield of Ly6Chigh cells in the lung . As expected , this subset was strongly reduced in Ccr2−/− mice and dKO mice in both the blood and the lungs ( Figure 4B , C ) . Ly6Clow monocyte frequency was similar in Ccr2−/− mice but significantly reduced in Cx3cr1−/− and dKO mice in both the blood and the lungs compared to WT mice ( Figure 4B , C ) . AM frequencies were similar in all strains ( Figure 4C ) consistent with their reported monocyte-independent homeostasis ( Guilliams et al . , 2013 ) . Together , these results showed that CCR2 and CX3CR1 control the steady-state trafficking and survival of both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte-derived cells in the lungs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 007Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 007 Having demonstrated the utility of the MacBlue marker to define monocyte-derived cells , we performed live imaging on explanted lungs to characterize the behaviour of these cells ( Figure 5A and Video 1 ) . Small interstitial ECFP+ cells ( area 61 ± 17 μm² ) with an amoeboid-like shape displayed a bimodal behaviour: they were either highly motile , going backwards and forwards between the alveoli , or relatively sessile with protrusions extending towards the lumen of the alveoli ( Figure 5B–C and Videos 1 and 2 ) . Based upon these distinct behaviours , we defined ‘patrolling’ cells with high velocity ( 10 ± 4 . 6 μm/min ) and a low arrest coefficient ( 14 ± 13% ) and interstitial ECFP+ cells with lower velocity ( 4 ± 2 . 2 μm/min ) and a higher arrest coefficient ( 64 ± 21% ) ( Figure 5C ) . Intravenous injection of rhodamine dextran prior to mouse sacrifice permitted , during a short time frame before vascular leakage , to determine that fast moving patrolling ECFP+ cells were located inside large vessels , whereas slow motile ECFP+ cells appeared to be extravascular but in close contact with the vasculature ( Video 3 ) . Aside from monocytes , large round ECFPbright AM ( area 121 ± 23 μm² ) were detected in the alveolar lumina , leisurely surveying the surface of the airways with a velocity of 2 ± 1 . 5 μm/min and a high arrest coefficient ( 76 ± 19% ) ( Video 4 ) . Interstitial EGFP+ cells also migrated slowly , with comparable velocity and arrest coefficient to AM ( Figure 5C ) . To determine their motility coefficient ( MC ) , we plotted the mean square displacement as a function of the square root of time . The MC of patrolling monocytes was 30-fold higher than the MC of interstitial ECFP+ cells ( 39 vs 1 . 3 μm²/min ) and a further fourfold higher than the MC of AM ( 0 . 3 μm²/min ) ( Figure 5D ) . This higher MC in interstitial ECFP+ monocytes was attributable to the protrusive activity and slow displacement suggesting scanning of the interalveolar space ( Video 2 ) . Time lapse imaging of explanted non-transgenic lungs from parabiont mice showed similar scanning behaviour ( Videos 5 and 6 ) , supporting the monocyte origin of these cells . In overview , while AM survey the luminal side of the alveoli , interstitial monocyte-derived cells survey the lung tissue through either active patrolling in the vasculature or protrusive activity toward the alveolar space . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 008Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 014 In order to determine the molecular mechanism involved in the steady-state lung surveillance , we analysed the behaviour of lung mononuclear phagocytes in MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/gfp mice ( Figure 6A and Video 7 ) . The absence of functional CX3CR1 did not change the arrest coefficient ( Figure 6B ) but did slightly reduce the MC of patrolling cells ( Figure 6C ) . As might be anticipated given their lack of CX3CR1 expression , AM behaviour was also comparable in WT and Cx3cr1−/− mice ( Figure 6B–C ) . On the other hand , deletion of the CX3CR1 clearly altered the behaviour of the interstitial ECFP+ cells , which showed a greatly increased arrest coefficient and reduced MC ( Figure 6B–C ) . The scanning behaviour was also strongly affected . In the absence of CX3CR1 , the remaining interstitial ECFP+ cells present had greatly reduced protrusive activity , as indicated by increased global ‘sphericity’ ( Figure 6D , E ) and reduced sphericity variation ( Figure 6F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 015Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 016 Lung DC defined by CD11c expression have been previously shown to participate in antigen uptake ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . CD11c is expressed on all tissue macrophages in the lung , but is absent from monocytes . To compare the roles of these cells in particle clearance , we combined MacBlue with the Itgax-YFP transgene ( MacBlue×Itgax-YFP ) and again compared the fluorescent signatures of different mononuclear phagocyte populations ( Figure 7A ) . According to previous phenotyping , Ly6Chigh monocytes were CD11b+Ly6G−SiglecF-IAblowCD64lowLy6Chigh , Ly6Clow monocytes were CD11b+Ly6G−SiglecF-IAblowCD64lowLy6Clow , interstitial macrophages were CD11b+Ly6G−SiglecF-IAbhighCD64+ , and AM were CD11blowCD11chighSiglecFhighCD64+ . Based upon published markers ( Guilliams et al . , 2014 ) , two sets of classical myeloid DC have been defined: CD11b+ DC that were CD11b+CD11c+Ly6G−SiglecF-IAbhighCD64−CD24+ and CD11b− DC that were CD11b−CD11c+Ly6G−SiglecF-IAbhighCD64−CD24+CD103+ ( Figure 7A ) . We determined the mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) of EGFP , ECFP , and YFP reporters from the MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ and MacBlue×Itgax-YFP in these subsets ( Figure 7B ) . EGFP and ECFP fluorescent reporter expressions were mainly restricted to lung macrophage and monocyte subsets as previously described ( Figure 2 ) . Although CD11c mRNA and surface protein are expressed widely among tissue macrophages in the lung , YFP expression was mainly restricted to the defined classical DC subsets with a brighter expression for CD11b− DC ( Figure 7C ) . Interestingly , AM only express the MacBlue transgene and despite expression of CD11c protein on their surface , YFP was detectable in only a small subset ( Figure 7B–C ) . Thus the combination of these different transgenes permits the distinction of lung mononuclear phagocytes and lung DC . AM represented the most abundant mononuclear phagocyte subset of the lung ( Figure 7D ) . Lung monocytes represented the second main mononuclear phagocyte subset and were even more numerous than interstitial macrophages , CD11b+ DC and CD11b−CD103+ DC ( Figure 7D ) . Histological analysis of a lung section of MacBlue×Itgax-YFP showed that YFPbright cells were mainly located along bronchial airways and poorly distributed in the alveolar space in contrast to ECFP+ monocytes and AM ( Figure 7E ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 017 Particle size and the physical properties of inhaled particles are critical in the uptake by lung phagocytes and trafficking to regional lymph nodes ( Jakubzick et al . , 2008; Blank et al . , 2013 ) . We hypothesized that regional segregation of monocytes and classical DC could be also important in antigen uptake . We inoculated mice with fluorescent beads either by intravenous or airway routes and compared the proportion of phagocytic cells in different lung subsets 4 hr after bead inoculation ( Figure 8A ) . After i . v . inoculation , only monocytic cells appeared to have taken up particles ( Figure 8B–C ) . After airway inhalation , AM were the main phagocytic subset ( Figure 8B–C ) , but particles were also detected among interstitial cells . The numbers of phagocytic Ly6Clow and Ly6Chigh monocytes were significantly higher compared to the number of phagocytic DC after airway inhalation , showing that lung monocytes are the only subsets that effectively capture both blood-derived and airway-derived fluorescent particles ( Figure 8C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 018Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 018 In order to further discriminate lung monocytes from circulating monocytes , we performed blood/tissue partitioning using in vivo CD45 labelling as reported by others ( Anderson et al . , 2014; Girgis et al . , 2014 ) . This approach was reported to be technically challenging due to the vascular permeability of the lung ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) . Lung mononuclear phagocyte subsets and neutrophils were labelled in different proportions ( Figure 9A ) . AM were not labelled , confirming that the antibody did not reach the airways . Overall , 27% of interstitial macrophages , 12% of CD11b+ DC , and only 1% of CD11b− DC were labelled , suggesting a distinct location of these subsets related to the vasculature ( Figure 9A ) . Up to 90% of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow lung monocytes were labelled by the anti-CD45 antibody in vivo; however , the MFI was significantly lower compared to that of blood monocytes ( Figure 9B ) . We excluded that this effect was due to collagen treatment , as similar results were obtained in non-digested lungs ( Figure 9B ) . Furthermore , the phenotype of both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes was slightly distinct from their circulating counterparts . Indeed lung monocytes displayed reduced expression of Ly6C , CD62L , and CD115 as previously observed , in addition to a higher level of CD11b , whereas only Ly6Clow monocytes displayed higher CD11c expression ( Figure 9C ) . The same differences were observed in monocytes isolated from lung without enzymatic digestion ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that monocytes can be either extravascular but in close vicinity to the vessels or still intravascular and trapped in capillaries with reduced access to the bloodstream and submitted to the lung environment . MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice were inoculated intravenously 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 µm and 0 . 2 µm red fluorescent beads to differentiate large vessel areas identified by the presence of both 10 µm and 0 . 2 µm beads , and lung capillary areas identified by only 0 . 2 µm beads ( Figure 9D ) . In large vessels , ECFP+ cells were mainly round shaped , whereas in the vicinity of capillaries , interstitial ECFP+ cells displayed an elongated or amoeboid-like shape ( Figure 9D ) . Confocal analysis of the microvascular area using CD31 staining showed that interstitial ECFP+ cells locate at the interface between the capillaries and the alveoli either intra- or extravascularly ( Figure 9E and Video 8 ) . To confirm that this positioning allows the sampling of particles inoculated by the airways route , we performed in vivo CD45 staining of monocytes that had captured beads 4 hr after intranasal inoculation ( Figure 9F ) . CD45 in vivo labelling was exactly the same for both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes that had captured the beads compared to non-phagocytic monocytes ( Figure 9F ) . This result confirmed that lung monocytes are strategically positioned at the interface between the bloodstream and airways to survey both compartments . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07847 . 019Figure 9 .

How this property differs from the already known functions of AM and DC was still unknown . Fluorescent myeloid-specific reporter transgenic mice have been widely used to study the behaviour of myeloid cells in vivo , although no transgenic reporter is restricted to a particular myeloid lineage ( Hume , 2011 ) . LysM reporters can be used to track either neutrophils or monocytes ( Faust et al . , 2000 ) . A wide diversity of cell subsets are labelled in the Cx3cr1gfp/+ system , including NK cells , which can be excluded only with a specific γc-deficient background ( Auffray et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly , the MacGreen ( Csf1r-EGFP ) transgene enables labelling of a wide range of mononuclear phagocytes as well as granulocytes ( Sasmono et al . , 2003 ) . The MacBlue binary transgene , based upon a deleted Csf1r promoter , produced a transgenic line in which the reporter gene is extinguished in the majority of mature tissue macrophages and greatly reduced in granulocytes ( Ovchinnikov et al . , 2008; Sauter et al . , 2014 ) . Despite the fact that ECFP expression is not directly related to the level of Csf1r mRNA , it provides a unique marker of cells that have recently derived from monocytes . In the current study , we intercrossed Cx3cr1gfp/+ and MacBlue mice to obtain an additional dimension of resolution and specificity . Monocytes were easily distinguishable from other subsets due to their common expression of ECFP . The differential expression of EGFP enabled a further distinction between Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes . Although our imaging approach did not allow us to distinguish between the two monocyte subsets , the shape , size , tissue localization , and behaviour of the ECFP+ cells provided a unique opportunity to track lung tissue mononuclear phagocytes and to compare their migratory patterns . The dual reporter also avoids potential artefacts created by the γc-deficient background excluding NK cells which we have shown to be highly represented in the CX3CR1-GFP+ fraction within the lungs . The combination of CCR2 and CX3CR1 deficient mice and parabionts permitted a more precise characterization of the nature and origin of the different subsets and confirmed that interstitial ECFP+ were monocyte-derived according to the proposed unified nomenclature ( Guilliams et al . , 2014 ) . Krummel’s group previously performed functional imaging of lung DC using the Itgax-YFP reporter ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . The combination of this reporter with the MacBlue mouse confirmed that interstitial monocyte-derived cells were distinct from lung DC . Histological analysis showed that monocyte-derived cells and DC share the surveillance activity through distinct regional distribution , the former located in the alveolar space at the interface with the bloodstream and the latter near larger bronchial airways . In vivo CD45 labelling added a new dimension of regional segregation between AM , interstitial macrophages , CD11b+ DC , CD11b− DC , and lung monocytes . This specific regional segregation at steady state is likely the result of the rapid circulation of monocytes that arrest constitutively in the capillaries of the alveolar space with relatively short life span ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) , whereas DC are slow motile cells ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . Of course regional segregation is likely less marked in the allergic asthma model for which important DC recruitment was observed in the vicinity of the alveoli , likely originating from monocytes ( Jakubzick et al . , 2008 ) , where they exert longer transepithelial dendrites formation toward airways ( Thornton et al . , 2012 ) . Our data demonstrate that the interstitial space of the lung is intensively surveyed by monocytes actively migrating or extending processes . The strategic positioning of lung monocytes at the interface allows for efficient capture of both blood and airway-derived particles . Four hours after intranasal inoculation , fluorescent particles remained undetectable in the mediastinal lymph nodes , as previously observed ( Jakubzick et al . , 2008; data not shown ) , however after 1 d , DC seem to prevail over monocytes in the transport of the inhaled particles . This suggests that the majority of monocytes may scavenge particles to clean up the tissue and filter the blood , whereas the majority of DC aim to transport antigen to the draining lymph node . Due to the vascular permeability of the lung , it is challenging to address the blood/tissue partitioning of the subsets ( Jakubzick et al . , 2013 ) . We combined in vivo CD45 labelling and confocal imaging to determine the precise location of lung monocytes ( Anderson et al . , 2014; Girgis et al . , 2014 ) . We determined that lung permeability does not allow it to be definitely concluded that lung monocytes share their time either intra- or extravascularly or even both . However , we showed that lung monocytes have a slightly differentiated phenotype compared to the circulating monocytes with a downregulation of CD115 and CD62L and an upregulation of CD11b and CD11c . Secondly , the proportions of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes were different in the lungs compared to the blood . Finally , monocyte localization in the vicinity of the bloodstream allows them to capture beads inoculated via the intranasal route . Several studies used in situ imaging of the lung ( Kreisel et al . , 2010; Looney et al . , 2011 ) , but it is likely that working on lung explants may somehow affect the dynamics of the studied cells . For instance , fast circulating monocytes in the blood flow could not be observed . Nevertheless , we still observed high velocity patrolling cells that were present within large vessels , suggesting that this migration is independent of the blood flow . This approach provides at least the advantage of better stability without breathing constraints and avoids any accumulation of inflammatory monocytes due to inflammation . Other monocyte behaviour might be observed using in vivo imaging . By contrast to the CX3CR1-dependence of endothelium patrolling ( Auffray et al . , 2007 ) as well as transepithelial dendrite formation in the gut ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , the patrolling activity of interstitial monocytes in the lung was unaffected by the absence of this receptor , whereas their scanning activity was severely impaired . Kim et al . showed that CX3CL1 was expressed by the epithelial cells of bronchioles and in the alveolar space using the CX3CL1-RFP reporters ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) , arguing in favour of the role of this axis in protrusive activity of the CX3CR1+ monocyte-derived cells . Because CX3CR1 is an important survival pathway , it is unclear whether these modifications are related to defects in chemotactic signal or cell survival . We did not observe defects in phagocytosis in CX3CR1-deficient mice ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that the recently recruited monocytes are functional , arguing in favour of a role of CX3CR1 in their survival ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Overall , our study provided important fundamental insights into the behaviour of tissue monocytes during the process of immune surveillance in comparison to resident macrophages and DC in a key biological tissue . We concluded that tissue monocytes represent a major first line phagocytic compartment in comparison to DC . Monocyte-derived cells developed an organized distribution at the interface between blood and airways with a specific pattern of movements in the lungs to enable them to rapidly detect danger , trigger inflammation , capture antigen , and undergo subsequent immune response . Understanding these activities is a key step towards improving the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases and also vaccination strategies targeting the route of antigen uptake .\nCx3cr1-GFP-Kin ( Cx3cr1gfp/+ ) or Itgax-YFP transgenic mice ( CD11c-YFP ) ( Lindquist et al . , 2004 ) and Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP ( MacBlue ) ( Ovchinnikov et al . , 2008 ) were intercrossed to generate Cx3cr1gfp/+×Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP mice herein called MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ or MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/gfp , and MacBlue×Itgax-YFP , respectively . These new strains were bred in the Nouvelle Animalerie Commune animal facility at Pitié-Salpêtrière . Cx3cr1gfp/+-Ccr2rfp/+ mice were kindly provided by Israel Charo ( Gladstone Institute , San Francisco , CA , USA ) ( Saederup et al . , 2010 ) to generate Cx3cr1gfp/gfp-Ccr2rfp/+ , Cx3cr1gfp/+-Ccr2rfp/- , and Cx3cr1gfp/gfp-Ccr2rfp/rfp mouse strains . All mice were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age . C57Bl6 female host parabionts were generated with MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+females and analysed after 1 month of parabiosis . Blood leukocyte chimerism was evaluated 2 weeks after surgery , and showed a T cell chimerism of 50 ± 10% . In these settings , monocyte chimerism from B6 to MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ was around 37 ± 14% and MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ to B6 was reduced to 14 ± 13% . All experiment protocols were approved by the French animal experimentation and ethics committee and validated by Service Protection et Santé Animales , Environnement ( no . A-75-2065 ) . Sample sizes were chosen to ensure the reproducibility of the experiments and according to the 3Rs of animal ethics regulation . A total of 1011 FluoroSpheres carboxylate–modified microspheres ( 200 nm ) ( Invitrogen , Eugene , OR , USA ) were inoculated either by intravenous or airway routes . Phagocytosis by lung subsets was analysed 4 hr after inoculation by flow cytometry . Bead inhalation was performed by loading a 10 µl drop of NaCl 0 . 9% bead solution in each nostril of mice anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine/xylazine ( 100 and 10 mg/kg body weight , respectively ) . Mice for which bead inhalation failed have been excluded from the analysis . For in vivo CD45 labelling , mice were injected intravenously with 1 µg of anti-CD45 ( clone 30-F11 ) . Mice were sacrificed 2 min after blood was drawn . Lungs were harvested and bathed in a large volume of PBS to dilute free antibody . Flow cytometry was performed with the flow cytometer FACScanto or Fortessa ( BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ , USA ) and DIVA Flow Cytometry acquisition software , and was analysed with FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR , USA ) . After blood was drawn via retro-orbital puncture with heparin , the mouse lung vasculature was gently flushed with an intracardiac injection of PBS until complete blood clearance . For in vivo CD45 staining experiments , the lung vasculature was not flushed . Lungs were then harvested and digested in RPMI medium ( Gibco , Invitrogen , Cergy Pontoise , France ) with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV ( Sigma , St Quentin Fallavier , France ) for 30 min at 37°C and/or directly ( without collagenase incubation ) dissociated through a 70 μm-pore cell strainer ( Becton Dickinson , Rungis , France ) to obtain the cell suspension . Similarly , for some experiments blood was or was not incubated with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV . For antibody staining , 50 μL of cell suspension was incubated with 1 μg/mL purified anti-CD16/32 ( 2 . 4G2 ) ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) for 10 min at 4°C and for an additional 20 min with the appropriate dilution of specific antibodies . The panel of antibodies used was: anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone AL-21 ) , anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) , anti-NK1 . 1 ( clone PK136 ) , anti-CD45 ( clone 30-F11 ) , anti-CD11c ( clone HL3 ) , anti-I-Ab ( clone AF6-120-1 ) , anti-CD 62L ( clone MEL-14 ) , anti-SiglecF ( clone E50-2440 ) , anti-CD24 ( cloneM1/69 ) , anti-CD103 clone ( M290 ) , rat IgG2b isotype control ( BD Biosciences ) , F4/80 ( clone BM8 ) , CD115 ( clone AFS98 ) , rat IgG2a isotype control ( clone eBr2a; eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) , and anti-CD64 ( clone X54-5/7 . 1 . 1 ) ( BioLegend , San Diego , CA , USA ) . After incubation , cell suspensions were washed once in 0 . 5% BSA/2 mM EDTA in PBS and analysed directly by flow cytometry . For blood samples , erythrocytes were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 0 . 15 M NH4Cl , 0 . 01 mM KHCO3 and 0 . 1 mM EDTA and resuspended in 0 . 5% BSA/2 mM EDTA in PBS . FMO staining controls ( full minus one ) have been performed for all sets of experiment and are indicated in dot plots or histogram plots when necessary . Specific FMO gating for alveolar macrophages was required due to their bright autofluorescence . Absolute numbers were calculated by adding to each vial a fixed number ( 10 , 000 ) of non-fluorescent 10-µm Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres ( Polysciences , Niles , IL , USA ) according to the formula: no . cells = ( no . acquired cells × 10 , 000 ) / ( no . acquired beads ) . Briefly , organs were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 4 hr then incubated in 30% sucrose-PBS overnight at 4°C before being embedded in Tissue–Tek OCT compound ( Sakura Finetek , Alphen aan den Rijn , Netherlands ) and frozen at −80°C . Sectioning was completed on a HM550 Cryostat ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) at −20°C and 5 μm sections were collected on Superfrost Plus Slides ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and stored at −20°C until use . Vascular staining using beads was performed on histological sections of lung from MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice injected 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 µm Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres and 0 . 2 µm FluoroSpheres carboxylate . Lung sections were rehydrated with PBS for 10 min , counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI ( 4 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector Laboratories ) . Imaging used a Zeiss Axio Microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . CD31 vascular staining was performed on lung cryo-sections from MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice . A first blocking step was performed with 3% BSA/PBS solution for 30 min . Slides were then incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with the primary antibody rat anti-mouse CD31 ( 4 µg/ml ) ( clone MEC 13 . 3; Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , USA ) or the isotype control ( 4 µg/ml ) ( clone eBR2a; eBioscience ) . Slides were next incubated with Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit ( SP-2001; Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) and then stained with a biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG at 3 µg/ml for 30 min at room temperature . After three ( 5 min ) washes in PBS , slides were incubated with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin at 2 . 6 µg/ml for 30 min at room temperature ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA , USA ) . Slides were counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI and analysed by using a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal microscope coupled with 458 nm , 488 nm , and 543 nm lasers to detect ECFP , EGFP , and Cy3 simultaneously on three photomultipliers . Acquisition settings were identical for both isotype and CD31 staining . Volume rendering was performed using Imaris software ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) and parameters were set according to CD31 isotype staining . Freshly explanted lungs were immobilized in an imaging chamber perfused with oxygenated ( 95% O2 plus 5% CO2 ) RPMI medium containing 10% FCS . The local temperature was monitored and maintained at 37°C . For some experiments , 2 MkDa rhodamine dextran was injected intravenously 1 min before euthanasia and lung vasculature was ligatured to reduce leakage of the dye . The two-photon laser scanning microscopy ( TPLSM ) set-up used consisted of a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO multiphoton microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) coupled to a Ti:Sapphire crystal laser ( Coherent Chameleon Ultra , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) , which provides 140 fs pulses of NIR light , selectively tunable between 680 and 1080 nm , and an acousto-optic modulator to control laser power . The system included three external non-descanned detectors that enabled the simultaneous recording of three fluorescent channels with a combination of two dichroic mirrors ( 565 nm and 690 nm ) , 565/610 and 500/550 bandpass filters , and a 485 lowpass filter . The excitation wavelength was 870 nm . Cell motility was measured every 30 s by five consecutive 3 μm z spacing stacks ( total thickness of 12 μm ) with a plan apochromat × 20 ( NA = 1 ) water immersion objective . Fluorescent cells were monitored over time with three-dimensional automatic tracking and manual correction with Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . The different cell subsets were defined according to the fluorescent signature , the size , the shape , the localization , and the behaviour . Typically AM are ECFPbright , large , round , and sessile cells located in the lumen of alveoli . Patrolling monocytes are ECFP+ and small with an amoeboid-like shape displaying strong displacements in the interalveolar space . Interstitial monocyte-derived cells are ECFP+ sessile cells displaying protrusive activity in the interalveolar space . Interstitial EGFP+ are either small and round ( likely NK ) in the lung alveolar space , or dendritic-shaped in the pleura and along airways . Cells that could not be tracked for more than 2 min were not considered . The arrest coefficient was defined as the proportion of time each cell’s instantaneous velocity ( calculated for every 30 s interval ) was less than 2 μm/min . The MC was determined on a 2D-based analysis by z projection of the 3D stacks , using the formula ( x²/4 t ) ( where x represents the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time ) ( Cahalan and Parker , 2008 ) ( see statistical section ) . Coefficient of sphericity variation was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation with Graphpad Prism ( Graphpad , San Diego , CA , USA ) of the sphericity determined for each cell on 10 consecutive planes ( 5 min ) . Velocity and sphericity were determined using Imaris ( Bitplane ) . The acquisition and analysis protocols for all experimental conditions to be compared were identical . All statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism . For intravital analysis of cell behaviour , each sample value was first tested for Gaussian distribution by the D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test . Accordingly , multigroup comparison tests were performed by one-way ANOVA for parametric distribution followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test or Kruskal–Wallis test for non-parametric distributions , followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test . For simple comparison analysis , Student’s t test was performed to compare parametric distribution and Mann–Whitney rank sum tests were performed to compare non-parametric distribution . For MC measurement , the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time ( Cahalan and Parker , 2008 ) was calculated by linear regression statistical analysis . Linearity was considered significant for r² >0 . 9 . Symbols used: * , p<0 . 05; ** , p<0 . 01; *** , p<0 . 001 .",
         "White blood cells form part of the immune system , which protects the body against infectious diseases and other harmful agents . Some of these cells , including ‘mononuclear phagocytes’ , can reside within different tissues of the body , such as the lungs . Other less specialized cells , called monocytes , circulate in the bloodstream . It had long been thought that once these monocytes had taken up residence in a tissue , they could only develop into tissue-resident phagocytes . Several researchers , however , recently reported that monocytes can also reside within tissues without becoming more specialized . Nevertheless , it remained unclear what these cells did when they were in these tissues . Rodero , Poupel , Loyher et al . investigated the activities of tissue-resident monocytes found in the lungs of mice . First , mice were genetically engineered to produce fluorescent markers that meant that their monocytes could be easily distinguished from the mononuclear phagocytes in their lungs when viewed under a microscope . Rodero , Poupel , Loyher et al . then showed that the monocytes and the other mononuclear phagocytes localized to different regions of the lung . Further experiments showed that these two groups of cells also moved around the lungs in different ways . The tissue-resident monocytes surveyed both the blood vessels and airways , while the other tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes only surveyed the airways . These findings show that lung-resident monocytes perform a different role to those found in the bloodstream . The findings also open the way to improving our understanding of what tissue-resident monocytes do in other organs , and in healthy or diseased animals .",

         "The aim of the current study was to analyse and compare their contribution to innate immune surveillance of the lung in the steady state with macrophage and dendritic cells  . We used these transgenes to study the migratory properties of monocytes and macrophages by functional imaging on explanted lungs . Migratory monocytes were found to be either patrolling within large vessels of the lung or locating at the interface between lung capillaries and alveoli . The mononuclear phagocytic system  consists of a family of cells—including monocytes , macrophages , and dendritic cells  —that are derived from common committed bone marrow progenitors and perform related functions  . The lung is a mucosal surface of the body , exposed constantly to inhaled particles including pathogens , as well as other potential toxins  . Lung mononuclear phagocytes have been shown to adapt specifically to the lung environment , and contribute to lung homeostasis , scavenging , and immune surveillance  . Monocytes were originally considered to be circulating precursors of macrophages , participating in renewal of tissue-resident macrophages in steady state and recruited in large numbers in response to inflammatory stimuli  . Fate mapping approaches and parabiosis experiments have been used to argue that tissue-resident macrophages such as alveolar macrophages  may be seeded from the yolk sac or foetal liver during embryonic development and can be maintained in the absence of monocyte recruitment  . However , others have suggested the models used in these studies may disturb the availability of the key growth factor , CSF1 , and do not necessarily reflect the steady state  . Macrophages isolated from different organs have distinct expression profiles which can be distinguished further if the cells are separated according to their surface markers  . Unfortunately , no available surface marker is well correlated with any other marker , at either the protein or mRNA level  , so the number of macrophage subsets definable by flow cytometry is essentially infinite  . In the mouse , one subset called classical monocytes , expresses high levels of both Ly6C and the chemokine receptor CCR2 but a low level of the fractalkine  receptor CX3CR1 , while the second , the so-called non-classical monocytes , lacks Ly6C but expresses a high level of CX3CR1  . In contrast to what we know about tissue macrophages , very little information is available on how monocytes behave after entering tissues . Myeloid-restricted fluorescent reporter genes based upon various lineage-restricted genes have been used in live imaging and functional genomics  . A Csf1r-EGFP reporter gene serves as a definitive marker of MPS cells  , while a Cx3cr1-EGFP reporter labels the non-classical monocytes as well as subsets of tissue macrophages , including microglia , as well as a subset of natural killer  lymphocytes  . However , this reporter is rather uniformly expressed in tissue macrophages associated with mucosa and in the lung provides a generic MPS marker  . The deletion of a conserved distal element of the Csf1r promoter in the Csf1r-ECFPtg/+ mouse  ablates expression of a reporter gene in trophoblasts , osteoclasts , granulocytes , and many tissue macrophages  . This deleted promoter was used to construct an amplified binary transgene in which Csf1r promoter elements direct the expression of gal4-VP16 , which in turn activates expression of a UAS-ECFP transgene . All blood monocytes in these MacBlue mice are strongly ECFP+ , whereas most tissue macrophages do not express the reporter protein  . In the current study , we combined the myeloid-specific fluorescent reporters from MacBlue mice with either Cx3cr1gfp/+ or Itgax-YFP transgenic mice to support in situ imaging of lung monocyte cell trafficking and compare their phagocytic activity with that of resident mononuclear phagocytes . The MacBlue binary transgene  provides a unique marker of blood monocytes  . Two-photon laser scanning microscopy 3D-reconstruction of fresh explanted lung and histological section of cryo-preserved lungs from these mice identified distinct subsets with distinct morphologies and distributions within the organ  . Stellar EGFP+ECFPneg cells were seen in the collagen membrane surrounding the lung pleura  , deeper in the lung parenchyma with small round shapes or stellar shapes  , and along the basal membranes of bronchial airways  . The luminal side of airways and alveoli contained large round ECFP+ cells , likely AM  . Smaller amoeboid-like ECFP+ cells were located in the interstitial space of the lung parenchyma  . In overview , the pattern was consistent with previous evidence that the MacBlue ECFP transgene was expressed only in AM and monocyte-like cells , whereas most interstitial CX3CR1-EGFP expressing cells lacked expression .

Satellite images represent higher magnification of the corresponding coloured squares for each image . 003 To establish the relationship between the cells that could be imaged in situ and their cellular phenotypes in MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice , we applied a panel of phenotypic markers including CD11b , CD115 , Ly6C , Ly6G , F4/80 , CD64 , CD11c , IAb , CD62L , NK1 . 1 , and SiglecF to discriminate four different subsets of the lung based on their EGFP/ECFP signature in the double transgenic line  and compared them to blood populations  . The lungs contained two ECFPbright populations , either EGFPbright or EGFPdim  resembling those observed in the blood  . 1negCD64+CD11c+ phenotype  , consistent with the phenotype of the Ly6Clow monocyte subset   . As expected , the lung also contained an ECFPhighEGFPneg signature  . 1negCD11chighCD64highSiglecFhigh cells , consistent with their identity as AM .

A subset of these cells in the lung labelled with NK1 . In the blood , the majority of ECFPnegEGFPbright cells labelled with NK1 . 1  , but the population also included immature myeloid cells as previously reported  . In summary , the binary expression of the two transgenic reporters in MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice permits the identification of monocytes in tissues , and their distinction from other mononuclear phagocyte subsets as well as from NK cells . In order to confirm the monocyte origin of the ECFP+EGFPlow/high -Ly6Chigh and -Ly6Clow monocytes , we generated parabionts of the double transgenic MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ with C57Bl6 mice and analysed the reconstitution after 1 month of parabiosis . In the lung , donor-derived ECFP cells displayed Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte phenotypes  , were small in size , with ameboid-like morphologies , and were all located in the interalveolar space  . By contrast , neither AM nor interstitial macrophages were derived from the donor as there was no expression of the transgenes in these compartments  . The only cells expressing EGFP but not ECFP , were NK cells derived from the donor  . Histograms represent the expression of monocyte markers on the CX3CR1low  and CX3CR1high cells  . 006 To evaluate the function of chemotactic signals in the lung , we compared the frequency of the different subsets defined above in Ccr2−/− , Cx3cr1−/− , and Ccr2−/−Cx3cr1−/−  mice in the blood and the lung  . Consistent with published studies  , the frequency of circulating Ly6Chigh monocytes was similar in wild-type  and Cx3cr1−/− mice . By contrast , the absence of CX3CR1 did impact on the yield of Ly6Chigh cells in the lung . As expected , this subset was strongly reduced in Ccr2−/− mice and dKO mice in both the blood and the lungs  . Ly6Clow monocyte frequency was similar in Ccr2−/− mice but significantly reduced in Cx3cr1−/− and dKO mice in both the blood and the lungs compared to WT mice  . Together , these results showed that CCR2 and CX3CR1 control the steady-state trafficking and survival of both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocyte-derived cells in the lungs . Bars represent quantification as a percentage of CD45+ cells of the defined cell subsets from  the blood and  the lungs in Cx3cr1gfp/+Ccr2rfp/+  , Cx3cr1gfp/gfpCcr2rfp/+  , Cx3cr1gfp/+Ccr2rfp/-  , and Cx3cr1gfp/gfpCcr2rfp/rfp  mice . Bars represent means ± SEM  . Small interstitial ECFP+ cells  with an amoeboid-like shape displayed a bimodal behaviour: they were either highly motile , going backwards and forwards between the alveoli , or relatively sessile with protrusions extending towards the lumen of the alveoli  . Intravenous injection of rhodamine dextran prior to mouse sacrifice permitted , during a short time frame before vascular leakage , to determine that fast moving patrolling ECFP+ cells were located inside large vessels , whereas slow motile ECFP+ cells appeared to be extravascular but in close contact with the vasculature  . Aside from monocytes , large round ECFPbright AM  were detected in the alveolar lumina , leisurely surveying the surface of the airways with a velocity of 2 ± 1 . Interstitial EGFP+ cells also migrated slowly , with comparable velocity and arrest coefficient to AM  . To determine their motility coefficient  , we plotted the mean square displacement as a function of the square root of time . This higher MC in interstitial ECFP+ monocytes was attributable to the protrusive activity and slow displacement suggesting scanning of the interalveolar space  . Time lapse imaging of explanted non-transgenic lungs from parabiont mice showed similar scanning behaviour  , supporting the monocyte origin of these cells . In overview , while AM survey the luminal side of the alveoli , interstitial monocyte-derived cells survey the lung tissue through either active patrolling in the vasculature or protrusive activity toward the alveolar space . Lung mononuclear phagocytes constitutively survey the entire space of the alveolar areas through distinct migratory patterns .

The absence of functional CX3CR1 did not change the arrest coefficient  but did slightly reduce the MC of patrolling cells  . As might be anticipated given their lack of CX3CR1 expression , AM behaviour was also comparable in WT and Cx3cr1−/− mice  . On the other hand , deletion of the CX3CR1 clearly altered the behaviour of the interstitial ECFP+ cells , which showed a greatly increased arrest coefficient and reduced MC  . In the absence of CX3CR1 , the remaining interstitial ECFP+ cells present had greatly reduced protrusive activity , as indicated by increased global ‘sphericity’  and reduced sphericity variation  .

CD11c is expressed on all tissue macrophages in the lung , but is absent from monocytes . To compare the roles of these cells in particle clearance , we combined MacBlue with the Itgax-YFP transgene  and again compared the fluorescent signatures of different mononuclear phagocyte populations  . We determined the mean fluorescence intensity  of EGFP , ECFP , and YFP reporters from the MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ and MacBlue×Itgax-YFP in these subsets  . EGFP and ECFP fluorescent reporter expressions were mainly restricted to lung macrophage and monocyte subsets as previously described  . Although CD11c mRNA and surface protein are expressed widely among tissue macrophages in the lung , YFP expression was mainly restricted to the defined classical DC subsets with a brighter expression for CD11b− DC  . Histological analysis of a lung section of MacBlue×Itgax-YFP showed that YFPbright cells were mainly located along bronchial airways and poorly distributed in the alveolar space in contrast to ECFP+ monocytes and AM  . Interstitial monocyte-derived cells localized in the alveolar space whereas lung dendritic cells preferentially localized near large airways . Dot plots show the gating strategy to define the different lung mononuclear phagocytes and dendritic cells from either MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ or MacBlue×Itgax-YFP mice . Histogram plots represent the EGFP , ECFP , and YFP fluorescent reporter expression by each defined subset . YFP and EGFP were measured on individual mice .

Satellite images represent higher magnification of the corresponding white squares . We inoculated mice with fluorescent beads either by intravenous or airway routes and compared the proportion of phagocytic cells in different lung subsets 4 hr after bead inoculation  . inoculation , only monocytic cells appeared to have taken up particles  . After airway inhalation , AM were the main phagocytic subset  , but particles were also detected among interstitial cells . The numbers of phagocytic Ly6Clow and Ly6Chigh monocytes were significantly higher compared to the number of phagocytic DC after airway inhalation , showing that lung monocytes are the only subsets that effectively capture both blood-derived and airway-derived fluorescent particles  .

Graph represents the frequency of phagocytic cells as a percentage of the respective subset after intravenous injection  or airway inhalation  . Graph represents the number of phagocytic cell subset per mg of collected tissue . Student’s t tests were performed to compare the phagocytic activity of all subsets to the referent population of Ly6Clow monocytes . 018 In order to further discriminate lung monocytes from circulating monocytes , we performed blood/tissue partitioning using in vivo CD45 labelling as reported by others  . Up to 90% of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow lung monocytes were labelled by the anti-CD45 antibody in vivo; however , the MFI was significantly lower compared to that of blood monocytes  . Indeed lung monocytes displayed reduced expression of Ly6C , CD62L , and CD115 as previously observed , in addition to a higher level of CD11b , whereas only Ly6Clow monocytes displayed higher CD11c expression  . The same differences were observed in monocytes isolated from lung without enzymatic digestion  . These results suggest that monocytes can be either extravascular but in close vicinity to the vessels or still intravascular and trapped in capillaries with reduced access to the bloodstream and submitted to the lung environment . 2 µm red fluorescent beads to differentiate large vessel areas identified by the presence of both 10 µm and 0 . 2 µm beads , and lung capillary areas identified by only 0 . In large vessels , ECFP+ cells were mainly round shaped , whereas in the vicinity of capillaries , interstitial ECFP+ cells displayed an elongated or amoeboid-like shape  . Confocal analysis of the microvascular area using CD31 staining showed that interstitial ECFP+ cells locate at the interface between the capillaries and the alveoli either intra- or extravascularly  . CD45 in vivo labelling was exactly the same for both Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes that had captured the beads compared to non-phagocytic monocytes  .

High resolution 3D reconstruction shows lung ECFP+ cell localisation at the interface between lung capillaries and airways . Lung vasculature has been stained with anti-CD31  or isotype control  in a lung cryo-section of a MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mouse . Volume rendering parameters were determined based on CD31 isotype staining . Fluorescent myeloid-specific reporter transgenic mice have been widely used to study the behaviour of myeloid cells in vivo , although no transgenic reporter is restricted to a particular myeloid lineage  . A wide diversity of cell subsets are labelled in the Cx3cr1gfp/+ system , including NK cells , which can be excluded only with a specific γc-deficient background  . The MacBlue binary transgene , based upon a deleted Csf1r promoter , produced a transgenic line in which the reporter gene is extinguished in the majority of mature tissue macrophages and greatly reduced in granulocytes  . Despite the fact that ECFP expression is not directly related to the level of Csf1r mRNA , it provides a unique marker of cells that have recently derived from monocytes . In the current study , we intercrossed Cx3cr1gfp/+ and MacBlue mice to obtain an additional dimension of resolution and specificity . Monocytes were easily distinguishable from other subsets due to their common expression of ECFP . The differential expression of EGFP enabled a further distinction between Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes . Although our imaging approach did not allow us to distinguish between the two monocyte subsets , the shape , size , tissue localization , and behaviour of the ECFP+ cells provided a unique opportunity to track lung tissue mononuclear phagocytes and to compare their migratory patterns . The dual reporter also avoids potential artefacts created by the γc-deficient background excluding NK cells which we have shown to be highly represented in the CX3CR1-GFP+ fraction within the lungs . The combination of CCR2 and CX3CR1 deficient mice and parabionts permitted a more precise characterization of the nature and origin of the different subsets and confirmed that interstitial ECFP+ were monocyte-derived according to the proposed unified nomenclature  . Krummel’s group previously performed functional imaging of lung DC using the Itgax-YFP reporter  . The combination of this reporter with the MacBlue mouse confirmed that interstitial monocyte-derived cells were distinct from lung DC . Histological analysis showed that monocyte-derived cells and DC share the surveillance activity through distinct regional distribution , the former located in the alveolar space at the interface with the bloodstream and the latter near larger bronchial airways . This specific regional segregation at steady state is likely the result of the rapid circulation of monocytes that arrest constitutively in the capillaries of the alveolar space with relatively short life span  , whereas DC are slow motile cells  . Of course regional segregation is likely less marked in the allergic asthma model for which important DC recruitment was observed in the vicinity of the alveoli , likely originating from monocytes  , where they exert longer transepithelial dendrites formation toward airways  . Four hours after intranasal inoculation , fluorescent particles remained undetectable in the mediastinal lymph nodes , as previously observed  , however after 1 d , DC seem to prevail over monocytes in the transport of the inhaled particles . We combined in vivo CD45 labelling and confocal imaging to determine the precise location of lung monocytes  . However , we showed that lung monocytes have a slightly differentiated phenotype compared to the circulating monocytes with a downregulation of CD115 and CD62L and an upregulation of CD11b and CD11c . Secondly , the proportions of Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes were different in the lungs compared to the blood . Several studies used in situ imaging of the lung  , but it is likely that working on lung explants may somehow affect the dynamics of the studied cells . Nevertheless , we still observed high velocity patrolling cells that were present within large vessels , suggesting that this migration is independent of the blood flow . showed that CX3CL1 was expressed by the epithelial cells of bronchioles and in the alveolar space using the CX3CL1-RFP reporters  , arguing in favour of the role of this axis in protrusive activity of the CX3CR1+ monocyte-derived cells . Because CX3CR1 is an important survival pathway , it is unclear whether these modifications are related to defects in chemotactic signal or cell survival . We did not observe defects in phagocytosis in CX3CR1-deficient mice  , suggesting that the recently recruited monocytes are functional , arguing in favour of a role of CX3CR1 in their survival  . Monocyte-derived cells developed an organized distribution at the interface between blood and airways with a specific pattern of movements in the lungs to enable them to rapidly detect danger , trigger inflammation , capture antigen , and undergo subsequent immune response . Understanding these activities is a key step towards improving the treatment of a wide range of inflammatory diseases and also vaccination strategies targeting the route of antigen uptake . Cx3cr1-GFP-Kin  or Itgax-YFP transgenic mice   and Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP   were intercrossed to generate Cx3cr1gfp/+×Csf1r-Gal4VP16/UAS-ECFP mice herein called MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ or MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/gfp , and MacBlue×Itgax-YFP , respectively . All mice were used between 8 and 12 weeks of age . C57Bl6 female host parabionts were generated with MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+females and analysed after 1 month of parabiosis . Blood leukocyte chimerism was evaluated 2 weeks after surgery , and showed a T cell chimerism of 50 ± 10% . Mice were sacrificed 2 min after blood was drawn . Lungs were then harvested and digested in RPMI medium  with 1 mg/ml collagenase IV  for 30 min at 37°C and/or directly  dissociated through a 70 μm-pore cell strainer  to obtain the cell suspension . The panel of antibodies used was: anti-CD11b  , anti-Ly6C  , anti-Ly6G  , anti-NK1 . 1  , anti-CD45  , anti-CD11c  , anti-I-Ab  , anti-CD 62L  , anti-SiglecF  , anti-CD24  , anti-CD103 clone  , rat IgG2b isotype control  , F4/80  , CD115  , rat IgG2a isotype control  , and anti-CD64   . FMO staining controls  have been performed for all sets of experiment and are indicated in dot plots or histogram plots when necessary . Specific FMO gating for alveolar macrophages was required due to their bright autofluorescence . Absolute numbers were calculated by adding to each vial a fixed number  of non-fluorescent 10-µm Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres  according to the formula: no . Briefly , organs were harvested and fixed in 10% formalin for 4 hr then incubated in 30% sucrose-PBS overnight at 4°C before being embedded in Tissue–Tek OCT compound  and frozen at −80°C . Sectioning was completed on a HM550 Cryostat  at −20°C and 5 μm sections were collected on Superfrost Plus Slides  and stored at −20°C until use . Vascular staining using beads was performed on histological sections of lung from MacBlue×Cx3cr1gfp/+ mice injected 5 min before sacrifice with a mixture of 10 µm Polybead Carboxylate Microspheres and 0 . Lung sections were rehydrated with PBS for 10 min , counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI  . Imaging used a Zeiss Axio Microscope  . Slides were then incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with the primary antibody rat anti-mouse CD31   or the isotype control   . Slides were next incubated with Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit  and then stained with a biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG at 3 µg/ml for 30 min at room temperature . Slides were counterstained and mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI and analysed by using a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO confocal microscope coupled with 458 nm , 488 nm , and 543 nm lasers to detect ECFP , EGFP , and Cy3 simultaneously on three photomultipliers . Volume rendering was performed using Imaris software  and parameters were set according to CD31 isotype staining . Freshly explanted lungs were immobilized in an imaging chamber perfused with oxygenated  RPMI medium containing 10% FCS . The two-photon laser scanning microscopy  set-up used consisted of a Zeiss LSM 710 NLO multiphoton microscope  coupled to a Ti:Sapphire crystal laser  , which provides 140 fs pulses of NIR light , selectively tunable between 680 and 1080 nm , and an acousto-optic modulator to control laser power . The system included three external non-descanned detectors that enabled the simultaneous recording of three fluorescent channels with a combination of two dichroic mirrors  , 565/610 and 500/550 bandpass filters , and a 485 lowpass filter . Cell motility was measured every 30 s by five consecutive 3 μm z spacing stacks  with a plan apochromat × 20  water immersion objective . Fluorescent cells were monitored over time with three-dimensional automatic tracking and manual correction with Imaris software  . Typically AM are ECFPbright , large , round , and sessile cells located in the lumen of alveoli . Interstitial monocyte-derived cells are ECFP+ sessile cells displaying protrusive activity in the interalveolar space . Interstitial EGFP+ are either small and round  in the lung alveolar space , or dendritic-shaped in the pleura and along airways . Cells that could not be tracked for more than 2 min were not considered . The MC was determined on a 2D-based analysis by z projection of the 3D stacks , using the formula     . Coefficient of sphericity variation was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation with Graphpad Prism  of the sphericity determined for each cell on 10 consecutive planes  . The acquisition and analysis protocols for all experimental conditions to be compared were identical . For intravital analysis of cell behaviour , each sample value was first tested for Gaussian distribution by the D'Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test . Accordingly , multigroup comparison tests were performed by one-way ANOVA for parametric distribution followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test or Kruskal–Wallis test for non-parametric distributions , followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test . For simple comparison analysis , Student’s t test was performed to compare parametric distribution and Mann–Whitney rank sum tests were performed to compare non-parametric distribution . For MC measurement , the slope of the mean displacement as a function of the square root of time  was calculated by linear regression statistical analysis . Symbols used: * , p<0 . "
