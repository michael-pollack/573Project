If you look at the Elife Document Length bar graph above that at about 110000 words in length we have a handful of very lengthy documents. This will allow us to cut back on the amount of processing and time. We will also benefit from not having content from extra large documents over weighting our tf-idf scores. We removed 53 large outlier articles."

    "One of the other problems we encountered when inspecting the data is the large amount of academic in text citations. These citations cause several issues, they're so common that they occur far more frequently than content words do, which creates extra noise. They're also full of punctuation which messes with the mechanics of the sentence tokenizer we selected. This resulted in a lot of \"false\" sentences. To solve these issues we removed the citations and moved the function to do so up above the more standard cleaning function. This allows us to keep our sentence index stable throughout the process while also cutting the amount of sentences per doc by almost half."

    "To begin processing our data to create extractive summaries we implement a method of assigning vectors to words called Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency(tf-idf). This process allows us to assign a concept of importance and meaning to words in our documents represented by a number. This is done by first getting the term frequency, a count of each term in its document divided by the total number of terms in that document. Then the inverse document frequency, which is the total number of documents in our corpus divided by the number of documents containing some specific word, that value is then multiplied by log base e. We will do this for each document to produce a unique set of vector word pairs. The higher a vector, the more important that word is to that document. "

         "Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication , known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses , respectively . Chemical synapses can be identified by their multiple structural components . Electrical synapses are , on the other hand , generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’ ( a cluster of intercellular channels ) between two neuronal processes . However , while gap junctions provide the communicating mechanism , it is unknown whether electrical transmission requires the contribution of additional cellular structures . We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells , at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse . Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures . Multiple gap junctions of variable size were identified by the presence of their molecular components . Remarkably , most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions , suggesting a close functional association between these two structures . In contrast , glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact , indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse . Thus , our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one , but multiple gap junctions , in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions . The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses . \n Synapses are specialized cell–cell contacts where two neurons can share relevant functional information . The exchange of information can occur directly through cell–cell channels , known as ‘electrical synapses’ , or indirectly , via the release of a chemical messenger , known as ‘chemical synapses’ ( Pereda , 2014 ) . While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses with structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components has long been recognized ( Wichmann and Kuner , 2022; Wilhelm et al . , 2014 ) , less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses . Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as ‘gap junctions’ ( GJs ) ( Goodenough and Paul , 2009 ) . These structures contain intercellular channels formed by the apposition of two hemichannels , each provided by one of the connected cells , and which cluster together into GJ ‘plaques’ ( Goodenough and Paul , 2009 ) . Hemichannels are formed by proteins called ‘connexins’ ( Goodenough and Paul , 2009; Söhl and Willecke , 2004 ) in vertebrates and ‘innexins’ ( Phelan et al . , 1998; Phelan , 2005 ) in invertebrates that , though unrelated in sequence , share a similar membrane topology that allows them to assemble into intercellular channels . While GJs are ubiquitous and present in virtually every tissue of the organism providing metabolic coupling ( Goodenough and Paul , 2009 ) , they additionally serve as a pathway of low resistance for the spread of electrical currents between neurons ( and cells of the heart ) , the main form of signaling in the brain , which is fast enough to operate within the time frame required for decision-making by neural circuits ( Bennett , 1997; Alcamí and Pereda , 2019 ) . Electrical synapses are generally perceived as structurally simpler than chemical synapses and exclusively involving the function of intercellular channels . However , recent data indicates that the function of these channels is under the control of their supporting molecular scaffold ( Flores et al . , 2008; Lasseigne et al . , 2021; Martin et al . , 2020; Martin et al . , 2023 ) , suggesting that neuronal GJs are complex molecular structures whose function requires the contribution of multiple molecular components ( Miller and Pereda , 2017 ) . Such molecular complexity is likely to underlie plastic changes in the strength of electrical synapses ( Pereda et al . , 2013; O’Brien and Bloomfield , 2018 ) , which are capable of dynamically reconfiguring neural circuits ( O’Brien and Bloomfield , 2018; Bloomfield and Völgyi , 2009 ) . Thus far , investigations of the properties of vertebrate electrical transmission have solely considered the functional properties of the channel-forming proteins , the connexins , the molecules that regulate them , and their interactions at the GJ plaque . However , could a single neuronal GJ per se be considered an electrical synapse ? Alternatively , does electrical transmission rely on additional structural components ? The identification of the structural components of a chemical synapse is facilitated by the presynaptic bouton , which anatomically defines its limit ( Sotelo , 2020 ) . In contrast , neuronal GJs are typically found connecting cell somata or other neuronal processes ( Alcamí and Pereda , 2019; Sotelo , 2020; Sotelo and Llinás , 1972 ) , such as dendrites and axons , making it more difficult to define the exact anatomical boundaries that constitute an electrical synapse . Neuronal GJs can also occur at synaptic boutons , generally coexisting with specializations for chemical transmission ( Sotelo , 2020; Martin and Pilar , 1963 ) . This is the case for auditory afferents terminating as single ‘large myelinated club endings’ ( Bartelmez , 1915; Bartelmez and Hoerr , 1933 ) or ‘club endings’ ( CEs ) on the lateral dendrite of the teleost Mauthner cells ( a pair of large reticulospinal neurons involved in tail-flip escape responses in fish ) ( Pereda and Faber , 2011; Faber and Pereda , 2011 ) , each containing GJs and specializations for chemical transmission ( Robertson et al . , 1963 ) . Because of their experimental accessibly and functional properties , these terminals are considered a valuable model to study vertebrate electrical transmission as they more easily allow for the correlation between structure and function of synaptic features ( Pereda et al . , 2013; Robertson et al . , 1963; Furshpan , 1964; Flores et al . , 2012 ) . Since the bouton marks the anatomical limits of a synapse , these contacts offer the opportunity to examine the anatomical structures that together make an electrical synapse . Here , we used expansion microscopy ( Tillberg et al . , 2016 ) to expose the presence and spatial arrangement of synaptic components in CEs of larval zebrafish . CEs from larval zebrafish share comparable morphological and functional properties with those of adult fish ( Lasseigne et al . , 2021; Yao et al . , 2014; Miller et al . , 2017; Echeverry et al . , 2022 ) , and due to their genetic accessibility , allow for the opportunity to investigate the functional link between the structures enabling electrical transmission and its regulation . Expansion revealed the presence of multiple well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact area , which , consistent with the notion that they represent GJ plaques , each exhibited labeling for the fish homologs of the widespread mammalian connexin 36 ( Cx36 ) , Cx35 , and Cx34 , as well as for the GJ scaffolding protein zonula occludens ( ZO1 ) ( Flores et al . , 2008; Lasseigne et al . , 2021; Miller et al . , 2017; Rash et al . , 2013 ) . Strikingly , expansion following staining with N-cadherin and ß-catenin antibodies , protein components of ‘adherens junctions’ ( AJs ) , showed that these proteins are also distributed all throughout the contact area , but in a fashion that is mutually exclusive with connexin . This suggests that the subsynaptic topography of electrical synapses is carefully and intimately coordinated . Finally , double labeling with Cx and glutamate receptor antibodies showed that , while GJs are distributed throughout the entire contact area , a much smaller number of glutamatergic sites are restricted to the periphery occupying a small fraction ( ~19% ) of the contact’s surface . Thus , our data suggest that synaptic communication at electrical synapses results from not one but the coordinated action of multiple GJs of variable size , which may require the functional contribution of additional structures , such as AJs . \n A group of auditory afferents , each of which terminate as a single synaptic contact , known as a club ending ( CE ) , on the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner ( M- ) cell ( Bartelmez , 1915; Bartelmez and Hoerr , 1933; Figure 1A ) . Because of their unusual large size and experimental accessibility , CEs represent a valued model for the correlation of synaptic structure and function . Ultrastructural analysis of CEs in adult goldfish ( Robertson et al . , 1963; Tuttle et al . , 1986; Kohno and Noguchi , 1986 ) and larval zebrafish ( Yao et al . , 2014 ) revealed the presence of GJs coexisting with specializations for neurotransmitter release . Consistent with these synaptic specializations , stimulation of CEs evokes a synaptic response that combines electrical and chemical transmission ( Furshpan , 1964; Yao et al . , 2014; Echeverry et al . , 2022; Lin and Faber , 1988 ) . A wealth of evidence indicates that GJs at these terminals consist of heterotypic intercellular channels created by the apposition of a presynaptic hemichannel formed by connexin Cx35 . 5 and a postsynaptic hemichannel formed by Cx34 . 1 , two of the Cx35 ( Cx35 . 1 and Cx35 . 5 ) and Cx34 ( Cx34 . 1 and Cx34 . 7 ) orthologs ( Miller et al . , 2017; Rash et al . , 2013 ) . These junctions also contain the scaffolding protein ZO1 ( Flores et al . , 2008; Lasseigne et al . , 2021 ) , which regulates channel function . The synaptic contact areas of CEs ( Figure 1A ) can be visualized and unambiguously identified by immunolabeling for these GJ proteins , which are revealed as large fluorescent oval areas at the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the M-cell ( Figure 1B–D ) . Immunolabeling is commonly used to define the biochemical composition of a synapse by allowing detection of the presence of specific proteins . We combined this approach with a protein-retention expansion microscopy protocol ( proExM; Tillberg et al . , 2016 ) to explore not only the presence but the relative distribution of the structures formed by various synaptic proteins throughout the contact areas of CEs in 5 days post fertilization ( dpf ) zebrafish . Tissue expansion with anti-Cx35 . 5 revealed the presence of multiple Cx35 . 5-positive puncta at these contacts forming a concave oval area ( Figure 1E , Figure 1—video 1 ) , reminiscent of that observed at goldfish CEs , known to correspond to GJ plaques ( Flores et al . , 2008; Pereda et al . , 2003 ) . The main diameter of the oval synaptic contact area defined by labeling of Cx35 . 5 , either using anti-Cx35/36 ( which recognizes both Cx35 . 5 and Cx35 . 1 ) or a specific anti-Cx35 . 5 , or of ZO1 with anti-ZO1 , increased about fourfold ( 3 . 9× expansion factor ) , from 2 . 11 ± 0 . 037 µm in non-expansion experiments ( n = 38 CEs from 26 fish ) to 8 . 25 ± 0 . 225 µm in expansion experiments ( n = 40 CEs from 13 fish ) ( mean ± SEM ) . Moreover , expansion led to an about 13-fold increase in the area of the contact ( 13 . 4× ) , from 2 . 63 ± 0 . 055 µm2 ( n = 38 CEs from 26 fish ) to 35 . 13 ± 1 . 266 µm2 ( n = 40 CEs from 13 fish ) . A concern when using proExM is whether this procedure leads to the distortion of normal anatomical features . Therefore , to determine the degree of isotropy of the expansion , we measured the ratio between the short and long diameters of the CE oval areas ( S/L ratio ) in non- and post-expanded samples . The short and long diameters in non-expanded tissue averaged 1 . 62 ± 0 . 026 µm and 2 . 11 ± 0 . 037 µm ( n = 38 CEs from 26 fish ) , respectively , and 5 . 16 ± 0 . 142 µm and 8 . 25 ± 0 . 225 µm ( n = 40 CEs from 13 fish ) , respectively , in expanded terminals . Analysis showed that the average S/L ratio decreased in the expanded tissue , with the decrease reaching statistical significance ( non-expanded , 0 . 77 ± 0 . 018 [n = 38 CEs from 26 fish]; expanded , 0 . 64 ± 0 . 019 [n = 40 CEs from 13 fish]; p<0 . 01 ) . However , the decrease in the average S/L ratio was less than 18% . Moreover , the distribution of S/L ratios from expanded tissue was nearly identical to the distribution from non-expanded tissue , and both were well described by normal distributions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . This result indicates that the expansion procedure had no selective effects on CEs , but rather affected all uniformly . The difference between expanded and non-expanded S/L ratios might also result from an underestimation of the small diameter due to a minor tilting along the long diameter in ‘en face’ views of expanded CEs , which are more difficult to obtain because of their larger size . ( In contrast to adult animals , ‘en face’ views are harder to obtain in larval zebrafish because the diameter of the CE contact in larvae is comparable to the diameter of the lateral dendrite of the M-cell [Yao et al . , 2014] , which , together with the presence of a smaller number of these afferents in larvae , makes ‘en face’ views less likely to be found and measured . ) Together , with our synaptic alignment findings ( see below ) , these results show that the expansion procedure had minimal effects on synaptic structure . Thus , expansion of these single synapses resulted in a more than tenfold increase of the synaptic contact area , allowing for a more detailed visualization of the relative distribution of its synaptic components . CEs combine electrical with chemical transmission . To investigate the area occupied by each form of transmission , we labeled for Cx35 . 5 as a marker of GJs and glutamate receptor 2 ( GluR2 ) as a marker of glutamatergic transmission ( Figure 2A–C ) . As expected , colocalization analysis ( Manders’ coefficient analysis ) revealed that labeling for Cx35 . 5 and GluR2 was mutually exclusive ( Figure 2D ) . Yet , while Cx35 . 5 labeling covered the majority of the area , labeling for GluR2 was substantially lower and limited to the contact’s peripheral margin ( Figure 2A–C ) . To quantify this differential distribution , we defined two regions of interest ( ROIs ) at ‘en face’ views of the CE contact: a central , oval ROI representing ¾ of the area ( ‘center’ ) and an annular ROI representing the peripheral , remaining ¼ of the area ( ‘periphery’ ) . Estimates of the relative intensity of Cx35 . 5 vs . GluR2 in each ROI showed that , while GluR2 is constrained to the periphery , Cx35 . 5 is homogeneously distributed through the contact area ( Figure 2E and F; see figure legend and ‘Materials and methods’ section for statistical analysis ) . This distribution is consistent with previous EM reconstruction of CEs in adult goldfish ( Tuttle et al . , 1986 ) , at which specializations for transmitter release were found to be restricted to the periphery of the contact . Thus , while GJs occupy most of the surface , chemical transmission occupies a smaller and peripheral portion , suggesting that most of the contact operates as an electrical synapse . Rather than diffusely distributed , labeling for Cx35 . 5 in expansion samples was characterized by well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact area , suggesting that they each might represent an individual GJ plaque . Consistent with this interpretation , double labeling for Cx35 . 5 and Cx34 . 1 ( Figure 3A and C ) showed a high degree of colocalization at CE contact areas ( Figure 3E ) . A high degree of colocalization ( Figure 3B and D , Figure 3—video 1 ) was also found between labeling for Cx35 . 5 and ZO1 ( Figure 3F; see figure legend for statistical analysis ) . Moreover , labeling for Cx35 . 5 and Cx34 . 1 colocalized at single puncta , as indicated by line scan of individual puncta . Given the characteristic concavity of the CE contact area , the relationship between labeled pre- and postsynaptic GJ proteins ( Figure 4A ) was easier to establish and accurately measure at the periphery of the labeled areas ( Figure 4B ) . Line scan of samples labeled for Cx35 . 5 and Cx34 . 1 indicated the presence of labeling for these proteins at single punctum ( Figure 4C ) . Strikingly , while the peak of maximum intensity for the pre-and postsynaptic connexins was aligned ( Figure 4C ) , the peak of maximum intensity for Cx35 . 5 always preceded that of ZO1 ( Figure 4D ) . This is consistent with the fact that , while Cx35 . 5 is presynaptically localized , ZO1b , one of the two zebrafish orthologs of ZO1 , was reported to be postsynaptic . The observed distance between the peaks of fluorescence was not due to the differences in the wavelength of the fluorophores due to uncompensated chromatic aberration as it remained when secondary antibodies were swapped ( Figure 4D and E ) . These differences are quantified in the graph of Figure 4F ( see figure legend for statistical analysis ) . The finding confirms previous conclusions reached with biochemical and chimera analysis indicating that ZO1b is only located at postsynaptic hemiplaques ( Lasseigne et al . , 2021 ) . Although a distance between Cx35 . 5 and Cx34 . 1 labeling peaks was observed in some samples ( ~0 . 15 µm ) , it was still too small to be consistently detected with this method due to the spatial amplification produced by the fluorophores . By increasing the distance between pre- and postsynaptic sites , expansion increases resolution , making it possible to explore differences in the composition of GJ hemiplaques . Thus , altogether , our findings indicate that each puncta correlates to a GJ . Puncta labeled for Cx35 . 5 ( Figure 5A and B ) , which we established each represent a GJ , showed a high degree of variability in number and size ( see inset of Figure 5C ) . We then quantified the number of puncta and their individual area in ‘en face’ views of CEs , at which this analysis was possible . ( Panels B and C in Figure 5 are the same experiment as Figures 1E and 3B and C , illustrating the ability of expansion microscopy for providing multiple layers of information within the same experiment . ) Figure 5D illustrates the variability in puncta area observed between neighboring CEs within the same M-cell lateral dendrite in three different fish . Histograms show a similar variability in number and size at all terminals . Overall , the number of GJs per CE averaged 36 . 73 ± 1 . 287 ( n = 11 CEs from four fish ) , and their area ranged from 0 . 06 to 1 . 99 µm2 . The number of GJs might have been slightly underestimated because fluorophore spatial amplification could have caused a big punctum to form from two closely spaced small GJs . This limitation could result in two nearby GJs appearing to merge . After correcting for the expansion factor ( 13× ) , the areas of the GJs were estimated to be between 4 and 148 nm2 . Assuming that connexons in GJ plaques are organized in a crystalline fashion with a density of 12 , 000 connexons/µm2 ( Kamasawa et al . , 2006 ) , we estimated that GJs at CEs contain 49–1775 connexons , and the total junctional area represents an average of 12 , 425 ± 493 . 76 connexons per CE . Thus , electrical transmission at zebrafish CEs is mediated by multiple GJs containing a variable number of channels . Our labeling with Cx35 . 5 and GluR2 showed that most of the contact area of a CE operates as an electrical synapse . We then asked what other associated anatomical structures might be contributing to electrical transmission . Previous electron microscopy analysis exposed the presence of AJs in close proximity to neuronal GJs , including those at CEs in goldfish and larval zebrafish ( Figure 6A ) . AJs are known to initiate and mediate the maturation and maintenance of cell–cell contacts , including GJs , at which a wealth of evidence suggests a close functional interaction ( Shaw et al . , 2007; Defourny and Thiry , 2021; Thomas et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , we decided to investigate the incidence , association , and spatial distribution between these two structures at CEs . Recent immunohistochemical analysis revealed the association between components of AJs and Cx36 in various mammalian structures ( Nagy and Lynn , 2018 ) . Expansion for Cx35 . 5 , transmembrane protein N-cadherin , and the intracellular protein ß-catenin , the latter two being major structural components of AJs , showed that labeling for AJs components seems equally distributed through the synaptic contact ( Figure 6B–D ) . In contrast to Cx35 . 5 , which is characterized by well-defined puncta reminiscent of GJs , labeling for N-cadherin and ß-catenin was diffuse , less structured , and did not colocalize with Cx35 . 5 ( Figure 6B; see figure legend for statistical analysis ) . Rather , the labeling for N-cadherin ( Figure 6C ) and ß-catenin ( Figure 6E ) was interleaved with Cx35 . 5 puncta , as illustrated by line scan analysis in the margins of CE contacts ( Figure 6D and F ) . Furthermore , in ‘en face’ views , labeling for N-cadherin ( Figure 6G ) and ß-catenin ( Figure 6H ) was broadly distributed throughout the surface of the contact , appearing to engulf Cx35 . 5-labeled puncta . While labeling for N-cadherin and ß-catenin was interleaved with Cx35 . 5 labeling , we observed some degree of colocalization ( Figure 6B ) likely due to fluorophore amplification of the close spatial association between GJs and AJs ( see Figure 6A ) . The spatial distribution of the labeling for components of AJs suggests that their function is associated with electrical transmission , rather than chemical transmission . To establish this association , we measured the relative proportion of labeling fluorescence of various synaptic components at CE contact areas . As expected , labeling for Cx35 . 5 and the GJ scaffold ZO1 was equally proportional ( Figure 7A ) . Similar proportionality was found for fluorescence of N-cadherin and Cx35 . 5 , and ß-catenin and Cx35 . 5 ( Figure 7B ) . In contrast , fluorescence of GluR2 represented a smaller fraction than that of Cx35 . 5 labeling ( Figure 7C; see figure legend for statistical analysis ) . Finally , we normalized the fluorescence to the area of the CE contact to calculate the area occupancy for these three synaptic structures ( Figure 7D ) . Less than 19% was occupied by GluR2 , while around 73% of the contact was occupied by similar amounts of Cx35 . 5 and AJs . About 8% of the contact area was not labeled for these antibodies , either corresponding to the surface membrane between the structures recognized by labeling or to the presence of additional synaptic components . Thus , while chemical synapses are restricted to a small and peripheral area of the contact , most of the contact surface is occupied by multiple GJs of variable size which are interleaved and closely associated to AJs ( Figure 7E ) . \n Because of their identifiability , CEs have historically been amenable for exploring synaptic structure and function with novel technical approaches . Here we applied expansion microscopy to these terminals , which allowed us to generate a ‘map’ of the distribution of its various synaptic proteins . We found that most of the contact area of a CE operates as an electrical synapse and only a peripheral ~19% is dedicated to chemical transmission . The 4× diameter increase after expansion represented a 13× increase of the oval contact areas and did not alter the morphology of the terminals , as supported by ( 1 ) expansion reproduced the characteristic concavity of the CE synaptic contact area with the M-cell; ( 2 ) the spatial distribution of chemical vs . electrical synaptic areas was consistent with that observed by electron microscopy in adult goldfish ( Tuttle et al . , 1986 ) and unexpanded zebrafish terminals Lasseigne et al . , 2021; ( 3 ) labeled puncta contain all the molecular components known to form GJs at CEs; ( 4 ) morphometric analysis indicated that the expansion process had no selective effects across the CE population; and ( 5 ) finally , consistent with this analysis , tissue expansion was tridimensional and exposed the expected pre- vs . postsynaptic localization of proteins at single punctum representing individual GJs . The properties of any ‘map’ are determined by the methodology that was employed to create it . While the sentence “The map is not the territory” was coined by Alfred Korzybski to metaphorically illustrate the distinction between brain perception and reality Korzybski , 1933 , it applies to the properties of maps in general and to the usefulness of applying expansion microscopy to expose the synaptic map of CE contacts . Moreover , any useful map should not necessarily be fully accurate ( discussed in “Of exactitude in science” by Borges , 1998 ) , but capable of capturing an element of reality . As a representation of reality , the labeling of molecules forming GJs , glutamate receptors , and AJs allowed us to expose the incidence and spatial distribution of the various synaptic components with enough accuracy to provide an ‘analogous structure’ of the contact’s structural organization . Expansion microscopy is complementary to a different representation of reality , electron microscopy , which is capable of providing fine details of the structures , but can inform , to a lesser degree , their biochemical composition . Unlike the more labor-intensive electron microscopy , expansion microscopy was more easily capable of exposing the complete contact area of the terminal , while additionally revealing its biochemical composition ( i . e . , because of its bias toward exposing intramembrane particles , freeze fracture EM of CEs did not reveal additional synaptic components between GJs; Yao et al . , 2014; Tuttle et al . , 1986; Kohno and Noguchi , 1986; Pereda et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , without having its structural resolution , expansion microscopy was able to expose , with sufficient resolution , a complementary version of spatial features that were only observed so far with electron microscopy . Furthermore , because of its tridimensional nature , expansion microscopy not only enlarged the synaptic contact area , but also the distance between synaptic elements , particularly enhancing the detection of pre- vs . postsynaptic components at GJs . Ultrastructural images and the bilateral requirement of GJ hemichannels convey the perception that GJs are symmetrically organized structures . Emerging evidence obtained at CEs suggests otherwise . Recent data indicates that GJ asymmetry at CEs is not only restricted to the connexin composition of pre- and postsynaptic hemichannels , but also to scaffolding molecules ( Lasseigne et al . , 2021; Martin et al . , 2023; Miller et al . , 2017; Rash et al . , 2013; Miller et al . , 2015 ) . That is , biochemical data and chimera analysis suggested that ZO1b , one of the two zebrafish orthologs of ZO1 whose function is critical for the presence of connexins at electrical synapses , is located in the postsynaptic hemiplaque from where it exerts its critical function ( Lasseigne et al . , 2021 ) . Confirming this conclusion , our expansion microscopy unambiguously exposed the postsynaptic location of ZO1b . Moreover , because the antibody recognizes both ZO1b and ZO1a , our data indicates that , although with different functions , both ZO1 orthologs might be restricted to postsynaptic hemiplaques . Together with the genetic accessibility of zebrafish , the synaptic map of CEs provided by expansion microscopy will facilitate exploring the functional relationship between the structures supporting electrical transmission and its regulation at each side of the junction . Electron microscopy of CEs in both adult goldfish and larval zebrafish revealed the presence of AJs in the vicinity of GJs ( Kohno and Noguchi , 1986; Kimmel et al . , 1981 ) , an association which was also observed at neuronal GJs in viper cerebellum ( Sotelo , 1977 ) and cat inferior olive ( Sotelo et al . , 1974 ) . AJs are dynamic cell–cell adhesion complexes that are continuously assembled and disassembled . They are formed by a complex of proteins that include cadherins and catenins ( ß and α ) . Growing evidence indicates a functional relationship between AJs and GJs ( Shaw et al . , 2007; Meyer et al . , 1992; Li et al . , 2005; Wei et al . , 2005; Dalva et al . , 2007 ) . While it was generally accepted that GJs form via lateral diffusion of hemichannels following microtubule-mediated delivery to the plasma membrane , more recent evidence obtained in cell expression systems shows that microtubules actually tether to the AJ , facilitating delivery of vesicles containing connexin hemichannels directly to the cell–cell border of the GJ ( Shaw et al . , 2007 ) . This process depends on the interaction of microtubules with plus-end-tracking protein ( +TIP ) EB1 , its interacting protein p150 ( Glued ) , and the AJ proteins N-cadherin and ß-catenin ( Shaw et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , the evidence indicates that this process also requires homophilic interactions between N-cadherins . Similar peripheral delivery of GJ channels to AJs was observed in sensory epithelial cells of the cochlea ( Defourny and Thiry , 2021 ) , indicating that this mechanism also operates in tissues . Also consistent with a close functional relationship between these structures , AJ formation hierarchically regulates the formation of GJs in cardiac pacemaker cells ( Thomas et al . , 2021 ) , adjusting the excitability and coupling of these neurons in the context of their pacemaking function . The investigation of the mechanisms and structures underlying electrical transmission has generally centered on the properties of GJ channels and their supporting molecules , a perspective that is restricted to a mechanisms occurring at a single GJ plaque . However , electrical transmission at each zebrafish CE terminal is mediated on average by about 35 GJs , suggesting that they together operate as a functional unit . Like chemical synapses that operate with dramatically different numbers of releases sites , ranging from a single one at synaptic terminals of PHP cells on the M-cell ( Korn et al . , 1982; Korn et al . , 1981 ) to up to 700 in the Calyx of Held ( Sätzler et al . , 2002; Taschenberger et al . , 2002 ) , electrical synapses could function with different number of GJs . Operating with multiple GJs might result in more reliable electrical transmission as only a very small fraction of channels are known to be functional at individual GJs ( Flores et al . , 2012; Curti et al . , 2012; Szoboszlay et al . , 2016; Marandykina et al . , 2013 ) . Because of the wide variation in size , GJs at CEs might coexist at different states of conductance ( Bukauskas et al . , 2000 ) . The presence of multiple GJs of different sizes might be reflective of high plastic regulation , a possibility consistent with the dynamic properties of CE electrical synapses , which are known to undergo activity-dependent potentiation of their synaptic strength ( Yang et al . , 1990; Pereda and Faber , 1996; Pereda et al . , 1998; Cachope et al . , 2007 ) . While it is currently unknown how regulation of the overall conductance of the CE electrical synapse is achieved , it must necessarily result from the coordinated contribution of its multiple GJs , suggesting the need of additional synaptic structures capable of coordinating the function of the numerous GJs . Given the close spatial association that we report here , it is tempting to speculate that interactions between AJs and GJs could underlie such function . Since interactions between GJs and AJs involving cadherins are thought to be relevant for the insertion of new GJ channels ( Defourny and Thiry , 2021; Shaw et al . , 2007 ) , this process might be intimately related to the maintenance and plasticity of GJ communication via regulated turnover of these channels at CEs , which are formed by fish homologs of Cx36 ( Rash et al . , 2013; Miller and Pereda , 2017 ) . Consistent with the possibility of AJs promoting the insertion of new GJ channels at CEs , microfilaments arriving to an AJ situated in close proximity to a GJ can be observed in an image of the EM study by Kohno and Naguchi ( see Figure 2 in Kohno and Noguchi , 1986 ) . Operating with multiple GJs also provides electrical synapses with the possibility of either silencing or activating individual GJs as a potential additional mechanism of strength regulation . Finally , although N-cadherin was also shown to be involved in regulating chemical synapses ( Korn et al . , 1981 ) , the distribution of chemical synapses to small peripheral areas of the CE contact indicates a primary functional role of this molecule at electrical synapses as both GJ proteins and N-cadherin are similarly distributed throughout the entire synaptic contact area . Future investigations on the functional association between GJs and AJs will shed light on the functional organization of electrical synapses . The structural complexity of chemical synapses has long been recognized . Structural complexity is also a hallmark of immunological synapses ( Dustin , 2014 ) , specialized functional contacts which quickly assemble between a thymus-derived lymphocyte and an antigen-presenting cell ( Dustin , 2012; Dustin and Groves , 2012 ) . Both chemical and immunological synapses share a general molecular organization combining cell adhesion molecules , usually restricted to the periphery of the contacts , with those more centrally located and responsible for providing intercellular communication ( Dustin and Colman , 2002 ) . Our results indicate that this structural arrangement might also apply to the CE electrical synapse . That is , our finding that AJs surround GJs all through the contact is consistent with the general organization of chemical and immunological synapses , at which adhesion molecules are located in the periphery of the communicating mechanism . Thus , just as chemical and immunological synapses , electrical synapses also seem to combine cell adhesion molecules with those responsible for mediating intercellular communication . Based on these similarities in the overall organization across synapses and evidence of functional interactions with GJs ( see above ) , we propose that AJs could be considered components of electrical synapses . While additional components are likely to contribute to electrical transmission , the distribution of adhesion molecules at electrical synapses might serve to define their synaptic boundary , an arrangement that might be used as a template to identify electrical synapses in other structures . Supporting this notion , a close association between components of AJs and Cx36 was observed at various mammalian brain structures ( Nagy and Lynn , 2018 ) and was suggested they share a common molecular complex ( Nagy and Lynn , 2018 ) . As in CEs , multiple Cx36-labeled puncta engulfed by N-cadherin labeling were also observed at cell–cell contacts between the somata of neurons of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminus in mice ( see Figure 8 in Nagy and Lynn , 2018 ) , indicating that this arrangement is not a unique feature of fish mixed synapses but might also apply to electrical synapses elsewhere . In summary , as single synaptic contact , expansion microscopy of CEs offered the possibility of identifying the structures that support electrical transmission and , therefore , the components that together form an electrical synapse , which can be used to define electrical synapses throughout animal connectomes . Moreover , defining the components of an electrical synapse will help expose their functional diversity as different synapses might operate with different numbers of GJs and synaptic arrangements . \n All experiments were performed in 5 dpf zebrafish , Danio rerio . Zebrafish were housed at the Department of Neuroscience zebrafish facility , bred and maintained at 28°C on a 14 hr light/10 hr dark cycle . Experiments were carried out in the Tol-056 enhancer trap line ( Satou et al . , 2009 ) . Zebrafish larvae were anesthetized with 0 . 03% MS-222 ( tricaine methanesulfonate ) and fixed for 3 hr with 2% trichloroacetic acid , in 1× PBS , at room temperature . Fixed samples were then washed three times with 1× PBS , followed by a brain dissection with the help of a custom-made tungsten needle and forceps . The needle was also used to remove the cerebellum , optic tectum , and telencephalon to accommodate for the working distance of the microscope objective . This step was not necessary in samples used for expansion methods . The dissected brains were washed with 1× PBS + 0 . 5% Triton X-100 ( PBS-Trx ) and blocked with 10% normal goat serum + 1% DMSO in PBS-Trx . Brains were then incubated with a primary antibody mix at room temperature overnight . The antibody mix , with block solution , included combinations of the following: rabbit anti-Cx35 . 5 ( Miller et al . , 2015 , clone 12H5 , 1:200 ) , mouse IgG1 anti-Cx35/36 , which labels both Cx35 . 5 and Cx35 . 1 ( Millipore , Cat# MAB3045 , 1:250 ) , mouse IgG2A anti-Cx34 . 1 ( Miller et al . , 2015 , clone 5C10A , 1:200 ) , mouse IgG1 anti-ZO1 ( Invitrogen , Cat# 33-9100 , 1:200 ) , mouse IgG1 anti-N-cadherin ( BD Transduction Laboratories , Cat# 610920 , 1:50 ) , mouse IgG1 anti-beta-catenin ( Sigma , Cat# C7207 , 1:100 ) , rabbit IgG anti-GluR2/3 ( Millipore , Cat# 07-598 , 1:200 ) , and chicken IgY anti-GFP ( Abcam , Cat# ab13970 , 1:200 ) . After three washes in PBS-Trx , brains were blocked with 10% normal goat serum + 1% DMSO in PBS-Trx , followed by incubation in secondary antibody mix at room temperature for 4 hr . Secondary antibody mixes included , in addition to block solution , combinations of mouse IgG- Alexa Fluor 546 ( Invitrogen , Cat# A11030 , 1:200 ) , mouse IgG- Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen , Cat# A21235 , 1:200 ) , rabbit IgG- Alexa Fluor 546 ( Invitrogen , Cat# A11010 , 1:200 ) , rabbit IgG- Atto 647N ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# 40839 , 1:200 ) , mouse IgG- Atto 647N ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# 50185 , 1:200 ) , and chicken IgY- Alexa Fluor 488 ( Invitrogen , Cat# A11039 , 1:200 ) . Samples were washed with 1× PBS four times and overnight at 4°C , and then transferred in the dark , onto a slide , and mounted with ProLong Gold antifade ( Invitrogen , Cat# P36930 ) . Finally , samples were covered using the ‘bridge’ procedure ( Martin et al . , 2022 ) and sealed with nail polish . Samples for the expansion procedure were not mounted as noted here; instead , the samples were incubated in anchoring solution ( see below ) overnight . Expansion of brain samples was performed following previous protocols ( Asano et al . , 2018 ) with additional modifications using the following reagents ( final concentrations are reported ) : anchoring solution: acryloyl-X , SE ( 0 . 01% ) and PBS ( 1× ) to a complete volume; monomer solution/gelling solution ( 4-HT , tetramethylethylenediamine [TEMED] , and ammonium persulfate ( APS ) should be added sequentially , one at a time , to each sample ) : acrylamide ( 2 . 5% ) , N , N’ methylenebisacrylamide ( 0 . 15% ) , NaCl ( 2 M ) , PBS ( 1× ) , sodium acrylate ( 8 . 6% ) , 4-hydroxy-TEMPO ( 4-HT ) ( 0 . 01% ) , TEMED ( 0 . 2% ) , APS ( 0 . 2% ) , and cell culture grade water to a complete volume; digestion buffer: Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) ( 50 mM ) , EDTA ( 1 mM ) , Triton X-100 ( 0 . 5% ) , NaCl ( 0 . 5 M ) , and cell culture grade water to a complete volume; and proteinase K ( 8 units/ml ) . Upon completion of immunolabeling steps , the sample was incubated in anchoring solution overnight . The sample was then washed twice in 1× PBS and placed into monomer/gelling solution , and placed at 4°C for 50 min , and then at 37°C for 2 hr . Once the hydrogel polymerized , the sample was placed at 50°C for 12 hr in the digestion buffer + proteinase K . Samples were then washed five times with cell culture grade water for expansion . Following this procedure , the hydrogels were imaged with the confocal microscope . All images were acquired on LSM 710 and LSM 880 Zeiss microscopes using the following laser wavelengths: argon 458/488/514 , HeNe 543 , and HeNe 633 , along with the corresponding filter: MBS 488/543/633 , MBS 458/543 , MBS 488/543/633 , using either a ×40 1 . 0 NA water immersion objective or a ×63 1 . 40 NA oil immersion objective . Confocal settings were adjusted to achieve maximum visualization of labeling at CE contact areas . Both lateral and ‘en face’ views of expanded CE contact areas were used for quantitative analysis . The lateral and axial resolutions of our system were estimated following the microscope specifications ( Wilhelm et al . , 2010 ) . We estimated the lateral and axial resolutions of our microscope ( Wilhelm et al . , 2010 ) to range between 248 . 9 to 322 nm and 429 . 44 to 557 . 04 nm , respectively , depending on the excitation wavelength used ( 488 , 543 , 633 ) . After correcting for the linear expansion factor ( 3 . 9× ) , the lateral and axial resolutions after expansion are expected to range between 63 . 81 to 82 . 77 nm and 110 . 11 to 142 . 83 nm , respectively . Confocal images were obtained using ZEN ( black edition ) software and analyzed with FIJI . The scale bars in the figures represent actual dimensions , and , therefore , ProExM images have not been adjusted for expansion factor . Contrast and brightness of fluorescence channels were individually adjusted and contrasted in Photoshop ( Adobe ) using blur and sharpen filters . Nonetheless , quantitative analysis of image fluorescence was carried out using raw data . Colocalization analysis was performed in FIJI ( https://imagej . net/imaging/colocalization-analysis ) using the JACoP plugin ( https://imagej . net/plugins/jacop , which uses pixel-wise methodology to determine matching pixels between channels ) . After selecting ROIs of the oval CE contact areas , colocalization for each image was quantified using the Manders’ coefficient ( Bolte and Cordelières , 2006; Zinchuk et al . , 2007 ) . This coefficient expresses the proportion of fluorescence in one channel that colocalizes with the proportion of fluorescence in the second channel , and vice versa ( Manders et al . , 1993 ) . The analysis allowed for setting independent thresholds for each channel to account for different levels of fluorescent intensity and generate colocalization coefficients whose values range from 0 to 1 . To quantify the differential distribution of GluR2 and Cx35 . 5 labeling ( Figure 2 ) , we defined two ROIs at ‘en face’ views of the CE contact: a central oval ROI representing ¾ of the area ( ‘center’ ) and an annular ROI representing the peripheral remaining ¼ ( ‘periphery’ ) . To estimate the surface area covered by GluR2 or Cx35 . 5 labeling , we determined the fluorescence intensity of each channel for both the central and peripheral ROIs and obtained the ‘area integrated intensity’ ( sum of the pixel intensity over all of the pixels in the ROI ) . Background was then subtracted using the Correct Total Cell Fluorescence [CTCF = Integrated Density – ( Selected area . Background mean fluorescence ) ] . For statistical comparison , CTCF values in the ‘center’ and ‘periphery’ ROIs were normalized to the highest values in each case , which , because of their differential distribution , in most of the cases were Cx35 . 5 in the center and GluR2 in the periphery . Statistical comparison was performed using Student’s t-test . The area of occupancy of the labeling for different synaptic proteins was performed in FIJI using the protocol developed by Jacqueline Ross ( University of Auckland , New Zealand ) . After selecting an ROI of the oval CE contact area , the procedure identifies fluorescent patches to then calculate the total labeled area for each florescence channel ( for more details on this method , please see here ) . For estimates of Cx35 . 5 puncta area ( Figure 5 and related text ) , each punctum was manually defined as an ROI , and the distribution of the estimated area values was plotted as frequency histograms ( the number of bins was selected using Sturge’s rule ) .",

         "Most nervous systems combine both transmitter-mediated and direct cell–cell communication , known as ‘chemical’ and ‘electrical’ synapses , respectively . Electrical synapses are , on the other hand , generally defined by the presence of a ‘gap junction’  between two neuronal processes . We investigated this question at identifiable single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells , at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release and where the contact unequivocally defines the anatomical limits of a synapse . Expansion microscopy of these single contacts revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures . In contrast , glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact , indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse . Thus , our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one , but multiple gap junctions , in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions . The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses . The exchange of information can occur directly through cell–cell channels , known as ‘electrical synapses’ , or indirectly , via the release of a chemical messenger , known as ‘chemical synapses’  . While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses with structurally distinct pre- and postsynaptic components has long been recognized  , less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses . Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as ‘gap junctions’   . While GJs are ubiquitous and present in virtually every tissue of the organism providing metabolic coupling  , they additionally serve as a pathway of low resistance for the spread of electrical currents between neurons  , the main form of signaling in the brain , which is fast enough to operate within the time frame required for decision-making by neural circuits  . Electrical synapses are generally perceived as structurally simpler than chemical synapses and exclusively involving the function of intercellular channels . However , recent data indicates that the function of these channels is under the control of their supporting molecular scaffold  , suggesting that neuronal GJs are complex molecular structures whose function requires the contribution of multiple molecular components  . Thus far , investigations of the properties of vertebrate electrical transmission have solely considered the functional properties of the channel-forming proteins , the connexins , the molecules that regulate them , and their interactions at the GJ plaque . In contrast , neuronal GJs are typically found connecting cell somata or other neuronal processes  , such as dendrites and axons , making it more difficult to define the exact anatomical boundaries that constitute an electrical synapse . Neuronal GJs can also occur at synaptic boutons , generally coexisting with specializations for chemical transmission  . This is the case for auditory afferents terminating as single ‘large myelinated club endings’  or ‘club endings’  on the lateral dendrite of the teleost Mauthner cells   , each containing GJs and specializations for chemical transmission  . Because of their experimental accessibly and functional properties , these terminals are considered a valuable model to study vertebrate electrical transmission as they more easily allow for the correlation between structure and function of synaptic features  . Since the bouton marks the anatomical limits of a synapse , these contacts offer the opportunity to examine the anatomical structures that together make an electrical synapse . Here , we used expansion microscopy  to expose the presence and spatial arrangement of synaptic components in CEs of larval zebrafish . CEs from larval zebrafish share comparable morphological and functional properties with those of adult fish  , and due to their genetic accessibility , allow for the opportunity to investigate the functional link between the structures enabling electrical transmission and its regulation . Expansion revealed the presence of multiple well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact area , which , consistent with the notion that they represent GJ plaques , each exhibited labeling for the fish homologs of the widespread mammalian connexin 36  , Cx35 , and Cx34 , as well as for the GJ scaffolding protein zonula occludens   . Strikingly , expansion following staining with N-cadherin and ß-catenin antibodies , protein components of ‘adherens junctions’  , showed that these proteins are also distributed all throughout the contact area , but in a fashion that is mutually exclusive with connexin . Finally , double labeling with Cx and glutamate receptor antibodies showed that , while GJs are distributed throughout the entire contact area , a much smaller number of glutamatergic sites are restricted to the periphery occupying a small fraction  of the contact’s surface . Thus , our data suggest that synaptic communication at electrical synapses results from not one but the coordinated action of multiple GJs of variable size , which may require the functional contribution of additional structures , such as AJs . Because of their unusual large size and experimental accessibility , CEs represent a valued model for the correlation of synaptic structure and function . Ultrastructural analysis of CEs in adult goldfish  and larval zebrafish  revealed the presence of GJs coexisting with specializations for neurotransmitter release . Consistent with these synaptic specializations , stimulation of CEs evokes a synaptic response that combines electrical and chemical transmission  . A wealth of evidence indicates that GJs at these terminals consist of heterotypic intercellular channels created by the apposition of a presynaptic hemichannel formed by connexin Cx35 . 1 , two of the Cx35  and Cx34  orthologs  . The synaptic contact areas of CEs  can be visualized and unambiguously identified by immunolabeling for these GJ proteins , which are revealed as large fluorescent oval areas at the distal portion of the lateral dendrite of the M-cell  . We combined this approach with a protein-retention expansion microscopy protocol  to explore not only the presence but the relative distribution of the structures formed by various synaptic proteins throughout the contact areas of CEs in 5 days post fertilization  zebrafish . 5-positive puncta at these contacts forming a concave oval area  , reminiscent of that observed at goldfish CEs , known to correspond to GJ plaques  . The main diameter of the oval synaptic contact area defined by labeling of Cx35 . 5 , either using anti-Cx35/36  or a specific anti-Cx35 . Therefore , to determine the degree of isotropy of the expansion , we measured the ratio between the short and long diameters of the CE oval areas  in non- and post-expanded samples . The difference between expanded and non-expanded S/L ratios might also result from an underestimation of the small diameter due to a minor tilting along the long diameter in ‘en face’ views of expanded CEs , which are more difficult to obtain because of their larger size . Thus , expansion of these single synapses resulted in a more than tenfold increase of the synaptic contact area , allowing for a more detailed visualization of the relative distribution of its synaptic components . CEs combine electrical with chemical transmission . To investigate the area occupied by each form of transmission , we labeled for Cx35 . To quantify this differential distribution , we defined two regions of interest  at ‘en face’ views of the CE contact: a central , oval ROI representing ¾ of the area  and an annular ROI representing the peripheral , remaining ¼ of the area  . This distribution is consistent with previous EM reconstruction of CEs in adult goldfish  , at which specializations for transmitter release were found to be restricted to the periphery of the contact . Thus , while GJs occupy most of the surface , chemical transmission occupies a smaller and peripheral portion , suggesting that most of the contact operates as an electrical synapse . 5 in expansion samples was characterized by well-defined puncta distributed throughout the contact area , suggesting that they each might represent an individual GJ plaque . 1  showed a high degree of colocalization at CE contact areas  . Given the characteristic concavity of the CE contact area , the relationship between labeled pre- and postsynaptic GJ proteins  was easier to establish and accurately measure at the periphery of the labeled areas  . We then quantified the number of puncta and their individual area in ‘en face’ views of CEs , at which this analysis was possible . Figure 5D illustrates the variability in puncta area observed between neighboring CEs within the same M-cell lateral dendrite in three different fish . Overall , the number of GJs per CE averaged 36 . The number of GJs might have been slightly underestimated because fluorophore spatial amplification could have caused a big punctum to form from two closely spaced small GJs . After correcting for the expansion factor  , the areas of the GJs were estimated to be between 4 and 148 nm2 . Assuming that connexons in GJ plaques are organized in a crystalline fashion with a density of 12 , 000 connexons/µm2  , we estimated that GJs at CEs contain 49–1775 connexons , and the total junctional area represents an average of 12 , 425 ± 493 . Thus , electrical transmission at zebrafish CEs is mediated by multiple GJs containing a variable number of channels . 5 and GluR2 showed that most of the contact area of a CE operates as an electrical synapse . Previous electron microscopy analysis exposed the presence of AJs in close proximity to neuronal GJs , including those at CEs in goldfish and larval zebrafish  . AJs are known to initiate and mediate the maturation and maintenance of cell–cell contacts , including GJs , at which a wealth of evidence suggests a close functional interaction  . Recent immunohistochemical analysis revealed the association between components of AJs and Cx36 in various mammalian structures  . 5 , transmembrane protein N-cadherin , and the intracellular protein ß-catenin , the latter two being major structural components of AJs , showed that labeling for AJs components seems equally distributed through the synaptic contact  . 5 , which is characterized by well-defined puncta reminiscent of GJs , labeling for N-cadherin and ß-catenin was diffuse , less structured , and did not colocalize with Cx35 . Furthermore , in ‘en face’ views , labeling for N-cadherin  and ß-catenin  was broadly distributed throughout the surface of the contact , appearing to engulf Cx35 . 5 labeling , we observed some degree of colocalization  likely due to fluorophore amplification of the close spatial association between GJs and AJs  . The spatial distribution of the labeling for components of AJs suggests that their function is associated with electrical transmission , rather than chemical transmission . To establish this association , we measured the relative proportion of labeling fluorescence of various synaptic components at CE contact areas . Finally , we normalized the fluorescence to the area of the CE contact to calculate the area occupancy for these three synaptic structures  . Less than 19% was occupied by GluR2 , while around 73% of the contact was occupied by similar amounts of Cx35 . About 8% of the contact area was not labeled for these antibodies , either corresponding to the surface membrane between the structures recognized by labeling or to the presence of additional synaptic components . Thus , while chemical synapses are restricted to a small and peripheral area of the contact , most of the contact surface is occupied by multiple GJs of variable size which are interleaved and closely associated to AJs  . We found that most of the contact area of a CE operates as an electrical synapse and only a peripheral ~19% is dedicated to chemical transmission . The 4× diameter increase after expansion represented a 13× increase of the oval contact areas and did not alter the morphology of the terminals , as supported by  expansion reproduced the characteristic concavity of the CE synaptic contact area with the M-cell;  the spatial distribution of chemical vs . electrical synaptic areas was consistent with that observed by electron microscopy in adult goldfish  and unexpanded zebrafish terminals Lasseigne et al . , 2021;  labeled puncta contain all the molecular components known to form GJs at CEs;  morphometric analysis indicated that the expansion process had no selective effects across the CE population; and  finally , consistent with this analysis , tissue expansion was tridimensional and exposed the expected pre- vs . While the sentence “The map is not the territory” was coined by Alfred Korzybski to metaphorically illustrate the distinction between brain perception and reality Korzybski , 1933 , it applies to the properties of maps in general and to the usefulness of applying expansion microscopy to expose the synaptic map of CE contacts . As a representation of reality , the labeling of molecules forming GJs , glutamate receptors , and AJs allowed us to expose the incidence and spatial distribution of the various synaptic components with enough accuracy to provide an ‘analogous structure’ of the contact’s structural organization . Unlike the more labor-intensive electron microscopy , expansion microscopy was more easily capable of exposing the complete contact area of the terminal , while additionally revealing its biochemical composition  . Furthermore , because of its tridimensional nature , expansion microscopy not only enlarged the synaptic contact area , but also the distance between synaptic elements , particularly enhancing the detection of pre- vs . Ultrastructural images and the bilateral requirement of GJ hemichannels convey the perception that GJs are symmetrically organized structures . Recent data indicates that GJ asymmetry at CEs is not only restricted to the connexin composition of pre- and postsynaptic hemichannels , but also to scaffolding molecules  . That is , biochemical data and chimera analysis suggested that ZO1b , one of the two zebrafish orthologs of ZO1 whose function is critical for the presence of connexins at electrical synapses , is located in the postsynaptic hemiplaque from where it exerts its critical function  . Moreover , because the antibody recognizes both ZO1b and ZO1a , our data indicates that , although with different functions , both ZO1 orthologs might be restricted to postsynaptic hemiplaques . Together with the genetic accessibility of zebrafish , the synaptic map of CEs provided by expansion microscopy will facilitate exploring the functional relationship between the structures supporting electrical transmission and its regulation at each side of the junction . Electron microscopy of CEs in both adult goldfish and larval zebrafish revealed the presence of AJs in the vicinity of GJs  , an association which was also observed at neuronal GJs in viper cerebellum  and cat inferior olive  . While it was generally accepted that GJs form via lateral diffusion of hemichannels following microtubule-mediated delivery to the plasma membrane , more recent evidence obtained in cell expression systems shows that microtubules actually tether to the AJ , facilitating delivery of vesicles containing connexin hemichannels directly to the cell–cell border of the GJ  . Similar peripheral delivery of GJ channels to AJs was observed in sensory epithelial cells of the cochlea  , indicating that this mechanism also operates in tissues . Also consistent with a close functional relationship between these structures , AJ formation hierarchically regulates the formation of GJs in cardiac pacemaker cells  , adjusting the excitability and coupling of these neurons in the context of their pacemaking function . The investigation of the mechanisms and structures underlying electrical transmission has generally centered on the properties of GJ channels and their supporting molecules , a perspective that is restricted to a mechanisms occurring at a single GJ plaque . However , electrical transmission at each zebrafish CE terminal is mediated on average by about 35 GJs , suggesting that they together operate as a functional unit . Like chemical synapses that operate with dramatically different numbers of releases sites , ranging from a single one at synaptic terminals of PHP cells on the M-cell  to up to 700 in the Calyx of Held  , electrical synapses could function with different number of GJs . Operating with multiple GJs might result in more reliable electrical transmission as only a very small fraction of channels are known to be functional at individual GJs  . Because of the wide variation in size , GJs at CEs might coexist at different states of conductance  . The presence of multiple GJs of different sizes might be reflective of high plastic regulation , a possibility consistent with the dynamic properties of CE electrical synapses , which are known to undergo activity-dependent potentiation of their synaptic strength  . While it is currently unknown how regulation of the overall conductance of the CE electrical synapse is achieved , it must necessarily result from the coordinated contribution of its multiple GJs , suggesting the need of additional synaptic structures capable of coordinating the function of the numerous GJs . Given the close spatial association that we report here , it is tempting to speculate that interactions between AJs and GJs could underlie such function . Since interactions between GJs and AJs involving cadherins are thought to be relevant for the insertion of new GJ channels  , this process might be intimately related to the maintenance and plasticity of GJ communication via regulated turnover of these channels at CEs , which are formed by fish homologs of Cx36  . Consistent with the possibility of AJs promoting the insertion of new GJ channels at CEs , microfilaments arriving to an AJ situated in close proximity to a GJ can be observed in an image of the EM study by Kohno and Naguchi  . Operating with multiple GJs also provides electrical synapses with the possibility of either silencing or activating individual GJs as a potential additional mechanism of strength regulation . Finally , although N-cadherin was also shown to be involved in regulating chemical synapses  , the distribution of chemical synapses to small peripheral areas of the CE contact indicates a primary functional role of this molecule at electrical synapses as both GJ proteins and N-cadherin are similarly distributed throughout the entire synaptic contact area . Future investigations on the functional association between GJs and AJs will shed light on the functional organization of electrical synapses . Both chemical and immunological synapses share a general molecular organization combining cell adhesion molecules , usually restricted to the periphery of the contacts , with those more centrally located and responsible for providing intercellular communication  . Our results indicate that this structural arrangement might also apply to the CE electrical synapse . That is , our finding that AJs surround GJs all through the contact is consistent with the general organization of chemical and immunological synapses , at which adhesion molecules are located in the periphery of the communicating mechanism . Thus , just as chemical and immunological synapses , electrical synapses also seem to combine cell adhesion molecules with those responsible for mediating intercellular communication . Based on these similarities in the overall organization across synapses and evidence of functional interactions with GJs  , we propose that AJs could be considered components of electrical synapses . While additional components are likely to contribute to electrical transmission , the distribution of adhesion molecules at electrical synapses might serve to define their synaptic boundary , an arrangement that might be used as a template to identify electrical synapses in other structures . Supporting this notion , a close association between components of AJs and Cx36 was observed at various mammalian brain structures  and was suggested they share a common molecular complex  . As in CEs , multiple Cx36-labeled puncta engulfed by N-cadherin labeling were also observed at cell–cell contacts between the somata of neurons of the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminus in mice  , indicating that this arrangement is not a unique feature of fish mixed synapses but might also apply to electrical synapses elsewhere . In summary , as single synaptic contact , expansion microscopy of CEs offered the possibility of identifying the structures that support electrical transmission and , therefore , the components that together form an electrical synapse , which can be used to define electrical synapses throughout animal connectomes . Moreover , defining the components of an electrical synapse will help expose their functional diversity as different synapses might operate with different numbers of GJs and synaptic arrangements . 5  , mouse IgG1 anti-Cx35/36 , which labels both Cx35 . 1  , mouse IgG1 anti-ZO1  , mouse IgG1 anti-N-cadherin  , mouse IgG1 anti-beta-catenin  , rabbit IgG anti-GluR2/3  , and chicken IgY anti-GFP  . Expansion of brain samples was performed following previous protocols  with additional modifications using the following reagents  : anchoring solution: acryloyl-X , SE  and PBS  to a complete volume; monomer solution/gelling solution ( 4-HT , tetramethylethylenediamine  , and ammonium persulfate  should be added sequentially , one at a time , to each sample ) : acrylamide  , N , N’ methylenebisacrylamide  , NaCl  , PBS  , sodium acrylate  , 4-hydroxy-TEMPO   , TEMED  , APS  , and cell culture grade water to a complete volume; digestion buffer: Tris   , EDTA  , Triton X-100  , NaCl  , and cell culture grade water to a complete volume; and proteinase K  . Confocal settings were adjusted to achieve maximum visualization of labeling at CE contact areas . Both lateral and ‘en face’ views of expanded CE contact areas were used for quantitative analysis . After selecting ROIs of the oval CE contact areas , colocalization for each image was quantified using the Manders’ coefficient  . 5 labeling  , we defined two ROIs at ‘en face’ views of the CE contact: a central oval ROI representing ¾ of the area  and an annular ROI representing the peripheral remaining ¼  . After selecting an ROI of the oval CE contact area , the procedure identifies fluorescent patches to then calculate the total labeled area for each florescence channel  . "

         "The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) , a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm , contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity . To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons , we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity , with minimal effects on breathing . These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states . The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity . We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons , based on their axonal projections , is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors . This is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases . \n Breathing is a complex behavior requiring the coordination of multiple motor patterns in the face , upper airways , thorax , and abdomen to enable gas exchange between the external and internal environment and maintenance of blood gas homeostasis ( Del Negro et al . , 2018 ) . Strict coordination of breathing with the activity of facial and upper airway muscles underlies the rhythmic orofacial behaviors , such as sniffing , sucking , licking , whisking , vocalization , and swallowing , which are fundamental for ingestive and exploratory behavior , and social interaction ( Deschênes et al . , 2016; Deschênes et al . , 2015; Huff et al . , 2022; Moore et al . , 2014; Takatoh et al . , 2022 ) . Breathing-related information permeates the brain with respiratory modulation of suprapontine brain structures affecting cognitive function and emotional expression ( Ashhad et al . , 2022; Lavretsky and Feldman PhD , 2021; Yackle et al . , 2017 ) . Similarly , coordination of this motor activity with autonomic nervous system activity produces phasic fluctuations of blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) that are essential for optimizing cardiac efficiency and organ blood flow ( Fisher et al . , 2022; Menuet et al . , 2020; O’Callaghan et al . , 2020; Shanks et al . , 2022 ) . The network of neurons coordinating breathing is distributed throughout the brainstem , with a major group responsible for generating inspiration located in the pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) within the ventrolateral medulla oblongata ( Smith et al . , 1991 ) . In rodents , the preBötC consists of a heterogeneous population of ~3000 neurons with distinct , but intermingled , excitatory and inhibitory subgroups ( Ashhad and Feldman , 2020; Del Negro et al . , 2018 ) . Anatomical studies showed that preBötC sends parallel excitatory and inhibitory projections to target nuclei throughout the brain , including to regions responsible for respiratory motor activity ( Yang and Feldman , 2018 ) . As indicated by their extensive projections , preBötC neurons modulate many circuits in addition to those required for breathing activity . For example , preBötC neurons project monosynaptically to key medullary centers for autonomic regulation , and modulate cardiorespiratory coupling ( Dempsey et al . , 2017; Menuet et al . , 2020; Menuet et al . , 2017 ) . Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea , but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity , reduces respiratory modulation of BP , and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia ( Menuet et al . , 2020 ) . Neurons in the preBötC also modulate orofacial behaviors . Activation of the developing brain homeobox1 ( Dbx1 ) -expressing preBötC neurons alters the networks responsible for the coordination of upper airways and swallowing , to decrease the probability of swallowing during inspiration ( Huff et al . , 2022 ) . The preBötC also contributes to motor patterns that are necessary for exploratory behaviors , such as sniffing and whisking . In this case , a group of inhibitory preBötC neurons provide monosynaptic inputs onto the vibrissal premotor neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus ( vIRt ) to facilitate synchronous whisking . In addition , preBötC contains facial premotor neurons that modulate nasal dilation and mystacial pad ( MP ) muscle activity to couple whisking to the breathing rhythm ( Deschênes et al . , 2016; Takatoh et al . , 2022 ) . Understanding and identifying the preBötC subgroups that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors has been associated with the development and progression of diseases ( El-Omar et al . , 2001; Huff et al . , 2022; Menuet et al . , 2017; Simms et al . , 2009 ) . Although several studies have attempted to understand the physiological function/s of each preBötC neuronal subpopulation , disturbances in breathing , that occur when preBötC neurons are either inhibited or activated , impact our understanding of whether the observed changes are due to the direct effects of preBötC neurons or alterations resulting from changes in the respiratory rhythm and blood gases ( Cui et al . , 2016; Huff et al . , 2022; Menuet et al . , 2020; Tan et al . , 2008; Yackle et al . , 2017 ) . Furthermore , whilst substantial gains have been made in understanding the expression of selective molecular markers in subgroups of preBötC neurons , it is rarely possible to reliably assign particular neurochemical signatures to unique functions ( Ashhad and Feldman , 2020; Del Negro et al . , 2018; Yackle et al . , 2017 ) . For example , while Dbx1+somatostatin ( SST ) + predominantly affect the breathing pattern ( Cui et al . , 2016; Del Negro et al . , 2018; Ashhad and Feldman , 2020 ) , some Dbx1+SST+ which also express the neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK1R ) and , in some cases , cadherin-9 ( Cdh9+ ) , promote generalized behavioral arousal ( Yackle et al . , 2017 ) . To further understand the organization of the preBötC , in this study , we have tested the hypothesis that the preBötC region is composed of segregated subgroups of output neurons , potentially driven by a separate group of rhythmogenic neurons , that modulate specific behaviors , such as orofacial muscle activity . If correct , we predict that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus ( 7n ) should modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity . To test this hypothesis , we utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing cre-recombinase ( Cre ) -dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel , GtACR2 , and another retrograde axonal delivery of Cre . We showed that selective transduction and photoinhibition of preBötC facial premotor neurons affects the MP activity while minimally affecting breathing . \n To evaluate whether distinct subgroups of preBötC neurons could be distinguished based on their axonal projections , retrograde adeno-associated viruses ( AAVrg ) , expressing either green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , or the red fluorophore , mCherry , were injected into 7n and the rostral ventrolateral medulla ( RVLM ) ( n=3 ) , respectively ( Figure 1A ) . Three weeks later , fluorophore expression was observed in preBötC neurons , with overlapping distribution ( Figure 1B ) , albeit with the RVLM projecting cells tending to be more medial . Most cells only contained a single fluorophore , but a small number of double-labeled neurons were also identified ( Figure 1C ) . The injection sites were also confirmed by local transduction into the 7n ( Figure 1D ) and RVLM ( Figure 1E ) . These results provide confidence that subgroups of preBötC neurons can be transduced based on their anatomical connection . To modulate the activity of selectively transduced neurons , we generated an adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) which enabled Cre-dependent ( DIO ) expression , under the control of the ubiquitous chicken β-actin/cytomegalovirus ( CAG ) promoter , of the light-activated chloride channel , GtACR2 , fused to a portion of Kv2 . 1 to promote predominant somatic targeting ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) , and an enhanced GFP ( MuGFP; Scott et al . , 2018 ) ; hereafter called AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP . This was co-injected with a Cre-expressing virus , AAVDJ8-Cre-TdTomato , in male Sprague-Dawley ( SD ) rats ( n=12 ) ( Figure 2A ) , to transduce the preBötC neurons in the region ventral and caudal to the tip of compact nucleus ambiguus . Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Cre recombination was effective and resulted in GtACR2-MuGFP expression in the preBötC ( Figure 2B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . The Kv2 . 1 motif improved the neuronal expression of GtACR2 , compared to GtACR2 alone ( Menuet et al . , 2020 ) , with a clear definition of neuronal boundaries ( Figure 2C ) . However , as previously demonstrated by other studies , the incorporation of the Kv2 . 1 motif into our viral construction did not prevent axonal expression of GtACR2-MuGFP ( Mahn et al . , 2018; Messier et al . , 2018 ) . At the caudal extent , a small proportion of GtACR2-MuGFP neurons also expressed parvalbumin , indicating likely transduction of some bulbospinal neurons of the rostral ventral respiratory group ( rVRG; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) and some parvalbumin vIRt neurons , that are located medially to nucleus ambiguus ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–F ) . Control injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP alone into preBötC did not produce any transduction ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C ) . Photoinhibition of these non-selectively transduced preBötC neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats produced very similar results to those described previously using a non-Cre-dependent approach ( Menuet et al . , 2020 ) . This included immediate interruption of breathing and long-lasting apnea . Apnea did not last for the entire photoinhibition period , with inspiration resuming 9 . 3 s ( 95% CI: 6 . 3–12 . 3 s ) , after the beginning of the stimulus , albeit with a slower frequency and shorter diaphragm electromyograpy ( dEMG ) amplitude during continued photoinhibition ( Figure 2D–F and M ) . We also observed a biphasic BP response , with a depressor response during the apnea and a pressor response upon resumption of breathing ( Figure 2D , G , and H ) . We also observed a reduction in HR that lasted the entire period of photoinhibition , although it was not statistically different ( Figure 2I and J ) . Orofacial muscle activity , measured from electrodes inserted into the MP near the rostral tip of the snout - the site of origin of the muscle nasolabialis profundus ( Haidarliu et al . , 2010 ) - showed activity during the pre-inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle , associated with the initial phase of vibrissae protraction ( Deschênes et al . , 2016 ) . With non-selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons , the MP activity increased in amplitude and shifted and became tonic ( Figure 2D , D1 and D2 and K ) with loss of inspiratory-related modulation . The onset of these effects correlated with apnea . When breathing resumed , during continued photoinhibition , the inspiratory-related MP activity also recovered , with increased amplitude , for the remainder of the stimulation period . Photoinhibition of the preBötC also immediately increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration ( Figure 2D and L ) . In some rats , rhythmic expiratory activity was observed with the return of dEMG inspiratory activity . Our results show that preBötC exerts a complex influence on orofacial activity as well as the timing of active expiration , potentially via the parafacial respiratory group . No changes in any of these parameters were observed in control rats injected with only AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP ( n=5 ) ( Figure 2E–M and Figure 2—figure supplement 2D ) . We injected AAVrg-mCherry-Cre into the lateral and dorsal lateral border of the facial nucleus ( n=6 ) . This region is known to contain respiratory-modulated facial motoneurons that receive projections from the preBötC ( Deschênes et al . , 2016; Takatoh et al . , 2013 ) , with the lateral most edge of the facial nucleus containing motoneurons that regulate pre-inspiratory phase activity of the facial nasolabialis profundus muscle to cause vibrissae protraction ( Deschênes et al . , 2016 ) . In the same surgery , we also injected AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP into the preBötC with the aim of selectively transducing preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus ( preBötC→7n; Figure 3A ) . This combinatorial approach resulted in GtACR2-MuGFP expression in a restricted , defined subgroup of preBötC neurons mostly located ventral to the extension of the subcompact nucleus ambiguus ( Figure 3B and C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . Some of the transduced neurons were also found intermingled with parvalbumin-expressing rVRG neurons , but no co-localization between MuGFP and parvalbumin was observed ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . A very small number of non-parvalbumin neurons ( vIRtPV ) , as well as sparse axonal labeling , was also observed medial to the nucleus ambiguus , in the region of the vIRt ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F ) . In urethane-anesthetized rats , photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons significantly reduced the amplitude of the MP activity for 7 . 3 s ( 95% CI: 0 . 5–14 . 2 s ) , with the complete abolition of the inspiratory-related activity of the MP in half of the rats ( MP activity baseline: 26 . 6 mV [95% CI: 9 . 4–43 . 8 mV] vs . during photoinhibition: 3 . 9 mV [95% CI: 1–6 . 8 mV] , p=0 . 02 ) ( Figure 3D , E , and L ) . In some rats , we observed a small decrease in dEMG amplitude ( baseline: 29 . 1 mV [95% CI: 11 . 2–47 mV] vs . during photoinhibition: 23 . 8 mV [95% CI: 9 . 9–37 . 5 mV] , p=0 . 04; Figure 3D , E , G , M , and N ) . A slight reduction in BP was also apparent at the beginning of the photoinhibition ( Figure 3H , I ) . Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n did not affect HR or Abd activity ( Figure 3J , K , and M ) . These results clearly identify a subgroup of preBötC neurons providing inspiratory modulation of facial motoneurons that innervate extrinsic protractor muscles of the MP , which appear to be largely independent of those that drive inspiratory activity to the diaphragm , abdominal muscles , and autonomic nervous system . To characterize the anatomical distribution and neurochemical phenotype of preBötC→7n neurons , we combined immunohistochemistry and RNAscope , to identify mRNA expression . Following non-selective transduction of preBötC , GtACR2-MuGFP expression occurred between 12 . 5 and 13 . 92 mm caudal to Bregma ( Figure 4A and B ) . We examined expression in detail in three rats and counted 1027 transduced neurons [95% CI: 769–1286 neurons] in each rat . Of these , 60 . 8% [95% CI: 59 . 2–62 . 4%] neurons expressed the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter ( VIAAT , also called VGAT ) , and 32 . 3% [95% CI: 30 . 5–34 . 1] the vesicular-glutamate transporter 2 ( VGlut2; Figure 4B–D ) . Further neurochemical characterization revealed that some MuGFP-expressing neurons also express somatostatin ( SST ) and/or reelin , and some NK1R ( Figure 4E–F ) . The preBötC→7n transduced neurons were more restricted and located more caudally , between 13 and 13 . 76 mm caudal to Bregma ( Figure 5A and B ) . In three rats , we counted 97 transduced neurons ( 95% CI: 32–162 neurons ) in each rat . We found that 48 . 5% ( 95% CI: 12 . 77–84 . 23% ) of muGFP neurons also expressed mCherry . We recognize that the percentage of co-localization seems to be lower than expected . However , considering that the Cre-loxP system requires only a single molecule of Cre-recombinase enzyme ( Van Duyne , 2015 ) , it is plausible that low levels of Cre , that were not detected by immunohistochemistry , had resulted in the expression of muGFP . As expected from previous reports ( Yang and Feldman , 2018 ) , a similar proportion of transduced preBötC→7n neurons expressed VGAT 38 . 6% ( 95% CI: 35 . 6–41 . 6% ) or VGlut2 38% ( 95% CI: –7% to 82 . 8% ) ( Figure 5B–D ) . We also found that some preBötC→7n transduced neurons also co-express SST , reelin , or NK1R ( Figure 5E–G ) . Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons produced a small effect on breathing and BP , although not statistically significant across the cohort . As suggested by our initial retrograde labeling experiments , where we observed a small number of preBötC with axon collaterals to both 7n and RVLM , we wondered whether collateralization might explain the small effects of photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons on non-facial motor outputs . Non-selective transduction of preBötC neurons resulted in a dense GtACR2-MuGFP-axonal expression in multiple brainstem nuclei ( Figure 6 ) , including the nucleus ambiguus ( Figure 6B ) , RVLM ( Figure 6C ) , Bötzinger complex ( BötC ) ( Figure 6C ) , hypoglossal nucleus ( Figure 6D ) , nucleus of the solitary tract ( NTS ) ( Figure 6F ) , 7n ( Figure 6E ) , rVRG ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) , and vIRt ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–E ) . Strong axonal labeling was observed in the 7n , particularly along the dorsal and lateral edge of the nucleus following transduction of preBötC→7n neurons ( Figure 7 ) . In these animals , we also observed sparse GtACR2-MuGFP-axonal expression in the nucleus ambiguus ( Figure 7B ) , BötC ( Figure 7C ) , RVLM ( Figure 7C ) , hypoglossal nucleus ( Figure 7D ) , NTS ( Figure 7F ) , rVRG ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) , and vIRt ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2F–I ) . These results indicate widespread collateralization of preBötC neurons into distinct areas of the brainstem . Whether this is the result of single neurons projecting to many targets or many neurons projecting to a small number of targets remains to be investigated . We speculate that this anatomical organization may contribute to the complex synchronization between respiratory , cardiovascular , orofacial , and potentially other physiological functions . The rhythmic orofacial activities , such as whisking and sniffing , require a hierarchical organization of brainstem circuitry that involves the whisking premotor neurons in the vIRt and the preBötC respiratory-related premotor neurons ( Deschênes et al . , 2016; Takatoh et al . , 2022 ) . The activity of the whisking premotor neurons in vIRt is strongly affected by anesthesia and animal state ( Deschênes et al . , 2016; Deschênes et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we evaluated whether the response to photoinhibition of preBötC neurons was also affected by the type of anesthesia and the animals’ state . Non-selective preBötC ( n=5 ) and selective preBötC→7n ( n=5 ) photoinhibition were performed under surgical ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia , during initial recovery to consciousness after reversal of anesthesia with atipamezole ( 1 mg/kg , i . p . ) , and 1–2 hr after reversal of anesthesia . \n Beyond affecting inspiratory and MP activity , non-selective inhibition of preBötC also increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration . The active expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles is strictly controlled by quiescent and synaptically inhibited late-expiratory neurons located in the lateral parafacial nucleus ( Magalhães et al . , 2021; Pagliardini et al . , 2011 ) . Our results support the evidence that preBötC is a potential source of inhibitory input to lateral parafacial . This interaction could be essential for the generation of active expiration in situations with increased respiratory demand , such as hypercapnia/acidosis ( Del Negro et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , in addition to regulating expiratory activity , it has been shown that the lateral parafacial nucleus may also play a role in coordinating nasofacial and orofacial behavior during high chemical drive via direct projections to 7n ( de Britto et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , indirect projections from preBötC to 7n via lateral parafacial nucleus may also be involved with the responses on the mystacial pad activity induced by the non-selective inhibition of preBötC . While there was a clear difference in the effect of selective preBötC→7n photoinhibition on breathing , compared to non-selective preBötC photoinhibition , selective photoinhibition did have small effects on breathing , particularly under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and its recovery phases . With the selective approach , we observed a much smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location . We did not see any transgene expression in the parvalbumin-expressing neurons of rVRG ( Alheid et al . , 2002; Wu et al . , 2017 ) . Both selective and non-selective approaches resulted in the MuGFP expression in a similar proportion of inhibitory and glutamatergic neurons . Interestingly , SST , reelin , and NK1R neurons were transduced . These are known as biomarkers for respiratory preBötC neurons . These results raised the question of whether preBötC→7n neurons are part of preBötC respiratory network or if they are a distinct neuronal group . While our data are not sufficient to adequately address this question , our working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons are transmitting respiratory rhythm , rather than being responsible for generating it . We conclude that the small effect of photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that the neurons projecting to the facial nucleus are a small subgroup of the rhythm-generating neurons with collaterals to the facial nucleus . In such a case , the effects on mystacial pad activity could be indirectly caused by the slowing of breathing . This hypothesis could be addressed by inhibiting the axons of preBötC→7n neurons within the facial nucleus . Although we have contemplated directing the optical fibers to the facial nucleus to evaluate this , we are cautious about using GtACR2 to inhibit axonal terminals , given the evidence of increased synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release in response to light-induced activation of GtACR2 at the axon terminal ( Messier et al . , 2018 ) . We observed that the transduced axons of preBötC→7n neurons projected widely into multiple brainstem nuclei , including RVLM , nA , NTS , BötC , rVRG , and vIRt . Collateral projections from excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons to premotor and motoneurons have been described before and appear to be essential for the coordination of inspiratory and expiratory activity ( Koizumi et al . , 2013 ) . It was suggested that divergent axonal projections from the commissural excitatory preBötC into the HN and rVRG may be essential for initiating the inspiratory activity . On the other hand , feedforward inhibition via collateral projections from inhibitory preBötC into these same regions may contribute to the dynamic shaping of the respiratory pattern ( Koizumi et al . , 2013 ) . While the functional role of many of these collateral projections has not been established yet , we hypothesize that the small effect of selective photoinhibition reflects their ongoing , functionally relevant activity . It is possible that the strict synchronization between premotor and motor neurons is not confined to respiratory motor activity , but is crucial for the coordination of respiratory , cardiovascular , and orofacial/nasofacial activity necessary for the execution of complex behaviors , such as exercise , response to stress , or pain . The preBötC , initially defined as the kernel for generating inspiratory rhythm , appears to act as a master oscillator regulating other physiological functions , such as orofacial behaviors and autonomic nervous activity . Our study suggests that groups of these neurons play principal roles in these specific functions . However , the widespread collateralization we observed along with effects of photoinhibition of the preBötC→7n on disparate motor activities raises the possibility that preBötC neurons may coordinate multiple outputs . Whether this is a function of most neurons projecting to more than one target , or a small number of neurons projecting to many targets , remains to be determined . As has been described previously using transgenic mice ( Yang and Feldman , 2018 ) , we also observed that different subpopulations of preBötC→7n express either markers of an excitatory phenotype or an inhibitory phenotype . The idea that one output nucleus provides both excitatory and inhibitory projection to a target is intriguing . Our methods could not determine whether these different neurochemical groups might project to the same target neuron , or whether the pathways are parallel and separate . It is possible that the different groups are active under different states and enable altered coupling to the respiratory cycle . For example , we speculate that under urethane anesthesia , when mystacial pad EMG is active , glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity and their photoinhibition resulted in a decrease in activity . In contrast , inhibitory preBötC→7n neurons would be more active in the conscious state , and their inhibition resulted in an increase in activity . Exaggerated inspiratory modulation of sympathetic activity is associated with the development of hypertension ( Menuet et al . , 2017; Simms et al . , 2009 ) , which can increase BP variability . Interestingly , independent of the BP level , BP variability seems to be an important contributor to organ damage , such as renal dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy , cardiovascular disease , and poor clinical outcomes ( Messerli et al . , 2019 ) . The central network underlying this autonomic dysfunction remains to be elucidated . Our previous studies suggest that respiratory input from preBötC to the catecholaminergic C1 neurons of RVLM may be involved with the increased inspiratory-sympathetic modulation in hypertensive rats ( Menuet et al . , 2017 ) . In this way , methodologies that only affect inputs from preBötC to C1 neurons , such as the approach used in the present study , could shine the light on the mechanisms involved in the development of hypertension and possibly contribute to the development of targeted therapeutics used to prevent hypertension development . We tested the hypothesis that the preBötC might consist of separate subpopulations of neurons that project to specific nuclei to coordinate respiratory rhythmicity with different physiological behaviors , such as nasofacial activity . We showed that even when selecting just neurons projecting to a specific target , both excitatory and inhibitory neurons were transduced . Selective photoinhibition of these neurons enabled observation of the effect on nasofacial motor activity in the absence of substantial changes in respiratory , or other autonomic , activities . However , small effects on these other functions , such as diaphragm muscle activity , remain . We observed collateral axonal projections of preBötC→7n neurons to several brainstem nuclei , including the rVRG , and conclude that these are functional , active projections . This unmasks the possibility that these neurons may play a role in the complex synchronization between respiratory , cardiovascular , orofacial , and potentially other , physiological functions . \n Experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia’s ‘Guidelines to promote the well-being of animals used for scientific purposes: The assessment and alleviation of pain and distress in research animals ( 2008 ) ’ and ‘Australian code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes’ and were approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Research Ethics and Biosafety Committees ( ethics ID#21396 ) . All experiments were performed on male SD rats , initially weighing 60–80 g . The rats were housed in standard cages in groups of up to 4 , had ad libitum access to standard chow and tap water , and were maintained under a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle in a 21°C temperature-regulated room at the University of Melbourne Biological Resources Facility . C-terminal fusion of a 65-amino acid trafficking motif from the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv2 . 1 ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) has been shown to enrich the expression of the GtACR2 in the somatic membrane of mouse cortical neurons ( Mahn et al . , 2018; Messier et al . , 2018 ) . We employed an analogous design in the present study to develop a GtACR2Kv2 . 1 fusion construct , with a monomeric , ultra-stable green fluorescent protein ( MuGFP ) tag ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) linked with four alanine residues to the GtACR2 C-terminus . To achieve Cre-dependent expression , GtACR2Kv2 . 1-MuGFP was incorporated into the pAAV-hSyn-DIO- ( hCAR ) off- ( ChETA-mRuby2 ) on-W3SL plasmid ( Addgene plasmid #111391; Li et al . , 2018 ) ; a gift from Prof . Adam Kepecs ( Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , NY , USA ) , using NheI and PacI restriction sites to replace the ChETA-mRuby2 coding sequence . The hSyn promoter was subsequently excised , and a CAG promoter sequence was ligated in its place via XbaI restriction sites . Following Cre-mediated recombination , the orientation of GtACR2Kv2 . 1-MuGFP coding sequence is reversed relative to the promoter , enabling the expression of GtACR2Kv2 . 1-MuGFP . Co-transfection of pAAV-CAG-DIO- ( hCAR ) off- ( GtACR2Kv2 . 1-MuGFP ) on-W3SL with pDPI and pDPII plasmids ( Grimm et al . , 2003 ) into AAV293 cells ( Agilent Technologies , CA , USA ) preceded harvesting and iodixanol gradient purification ( as described by Zolotukhin et al . , 1999 , and Ganella et al . , 2013 , of AAV1/2-CAG-DIO- ( hCAR ) off- ( GtACR2Kv2 . 1-MuGFP ) on-W3SL vector - also referred to here as AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP . Titration of purified AAV vector was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction as described by Ma et al . , 2017 ) , using forward ( 5’-CATTCTCGGACACAAACTGGAGTACAAC ) and reverse ( 5’- GTCTGCTAGTTGAACGGAACCATCTTC ) primers targeting the MuGFP coding sequence , rather than WPRE ( which is replaced here by W3SL ) . Primers were synthesized by Bioneer Pacific ( VIC , Australia ) . GtACR2-MuGFP , Kv2 . 1 , and CAG sequences were synthesized by GenScript ( NJ , USA ) . Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were sourced from New England Biolabs ( VIC , Australia ) and Promega ( NSW , Australia ) , respectively , and used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations . Non-selective expression of GtACR2Kv2 . 1-MuGFP in the preBötC was achieved by the injection of a mixture containing AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP ( 2 . 04×1011 GC/ml ) and AAVDJ8-CBA-Cre-TdTomato-WPRE ( 1 . 14×1012 GC/ml ) into preBötC . Selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP-Kv2 . 1 in preBötC neurons that project to the 7n was obtained by injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP into the preBötC and the retrograde pseudotyped AAVrg-EF1α-mCherry-IRES-Cre ( 8×1012 GC/ml; Addgene #55632-AVVrg ) into the 7n . Animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine ( 75 mg/kg , i . p . , Lyppard , Dingley , Australia ) and medetomidine ( 0 . 5 mg/kg , i . p . , Pfizer Animal Health , West Ryde , Australia ) . Eye moisture was maintained by the application of a hydrating gel ( POLY VISC Eye Ointment , Alcon ) . The surgical field was shaved and disinfected with 80% ethanol and chlorhexidine . Surgery was initiated once a deep surgical level of anesthesia was obtained , as evidenced by loss of the pedal withdrawal and corneal reflexes . Throughout the protocol , body temperature was maintained at 37 . 5°C with a heating pad ( TC-1000 Temperature controller , CWE Inc ) that was covered with an autoclaved non-absorbent pad . Rats were then placed in a stereotaxic frame with the nose ventro-flexed ( incisor bar –15 mm; RWD Life Science ) . Extracellular recordings of multiunit activity were used to functionally map the preBötC , as previously described ( Menuet et al . , 2020 ) . For all injections , the pipette was 20° angled in the caudal-rostral axis , the tip pointing forward . For injections into preBötC , the pipette was descended into the brainstem 1 . 5 mm lateral to the midline and the injections were made at the most rostral point at which vigorous inspiratory-locked activity was isolated ( typically 0 . 2±0 . 1 mm rostral , 1 . 6±0 . 4 mm ventral to the calamus scriptorius ) . The injections into preBötC were randomized and were made bilaterally , and a picospritzer ( World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL , USA ) was used to microinject the virus ( 50 nl over 5 min on each side ) . Antidromic field potentials , elicited by stimulating the mandibular branch of the facial nerve , were used to map the dorsal , caudal , ventral , and lateral edges of the facial nucleus , allowing precise targeting of the RVLM and the facial nucleus , as described before ( Menuet et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , an electrode was positioned so that this gently touched the mandibular branch of the facial nerve . An electrical current ( 2 . 0±0 . 5 mA ) was applied in order to stimulate the nerve . A picospritzer ( World Precision Instruments , Sarasota , FL , USA ) was used to microinject AAVrg ( 40 nl per injection site over 5 min ) into the RVLM immediately caudal to the facial nucleus . Injections were made bilaterally , 1 . 6 mm lateral to the midline at the caudal edge of the facial nucleus and 3 . 5±0 . 4 mm ventral to the calamus scriptorius . These injections were made in two rostrocaudal levels separated by 300 µm; the most rostral being at the caudal edge of the facial nucleus . A picospritzer was also used to microinject AAVrg ( 40 nl per injection site over 5 min ) into the facial nucleus . The injections were made bilaterally and targeted the lateral and dorsal-lateral borders of the facial nucleus ( 1 . 9 lateral to the midline , +1 . 4 and +1 . 1 rostral , and –2 . 9±0 . 2 mm ventral to the calamus scriptorius ) . At the end of the surgery , the neck muscles and the cheek skin were sutured with sterile absorbable polyglycolic acid 4/0 ( Surgicryl ) sutures using simple interrupted stitches . Subcutaneous injection of non-steroidal analgesic ( meloxicam 1 mg/kg , s . c . , Metacam , Lyppard ) and 1 ml of warmed Hartmann’s solution for fluid replacement was performed just before the intraperitoneal administration of atipamezole ( 1 mg/kg , i . m . , Antisedan , Pfizer Animal Health , West Ryde , Australia ) to reverse the effect of anesthesia . Postoperative analgesia with meloxicam and buprenorphine ( 0 . 025 mg/kg , s . c . , Schering-Plough , USA ) was maintained during the next 48 hr , and rats were monitored for any signs of surgical complications and weighed every day for 14 days . Following the 3–4 weeks of recovery from stereotaxic surgery , anesthesia was induced by inhalation of isoflurane ( Rhodia Australia Pty . Ltd . ) in an enclosed chamber . Once anesthetized , rats were transferred to the surgical bench , where anesthesia was maintained with 2–2 . 5% isoflurane , delivered in oxygen using a SomnoSuite low-flow anesthesia delivery system ( Kent Scientific ) . Body temperature was maintained at 37 . 5°C with a TC-1000 heat pad ( CWE Inc ) . A pulse oximeter probe was placed on a paw , and the body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe attached to the SomnoSuite anesthesia equipment . For dEMG recordings , a lateral abdominal incision was made , and two nylon-insulated stainless-steel wire electrodes ( 0 . 25 mm insulated diameter ) ending with suture pads ( 0 . 7 × 1 . 0 × 3 . 2 mm3 , Plastics One , VA , USA ) placed in the costal diaphragm , 3–4 mm apart . For abdominal EMG recordings , a lateral transverse incision was made in the abdomen region , and two silver wire electrodes ( 0 . 635 mm insulated diameter , A-M Systems ) were implanted in the oblique abdominal muscles , 4–5 mm apart . For mystacial pad EMG , an incision was made along the midline of the nose , and two silver wires ( 0 . 38 mm insulated diameter , A-M Systems ) were implanted into the mystacial pad near the rostral area of the snout - approximately between rows C and D and columns 5–7 , 3–4 mm apart . The femoral artery and vein of the left leg were cannulated for measurement of arterial pressure and drug administration , respectively ( PE10 tubing [ID 0 . 28× OD 0 . 61 mm] connected to PE50 [0 . 17×1 . 45 mm] ) . Isoflurane anesthesia was gradually replaced by 1 . 2 g/kg intravenous urethane , following which rats were tracheotomized , and oxygen ( 100% ) was directed over the tracheotomy cannula . The arterial catheter was connected to a Statham Gould ( P23 Db ) pressure transducer , and the dEMG , AbdEMG and mystacial pad EMG electrode wires were coupled to an amplifier ( 10 Hz to 5 kHz band-pass filter , 5 kHz sampling rate , Model 1700 Differential AC amplifier , A-M systems , Sequim , WA , USA ) . Arterial pressure and electromyography were recorded using Spike2 software ( Cambridge Electronic Design ) . Rats were transferred to a stereotaxic frame ( incisor bar +3 mm; RWD Life Science ) . To perform the optogenetic experiments , the optical fibers ( 200 μm diameter , 0 . 22 NA , Ø1 . 25 mm , RWD Life Science ) were secured to a manipulator on the stereotaxic frame and lowered through the dorsal surface of the skull through burr holes made bilaterally in the occipital bone centered approximately 1 mm rostral to the occipital suture , 1 . 8±0 . 2 mm lateral from the midline . Output intensity from the optical fibers was determined using a PM100D Meter ( Thorlabs , NJ , USA ) . The strongest physiological responses to GtACR2 stimulation ( 50 Hz , 5 ms pulse , 15–20 mW ) were found at 7 . 5±0 . 5 mm ventral to the surface of the skull . Following the 3–4 weeks of recovery from the virus injection , animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine ( 75 mg/kg ) and medetomidine ( 0 . 5 mg/kg ) . Eye moisture was maintained by the application of a hydrating gel ( POLY VISC Eye Ointment , Alcon ) . The surgical field was shaved and disinfected with 80% ethanol and chlorhexidine . Surgery was initiated once a deep surgical level of anesthesia was obtained , as evidenced by loss of the pedal withdrawal and corneal reflexes . Throughout the protocol , body temperature was maintained at 37 . 5°C with a heating pad ( TC-1000 Temperature Controller , CWE Inc ) covered with an autoclaved non-absorbent pad . Then , the rats underwent the implantation of a six‐channel pedestal with a back-mount ( Type 363 components , PlasticsOne , USA ) that contains percutaneous electrodes ( 2× cardiac electrocardiograms [ECG] , 2× dEMG and 2× mystacial pad EMG ) and remained externalized for tethering . The electrodes have socket-pin connections at the pedestal and stainless-steel suture pads ( ~0 . 5 mm2 ) for electrical recording ( PlasticsOne , USA ) . For implantation of the sterilized multi-lead electrode pedestal , a transverse incision was made on the dorsal surface , approximately 1 cm below the rat’s shoulder blades , and a subcutaneous tunnel opened between the two incisions . The two ECG and dEMG electrodes were placed according to previous studies ( Butler et al . , 2021; O’Callaghan et al . , 2020 ) . The mystacial pad EMG electrodes were fixed with a non-absorbable suture into the mystacial pad near the rostral area of the snout - approximately between rows C and D and columns 5–7 , 3–4 mm apart . The skin incision was closed with sterile absorbable polyglycolic acid 4/0 ( Surgicryl ) sutures and the multi-lead electrode pedestal was sutured with sterile non-absorbable surgical sutures ( 4–0 Supramid ) into place between the scapulae . All electrodes were tunneled to the pedestal and connected to it . At this point , the multi-lead electrode pedestal was connected to an amplifier ( 10 Hz to 5 KHz band-pass filter , 5 kHz sampling rate , Model 1700 Differential AC amplifier , A-M systems , Sequim , WA , USA ) . The signal was recorded and integrated using Spike2 version 9 . 0 software ( Cambridge Electronic Design ) . Following the implantation of the electrodes , rats were transferred to a stereotaxic frame ( incisor bar +3 mm; RWD Life Science ) . To perform the optogenetic experiments , the optical fibers ( 200 μm diameter , 0 . 22 NA , Ø1 . 25 mm , RWD Life Science ) were secured to a manipulator on the stereotaxic frame and lowered through the dorsal surface of the skull through burr bilateral holes made in the occipital bone centered approximately 1 mm rostral to the occipital suture , 1 . 8±0 . 2 mm lateral from the midline . Output intensity from the optical fibers was determined using a PM100D Meter ( Thorlabs , NJ , USA ) . Physiological responses to GtACR2 stimulation were investigated at 0 . 5 mm increments moving ventrally from the surface of the skull . The strongest physiological responses to GtACR2 stimulation ( 50 Hz , 5 ms pulse , 15–20 mW ) were typically observed at 7 . 5±0 . 5 mm ventral , and it was where the optical fibers were fixed with dental cement ( Pattern Resin LS , GC America INC , IL , USA ) . The rat was transferred to a recording cage , and the effects of preBötC photoinhibition on dEMG , ECG , and mystacial pad EMG were evaluated under three different states: when the animals were still under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia , during the very early stage of regaining consciousness , a few minutes after the anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole and 1–2 hr after the atipamezole injection when the animal had recovered from anesthesia , was completely awake and freely behaving . At the end of the urethane-anesthetized and conscious experiments , animals were perfused transcardially with 0 . 1 M phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) ( 1 ml/g of b . w . ) followed by 4% formaldehyde in 0 . 1 M PBS using a peristaltic pump ( Masterflex L/S Drive System , Cole-Parmer , Vernon Hills , IL , USA ) . The brains were removed , post-fixed in 4% PFA for 12 hr at 4°C , and then immersed in 20% sucrose at 4°C until processing . Brainstems were frozen at –20°C , and four series of coronal sections ( 40 µm thickness ) were cryostat sectioned . Sections were placed directly into cryoprotectant in a 24-well plate and stored at −20°C until processing . Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described ( Bassi et al . , 2022; Menuet et al . , 2020; Ngo et al . , 2020 ) . Primary antibodies used were chicken anti-GFP ( 1:5000 , Aves Labs Inc , Davis , CA , USA , Cat#: GFP-1010 ) , mouse anti-TH ( 1:5000 , Merck-Millipore , Bayswater , VIC , Australia , Cat#: MAB318 ) , rabbit anti-parvalbumin ( 1:5000 , Abcam , Melbourne , VIC , Australia , Cat#: ab11427 ) , rabbit anti-NK1R ( 1:5000 , Sigma-Aldrich , Melbourne , VIC , Australia , Cat # S8305 ) , goat anti-ChAT: ( 1:1000 , Chemicon-Merck , Bayswater , Australia , Cat#: AB144P ) , rabbit anti-dsRed: ( 1:5000 , Takara Bio , Clontech , Australia , Cat#: 632496 ) , goat anti-mCherry ( 1:5000 , Sicgen , Cantanhede , Portugal; Cat#: AB0040-200 ) . All secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc , West Grove , PA , USA , and were used at either 1:500 . The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken ( Cat#: 703545155 ) , Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit ( Cat#: 711165152 ) , Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat ( Cat#: 705165003 ) , Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse ( Cat#: 715175151 ) , and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat ( Cat#: 705175003 ) , and biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-goat ( Cat#: 705065147 ) . Streptavidin-Marina blue ( 1:200 , Cat#: S11221 ) was purchased from Invitrogen-Thermo Fisher Scientific , Scoresby , VIC , Australia . Brains from SD rats with the selective and non-selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP were used to perform this analysis . Briefly , brains were freshly extracted ( n=3 per group ) and frozen in isopentane and dry ice , then stored at –80°C . Brainstems were cryostat sectioned ( 16 µm ) , collected , and mounted onto Superfrost-Plus slides ( Thermo Scientific ) . Frozen sections were fixed in 4% PFA for 16 min at 4°C , rinsed twice in DEPC-treated 1× PBS for 1 min each , then dehydrated in 50% , 70% , and 100% ethanol solutions for 5 min each . Dehydrated sections were then stored in 100% ethanol overnight at –20°C . The following day , slides were air-dried at room temperature ( RT ) , and hydrophobic barriers were created using ImmEdge hydrophobic PAP pen ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA , USA ) . Sections were incubated with Protease IV ( ACD , CA , USA; Cat #322336 ) for 20 min at RT , rinsed twice with DEPC-treated 1× PBS for 1 min each before incubating with the probe mixture for 2 hr at 40°C . The probe mixture consisted of probes against VGAT ( SLC32A1-ACD;Cat #ADV424541-C2 ) , VGluT2 ( Slc17a6 , ACD; Cat #317011-C3 ) , SST ( Sst- ACD; Cat#ADV412181-C3 ) , reelin ( Reln-ACD; Cat ADV1048921- C1 ) , and C1 diluent ( ACD , Cat #ADV300041 ) . Signal amplification was achieved in accordance with the RNAscope multiplex fluorescence v1 kit manufacturer’s instructions ( ACD , Cat #320851 ) . Immediately following the RNAScope protocol , the immunofluorescence protocol for MuGFP was performed as previously described ( Bassi et al . , 2022 ) , nuclei stained with 4' , 6-Diamidine-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ) , and coverslipped using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant ( Invitrogen by Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Imaging was performed at the Biological and Optical Microscopy Platform , University of Melbourne as previously described ( Bassi et al . , 2022 ) . Lower power images were taken using epifluorescence microscopy ( Zeiss Axio Imager D1 microscope with a Zeiss AxioCam MR3 camera and EC Plan-NeoFuar 10×/0 . 3 air objective , Carl-Zeiss , North Ryde , NSW , Australia ) . High-resolution images were captured on Zeiss LSM880 confocal laser scanning microscope with Airyscan detectors ( 32 GaAsP PMT array ) at 20× using a Plan-Apochromat 20×/0 . 8 M27 objective ( Carl-Zeiss , North Ryde , NSW , Australia ) and ZEN 2 . 3 ( black edition ) imaging software . Z-stack images were taken with 0 . 4 µm z-intervals , and at least 50% overlap between optical slices obtaining 40–50 images over 15–30 µm thickness . Tile scan was performed with 10% overlap between neighboring tiles to image the entire distribution of labeled axonal fibers in the section . High-resolution images were also captured with high magnification using a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1 . 4 Oil DIC M27 objective . While GtACR2-MuGFP expression was examined across all animals , the maps of the distribution were generated from seven and five representative animals of non-selective and selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP , respectively . The animal was included in the data analysis only whether muGPF expression was confined within preBötC . To build the maps of distribution , the images containing GtACR2-MuGFP expression were selected and transformed in binary images according to a previously determined protocol ( Bassi et al . , 2022 ) . The traced bitmap image was overlayed on the corresponding coronal preBötC schematic diagram ( Palkovits , 1983 ) using the original fluorescence image as a guide . The total number of MuGFP immunofluorescent cells was determined either manually or using a macro every 160 µm . The quantification of co-localization among GtACR2-MuGFP , VGAT , and VGlut2 expression was made manually each ~200 µm . The neuron was considered as positive only if it contained at least eight dots of transcripts for the mRNA co-localized with a nucleus labeled with DAPI . The percentage of double ( MuGFP/VGlut2 or MuGFP/VGAT ) labeled neurons was calculated in relation to the total number of MuGFP cells that were quantified bilaterally . Analysis of the muscle activities was performed on rectified and smoothed signals ( time constant of 50 ms ) . dEMG activity was evaluated by its burst amplitude ( DIA , V ) and frequency ( fR , breaths/min ) . The DIA amplitude , fR , BP , and HR values were extracted from Spike2 at the sample rate of 1 Hz and were graphically represented as absolute values . These values were taken in three different periods: during baseline ( 15 s before the beginning of photoinhibition ) , during the 15–30 s of photoinhibition and during the recovery period ( 15 s post-photoinhibition ) . SpikeSorting analysis ( Spike2 software , Cambridge Electronic Design ) was also employed to evaluate to compare the temporal activity of MP during baseline and during photoinhibition . The quantification of the synchronization between MP activity and diaphragm activity during the selective photoinhibition of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons was also performed by analyzing the event-triggered average of MP activity ( triggered by the rapid rise of dEMG that occurs at the beginning of inspiration ) over 5–8 respiratory cycles during baseline and during the initial period of photoinhibition . The magnitude of inspiratory-related modulation of MP activity in the 150–200 ms before and after the onset of inspiration was plotted in graphs . The function ‘modulus’ of Spike2 was used to extract the areas under the curve of the raw signal of dEMG , AbdEMG , and mystacial pad EMG activities . The area under the curve values and the changes in SAP , HR , and fR were extracted from three different periods: during baseline ( 5 respiratory cycles before the beginning of the photoinhibition ) , during the photoinhibition , and during the recovery ( 5 respiratory cycles after the end of the photoinhibition ) . The photoinhibition period was further divided into two periods: P1 ( extracted during the 5 first respiratory cycles from the beginning of photoinhibition or , in the case where apnea was present , was collected the same extension as the 5 respiratory cycles during baseline ) and P2 ( 5 respiratory cycles after the breathing resumption ) . All sets of data were submitted to the normality test ( SigmaPlot v11 , CA , USA ) . In cases where the set of data failed to pass the normality test , the data was assessed by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test with multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni-Dunn method ( GraphPad Prism9 , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . If the data passed the normality test , two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc . Statistical analysis of the period P1 was performed using either the unpaired t-test , if the set of the data passed the normality test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test . All data are described as the mean ( 95% confidence interval ) and were graphically represented as mean ± 95% CI using GraphPad ( GraphPad Prism9 , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Differences were considered significant at p<0 . 05 .",

         "The pre-Bötzinger complex  , a key primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm , contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus  motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity . To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons , we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity , with minimal effects on breathing . The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity . We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons , based on their axonal projections , is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors . Strict coordination of breathing with the activity of facial and upper airway muscles underlies the rhythmic orofacial behaviors , such as sniffing , sucking , licking , whisking , vocalization , and swallowing , which are fundamental for ingestive and exploratory behavior , and social interaction  . The network of neurons coordinating breathing is distributed throughout the brainstem , with a major group responsible for generating inspiration located in the pre-Bötzinger complex  within the ventrolateral medulla oblongata  . In rodents , the preBötC consists of a heterogeneous population of ~3000 neurons with distinct , but intermingled , excitatory and inhibitory subgroups  . Anatomical studies showed that preBötC sends parallel excitatory and inhibitory projections to target nuclei throughout the brain , including to regions responsible for respiratory motor activity  . As indicated by their extensive projections , preBötC neurons modulate many circuits in addition to those required for breathing activity . For example , preBötC neurons project monosynaptically to key medullary centers for autonomic regulation , and modulate cardiorespiratory coupling  . Photoinhibition of preBötC neurons produces the expected apnea , but also causes a significant reduction of sympathetic vasomotor activity , reduces respiratory modulation of BP , and increases cardiac parasympathetic nerve activity to decrease HR and respiratory-sinus arrhythmia  . Neurons in the preBötC also modulate orofacial behaviors . Activation of the developing brain homeobox1  -expressing preBötC neurons alters the networks responsible for the coordination of upper airways and swallowing , to decrease the probability of swallowing during inspiration  . The preBötC also contributes to motor patterns that are necessary for exploratory behaviors , such as sniffing and whisking . In this case , a group of inhibitory preBötC neurons provide monosynaptic inputs onto the vibrissal premotor neurons in the intermediate reticular nucleus  to facilitate synchronous whisking . In addition , preBötC contains facial premotor neurons that modulate nasal dilation and mystacial pad  muscle activity to couple whisking to the breathing rhythm  . Understanding and identifying the preBötC subgroups that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors is of fundamental importance , given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors has been associated with the development and progression of diseases  . Although several studies have attempted to understand the physiological function/s of each preBötC neuronal subpopulation , disturbances in breathing , that occur when preBötC neurons are either inhibited or activated , impact our understanding of whether the observed changes are due to the direct effects of preBötC neurons or alterations resulting from changes in the respiratory rhythm and blood gases  . Furthermore , whilst substantial gains have been made in understanding the expression of selective molecular markers in subgroups of preBötC neurons , it is rarely possible to reliably assign particular neurochemical signatures to unique functions  . To further understand the organization of the preBötC , in this study , we have tested the hypothesis that the preBötC region is composed of segregated subgroups of output neurons , potentially driven by a separate group of rhythmogenic neurons , that modulate specific behaviors , such as orofacial muscle activity . If correct , we predict that selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus  should modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity . To test this hypothesis , we utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach with one virus providing cre-recombinase  -dependent expression of an optically activated chloride channel , GtACR2 , and another retrograde axonal delivery of Cre . We showed that selective transduction and photoinhibition of preBötC facial premotor neurons affects the MP activity while minimally affecting breathing . To evaluate whether distinct subgroups of preBötC neurons could be distinguished based on their axonal projections , retrograde adeno-associated viruses  , expressing either green fluorescent protein  , or the red fluorophore , mCherry , were injected into 7n and the rostral ventrolateral medulla   , respectively  . Three weeks later , fluorophore expression was observed in preBötC neurons , with overlapping distribution  , albeit with the RVLM projecting cells tending to be more medial . These results provide confidence that subgroups of preBötC neurons can be transduced based on their anatomical connection . To modulate the activity of selectively transduced neurons , we generated an adeno-associated virus  which enabled Cre-dependent  expression , under the control of the ubiquitous chicken β-actin/cytomegalovirus  promoter , of the light-activated chloride channel , GtACR2 , fused to a portion of Kv2 . 1 to promote predominant somatic targeting  , and an enhanced GFP  ; hereafter called AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP . This was co-injected with a Cre-expressing virus , AAVDJ8-Cre-TdTomato , in male Sprague-Dawley  rats   , to transduce the preBötC neurons in the region ventral and caudal to the tip of compact nucleus ambiguus . Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Cre recombination was effective and resulted in GtACR2-MuGFP expression in the preBötC  . 1 motif improved the neuronal expression of GtACR2 , compared to GtACR2 alone  , with a clear definition of neuronal boundaries  . 1 motif into our viral construction did not prevent axonal expression of GtACR2-MuGFP  . At the caudal extent , a small proportion of GtACR2-MuGFP neurons also expressed parvalbumin , indicating likely transduction of some bulbospinal neurons of the rostral ventral respiratory group  and some parvalbumin vIRt neurons , that are located medially to nucleus ambiguus  . Control injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP alone into preBötC did not produce any transduction  . Photoinhibition of these non-selectively transduced preBötC neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats produced very similar results to those described previously using a non-Cre-dependent approach  . Orofacial muscle activity , measured from electrodes inserted into the MP near the rostral tip of the snout - the site of origin of the muscle nasolabialis profundus  - showed activity during the pre-inspiratory phase of the respiratory cycle , associated with the initial phase of vibrissae protraction  . With non-selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons , the MP activity increased in amplitude and shifted and became tonic  with loss of inspiratory-related modulation . When breathing resumed , during continued photoinhibition , the inspiratory-related MP activity also recovered , with increased amplitude , for the remainder of the stimulation period . Photoinhibition of the preBötC also immediately increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration  . Our results show that preBötC exerts a complex influence on orofacial activity as well as the timing of active expiration , potentially via the parafacial respiratory group . No changes in any of these parameters were observed in control rats injected with only AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP   . This region is known to contain respiratory-modulated facial motoneurons that receive projections from the preBötC  , with the lateral most edge of the facial nucleus containing motoneurons that regulate pre-inspiratory phase activity of the facial nasolabialis profundus muscle to cause vibrissae protraction  . In the same surgery , we also injected AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP into the preBötC with the aim of selectively transducing preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus  . This combinatorial approach resulted in GtACR2-MuGFP expression in a restricted , defined subgroup of preBötC neurons mostly located ventral to the extension of the subcompact nucleus ambiguus  . Some of the transduced neurons were also found intermingled with parvalbumin-expressing rVRG neurons , but no co-localization between MuGFP and parvalbumin was observed  . A very small number of non-parvalbumin neurons  , as well as sparse axonal labeling , was also observed medial to the nucleus ambiguus , in the region of the vIRt  . In urethane-anesthetized rats , photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons significantly reduced the amplitude of the MP activity for 7 . Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n did not affect HR or Abd activity  . These results clearly identify a subgroup of preBötC neurons providing inspiratory modulation of facial motoneurons that innervate extrinsic protractor muscles of the MP , which appear to be largely independent of those that drive inspiratory activity to the diaphragm , abdominal muscles , and autonomic nervous system . To characterize the anatomical distribution and neurochemical phenotype of preBötC→7n neurons , we combined immunohistochemistry and RNAscope , to identify mRNA expression . Following non-selective transduction of preBötC , GtACR2-MuGFP expression occurred between 12 . Further neurochemical characterization revealed that some MuGFP-expressing neurons also express somatostatin  and/or reelin , and some NK1R  . The preBötC→7n transduced neurons were more restricted and located more caudally , between 13 and 13 . 5%  of muGFP neurons also expressed mCherry . As expected from previous reports  , a similar proportion of transduced preBötC→7n neurons expressed VGAT 38 . We also found that some preBötC→7n transduced neurons also co-express SST , reelin , or NK1R  . Photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons produced a small effect on breathing and BP , although not statistically significant across the cohort . As suggested by our initial retrograde labeling experiments , where we observed a small number of preBötC with axon collaterals to both 7n and RVLM , we wondered whether collateralization might explain the small effects of photoinhibition of preBötC→7n neurons on non-facial motor outputs . Non-selective transduction of preBötC neurons resulted in a dense GtACR2-MuGFP-axonal expression in multiple brainstem nuclei  , including the nucleus ambiguus  , RVLM  , Bötzinger complex   , hypoglossal nucleus  , nucleus of the solitary tract   , 7n  , rVRG  , and vIRt  . Strong axonal labeling was observed in the 7n , particularly along the dorsal and lateral edge of the nucleus following transduction of preBötC→7n neurons  . In these animals , we also observed sparse GtACR2-MuGFP-axonal expression in the nucleus ambiguus  , BötC  , RVLM  , hypoglossal nucleus  , NTS  , rVRG  , and vIRt  . These results indicate widespread collateralization of preBötC neurons into distinct areas of the brainstem . Whether this is the result of single neurons projecting to many targets or many neurons projecting to a small number of targets remains to be investigated . The rhythmic orofacial activities , such as whisking and sniffing , require a hierarchical organization of brainstem circuitry that involves the whisking premotor neurons in the vIRt and the preBötC respiratory-related premotor neurons  . The activity of the whisking premotor neurons in vIRt is strongly affected by anesthesia and animal state  . Here , we evaluated whether the response to photoinhibition of preBötC neurons was also affected by the type of anesthesia and the animals’ state . Non-selective preBötC  and selective preBötC→7n  photoinhibition were performed under surgical ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia , during initial recovery to consciousness after reversal of anesthesia with atipamezole  , and 1–2 hr after reversal of anesthesia . Beyond affecting inspiratory and MP activity , non-selective inhibition of preBötC also increased and produced tonic activity of the abdominal muscle that lasted for the apnea duration . The active expiratory activity of the abdominal muscles is strictly controlled by quiescent and synaptically inhibited late-expiratory neurons located in the lateral parafacial nucleus  . Our results support the evidence that preBötC is a potential source of inhibitory input to lateral parafacial . Interestingly , in addition to regulating expiratory activity , it has been shown that the lateral parafacial nucleus may also play a role in coordinating nasofacial and orofacial behavior during high chemical drive via direct projections to 7n  . Thus , indirect projections from preBötC to 7n via lateral parafacial nucleus may also be involved with the responses on the mystacial pad activity induced by the non-selective inhibition of preBötC . While there was a clear difference in the effect of selective preBötC→7n photoinhibition on breathing , compared to non-selective preBötC photoinhibition , selective photoinhibition did have small effects on breathing , particularly under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and its recovery phases . Both selective and non-selective approaches resulted in the MuGFP expression in a similar proportion of inhibitory and glutamatergic neurons . These are known as biomarkers for respiratory preBötC neurons . These results raised the question of whether preBötC→7n neurons are part of preBötC respiratory network or if they are a distinct neuronal group . While our data are not sufficient to adequately address this question , our working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons are transmitting respiratory rhythm , rather than being responsible for generating it . We conclude that the small effect of photoinhibiting these neurons on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that the neurons projecting to the facial nucleus are a small subgroup of the rhythm-generating neurons with collaterals to the facial nucleus . This hypothesis could be addressed by inhibiting the axons of preBötC→7n neurons within the facial nucleus . Although we have contemplated directing the optical fibers to the facial nucleus to evaluate this , we are cautious about using GtACR2 to inhibit axonal terminals , given the evidence of increased synaptic activity and neurotransmitter release in response to light-induced activation of GtACR2 at the axon terminal  . We observed that the transduced axons of preBötC→7n neurons projected widely into multiple brainstem nuclei , including RVLM , nA , NTS , BötC , rVRG , and vIRt . Collateral projections from excitatory and inhibitory preBötC neurons to premotor and motoneurons have been described before and appear to be essential for the coordination of inspiratory and expiratory activity  . It was suggested that divergent axonal projections from the commissural excitatory preBötC into the HN and rVRG may be essential for initiating the inspiratory activity . On the other hand , feedforward inhibition via collateral projections from inhibitory preBötC into these same regions may contribute to the dynamic shaping of the respiratory pattern  . While the functional role of many of these collateral projections has not been established yet , we hypothesize that the small effect of selective photoinhibition reflects their ongoing , functionally relevant activity . It is possible that the strict synchronization between premotor and motor neurons is not confined to respiratory motor activity , but is crucial for the coordination of respiratory , cardiovascular , and orofacial/nasofacial activity necessary for the execution of complex behaviors , such as exercise , response to stress , or pain . The preBötC , initially defined as the kernel for generating inspiratory rhythm , appears to act as a master oscillator regulating other physiological functions , such as orofacial behaviors and autonomic nervous activity . However , the widespread collateralization we observed along with effects of photoinhibition of the preBötC→7n on disparate motor activities raises the possibility that preBötC neurons may coordinate multiple outputs . Whether this is a function of most neurons projecting to more than one target , or a small number of neurons projecting to many targets , remains to be determined . As has been described previously using transgenic mice  , we also observed that different subpopulations of preBötC→7n express either markers of an excitatory phenotype or an inhibitory phenotype . For example , we speculate that under urethane anesthesia , when mystacial pad EMG is active , glutamatergic preBötC→7n neurons play a major role in regulating the respiration-related mystacial pad activity and their photoinhibition resulted in a decrease in activity . In contrast , inhibitory preBötC→7n neurons would be more active in the conscious state , and their inhibition resulted in an increase in activity . Our previous studies suggest that respiratory input from preBötC to the catecholaminergic C1 neurons of RVLM may be involved with the increased inspiratory-sympathetic modulation in hypertensive rats  . In this way , methodologies that only affect inputs from preBötC to C1 neurons , such as the approach used in the present study , could shine the light on the mechanisms involved in the development of hypertension and possibly contribute to the development of targeted therapeutics used to prevent hypertension development . We tested the hypothesis that the preBötC might consist of separate subpopulations of neurons that project to specific nuclei to coordinate respiratory rhythmicity with different physiological behaviors , such as nasofacial activity . We showed that even when selecting just neurons projecting to a specific target , both excitatory and inhibitory neurons were transduced . Selective photoinhibition of these neurons enabled observation of the effect on nasofacial motor activity in the absence of substantial changes in respiratory , or other autonomic , activities . We observed collateral axonal projections of preBötC→7n neurons to several brainstem nuclei , including the rVRG , and conclude that these are functional , active projections . This unmasks the possibility that these neurons may play a role in the complex synchronization between respiratory , cardiovascular , orofacial , and potentially other , physiological functions . 1  has been shown to enrich the expression of the GtACR2 in the somatic membrane of mouse cortical neurons  . 1-MuGFP coding sequence is reversed relative to the promoter , enabling the expression of GtACR2Kv2 . , 2013 , of AAV1/2-CAG-DIO-  off-  on-W3SL vector - also referred to here as AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP . 1-MuGFP in the preBötC was achieved by the injection of a mixture containing AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP  and AAVDJ8-CBA-Cre-TdTomato-WPRE  into preBötC . Selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP-Kv2 . 1 in preBötC neurons that project to the 7n was obtained by injections of AAV-DIO-GtACR2-MuGFP into the preBötC and the retrograde pseudotyped AAVrg-EF1α-mCherry-IRES-Cre  into the 7n . Extracellular recordings of multiunit activity were used to functionally map the preBötC , as previously described  . For injections into preBötC , the pipette was descended into the brainstem 1 . The injections into preBötC were randomized and were made bilaterally , and a picospritzer  was used to microinject the virus  . Antidromic field potentials , elicited by stimulating the mandibular branch of the facial nerve , were used to map the dorsal , caudal , ventral , and lateral edges of the facial nucleus , allowing precise targeting of the RVLM and the facial nucleus , as described before  . For mystacial pad EMG , an incision was made along the midline of the nose , and two silver wires  were implanted into the mystacial pad near the rostral area of the snout - approximately between rows C and D and columns 5–7 , 3–4 mm apart . The mystacial pad EMG electrodes were fixed with a non-absorbable suture into the mystacial pad near the rostral area of the snout - approximately between rows C and D and columns 5–7 , 3–4 mm apart . The rat was transferred to a recording cage , and the effects of preBötC photoinhibition on dEMG , ECG , and mystacial pad EMG were evaluated under three different states: when the animals were still under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia , during the very early stage of regaining consciousness , a few minutes after the anesthesia was reversed with atipamezole and 1–2 hr after the atipamezole injection when the animal had recovered from anesthesia , was completely awake and freely behaving . The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa488-conjugated donkey anti-chicken  , Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit  , Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat  , Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-mouse  , and Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-goat  , and biotin-SP-conjugated donkey anti-goat  . Brains from SD rats with the selective and non-selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP were used to perform this analysis . While GtACR2-MuGFP expression was examined across all animals , the maps of the distribution were generated from seven and five representative animals of non-selective and selective expression of GtACR2-MuGFP , respectively . The animal was included in the data analysis only whether muGPF expression was confined within preBötC . To build the maps of distribution , the images containing GtACR2-MuGFP expression were selected and transformed in binary images according to a previously determined protocol  . The traced bitmap image was overlayed on the corresponding coronal preBötC schematic diagram  using the original fluorescence image as a guide . The quantification of co-localization among GtACR2-MuGFP , VGAT , and VGlut2 expression was made manually each ~200 µm . The percentage of double  labeled neurons was calculated in relation to the total number of MuGFP cells that were quantified bilaterally . The quantification of the synchronization between MP activity and diaphragm activity during the selective photoinhibition of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons was also performed by analyzing the event-triggered average of MP activity  over 5–8 respiratory cycles during baseline and during the initial period of photoinhibition .

         "Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain . If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm , their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat . However , most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses , with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors . To address this , we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice . Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes . Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests , presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous . In contrast , animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses , even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning . These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system , capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception , and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger . \n Effective survival necessitates a repertoire of dynamic defensive behaviors , encompassing both passive and active responses . Passive defensive strategies , such as freezing , help avoid detection from predators by reducing motion ( Blanchard and Blanchard , 1969a; Fanselow , 1980; Fanselow , 1982 ) . In contrast , active defensive behaviors , including fleeing or fighting , enable animals to swiftly escape or confront imminent threats ( Blanchard and Blanchard , 1969b; Bolles , 1970 ) . The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active defenses in response to varying threat contexts is essential for optimizing survival outcomes , as demonstrated by studies utilizing naturalistic threat stimuli like predator-like robots or looming disks , which allowed the observation of various critical defensive behaviors ( Choi and Kim , 2010; Kang et al . , 2022; Pyeon et al . , 2023; Telensky et al . , 2011 ) . A critical component of this adaptive response is the general alarm signal , which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting appropriate defensive behaviors in the face of threats . These signals help organisms quickly recognize and respond to potential threats . The mechanisms underlying these alarm signals can be studied through Pavlovian fear conditioning ( Bolles and Collier , 1976; Fanselow and Poulos , 2005; LeDoux , 2000; Maren , 2001 ) . In this process , a neutral sensory stimulus ( conditioned stimulus or CS ) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus ( US ) , leading to a conditioned response ( CR ) that can be expressed as either freezing or fleeing , depending on the specific features of the CS ( Borkar and Fadok , 2021; Fadok et al . , 2017 ) and US ( Lee et al . , 2018; Pyeon et al . , 2023 ) . Neurons within the PBN that express CGRP have been suggested to function as general alarm signals in the brain ( Palmiter , 2018 ) . These neurons respond to noxious stimuli of diverse sensory modalities ( Campos et al . , 2018; Carter et al . , 2013; Chen et al . , 2018; Kang et al . , 2022 ) and transmit interoceptive and exteroceptive information to the forebrain ( Bernard and Besson , 1988; Chiang et al . , 2019 ) . Additionally , these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock ( Han et al . , 2015 ) . Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior , demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories ( Bowen et al . , 2020; Han et al . , 2015 ) . However , for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system , they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors , whether passive or active . While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established , their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored . To address this , we employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals , thereby incorporating an imminent threat . We hypothesized that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat . We first recorded CGRP neuron activity in response to various aversive stimuli including the robot chasing to determine whether they encode noxious stimuli differentially . We then manipulated CGRP activity—both activating and inactivating—during fear conditioning with robot chasing and footshock . Our results suggest that manipulation of CGRP neurons bidirectionally modulates conditioned fleeing behaviors through altering the perception of the threat . These results highlight the role of CGRP neurons as a general alarm signal , primarily facilitating passive defensive behaviors , while also engaging in active defensive behaviors in response to high-threat conditions . \n The response profiles of CGRP neurons in conventional fear conditioning with footshock have been well-reported ( Han et al . , 2015 ) . However , how CGRP neurons respond to chasing threats has not been established . To investigate the activity of CGRP neurons in response to robot chasing , in vivo recordings using the optical-tagging strategy were performed ( Jo et al . , 2018; Juarez et al . , 2023 ) . Heterozygous mice expressing Cre-recombinase at the Calca locus ( CalcaCre/+ ) were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) carrying an excitatory channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) with red fluorescent protein ( AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet ) . Then , a movable optrode array containing one optic fiber with four tetrodes was implanted over the PBN ( Figure 1A ) . After 2 wk of recovery , neuronal activity was recorded during fear conditioning with a robot over three consecutive days ( Figure 1B ) . Animals were first habituated to a tone ( 4 kHz; 70 dB; 10 s ) as a CS in a rectangular box . The following day , the animals were placed in a donut-shaped maze and presented with the CS 10 times , each paired with an US of being chased by the robot at a speed of 70 cm/s for 3 s . When animals collided with the robot , it pushed them forward , increasing their fleeing speed ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . If an animal blocked its path , the robot continued to push it , but its speed decreased due to friction and reduced motor power , ensuring it did not run over the animal . On day 3 , fear memory was assessed by presenting the CS alone 10 times in the same context as the habituation session . In this behavioral paradigm , animals engaged in both passive and active defensive strategies , as evidenced by freezing and flight responses during conditioning ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Passive behavior was measured by freezing , defined as the absence of movement , while active behavior was represented by flight , quantified with a flight score calculated by dividing the average velocity during the CS by the average velocity during the pre-CS period ( Borkar et al . , 2024; Fadok et al . , 2017 ) . While both responses were observed during conditioning , the test day , conducted without the robot , showed increased freezing and reduced fleeing responses ( Figure 1C and D ) . To identify CGRP neurons , 10 pulses of blue light ( 5 ms duration ) at 30 Hz were delivered 10 times at the end of each behavioral recording session . Out of 183 PBN neurons , 84 cells with a high probability of light-evoked spikes ( >0 . 8 ) and a short spike latency ( <5 . 5 ms ) after light onset were classified as CGRP neurons ( Figure 1E ) . Compared to habituation , CGRP neurons showed significantly increased excitation to the CS during conditioning and retention , but only within the first 1 s after CS onset ( 1 . 5-fold increase ) ; this difference became non-significant starting at 2 s ( Figure 1G ) . However , these neurons exhibited significant excitation to the US with a fourfold increase ( Figure 1F and G ) . Our findings using the robot as the US revealed that CGRP neurons primarily represent US information , albeit to a lesser extent , the onset of US-predictive information . Given that CGRP neurons preferentially respond to the aversive US , we next asked how CGRP neurons encode different types of aversive stimuli . To address this , we monitored the activity of CGRP neurons while the animals received three types of stimuli , each varying in perceived threat intensity: ( 1 ) a pinprick to the hind paw using a needle ( approximately 0 . 5 s ) ; ( 2 ) a tail pinch 2 cm from the tail base using forceps ( 1 s ) ; and ( 3 ) being chased by a robot ( 3 s ) . These aversive stimuli elicited different defensive behaviors . The pinprick caused hind paw withdrawal , and the tail pinch triggered vocalizations ( audible squeaks ) and immediate escaping behavior , indicating the highest threat intensity , whereas the robot chasing prompted only escaping behavior without any vocalization . CGRP neurons showed significantly excited firing that was time-locked to the onset of all three aversive stimuli and maintained this activity throughout the duration of each stimulus . After the offset of the stimuli , neuronal activity gradually restored back to the baseline with a slight delay ( Figure 1H ) . These aversive stimuli elicited significantly different amplitudes of firing rates ( Figure 1I ) . During the tail pinch , which generated the strongest defensive behavior , CGRP neurons exhibited the highest excitation amplitude , ranging from 33 to 98 Hz , with an average of 58 Hz . Taken together , these results indicate that CGRP neurons represent the temporal characteristics and intensity of different aversive stimuli through variations in firing duration and amplitude . To determine whether increasing or decreasing CGRP neuronal activity would induce defensive behaviors other than freezing , we first observed which defensive behaviors were elicited by either stimulating or inhibiting CGRP neurons in the absence of any external stimuli . CalcaCre/+ mice were randomly assigned to groups and bilaterally injected with either AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet for activation , AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP for inactivation , or AAV-DIO-eYFP for control , followed by the implantation of optic fibers over the PBN ( Figure 2A ) . To activate CGRP neurons , mice received 30 s of 40 Hz photostimulation , delivered four times , based on the observed spontaneous firing rate of approximately 43 Hz in response to robot chasing ( Figure 1I ) . For inactivation , CGRP neurons were inhibited for 2 s , followed by a 1 s ramp down , repeated in cycles until a total duration of 30 s . Jaws and control groups showed no difference in movement during light on and off phases , indicating that light delivery did not alter their defensive behavior ( Figure 2B ) . However , activation of CGRP neurons immediately induced robust freezing behavior , consistent with previous studies ( Bowen et al . , 2020; Han et al . , 2015 ) . These results confirmed that stimulating CGRP neurons without external aversive stimuli generates rapid , unconditioned freezing behavior in mice . We then tested whether manipulating the activity of CGRP neurons during fear conditioning with robot chasing promotes fleeing behavior or amplifies freezing behavior . To effectively enhance the general alarm signal , additional activation of CGRP neurons was applied at 30 Hz during the robot chasing . CalcaCre/+ mice underwent the fear conditioning paradigm in which the CS was paired with the robot chasing ( 3 s , 70 cm/s ) , with CGRP neurons selectively activated ( 30 Hz ) or inhibited ( 3 s on and 1 s ramp down ) throughout the presentation of the chasing ( Figure 3A ) . To rule out the possibility that the observed behavior was merely a reaction to the cue and confirm that it resulted from the CS-US pairing , an unpaired group was included . In this group , the CS was not paired with the robot chasing; instead , the robot chasing was delivered within the inter-trial interval . Physical bumping occurred during robot chasing , potentially influencing the perception of threat . To ensure that differences in defensive behavior were not due to variations in bumping among the four groups , we analyzed bumping incidents and found no significant differences ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; Video 1 ) . This confirms that any observed differences in defensive responses are likely attributable to alterations in CGRP neuronal activity . During conditioning , all four groups demonstrated fear memory formation , as evidenced by a progressive increase in freezing levels ( Figure 3B ) . However , the Jaws and unpaired groups showed significantly lower freezing levels than the control and ChR2 groups . For the flight score on the conditioning day , the ChR2 group displayed significantly higher levels compared to the other three groups ( Figure 3C ) , while the Jaws and unpaired groups consistently had lower flight scores than the control group . Additionally , analysis of movement velocity revealed that ChR2 mice had a higher fleeing speed in response to the CS compared to the other four groups ( Figure 3D ) . Fear memory was assessed 24 hr after conditioning by presenting four CSs alone . During the retention test , the control group exhibited robust freezing as its dominant defensive behavior . In contrast , the ChR2 group displayed significantly higher fight scores compared to the other three groups ( Figure 3E and F; Video 2 ) . The Jaws group exhibited lower flight responses due to inhibited US signaling during conditioning . However , contrary to our expectations , the Jaws group displayed freezing levels that were not significantly different from those of the control group ( Figure 3E ) . This result may be attributed to post-illumination rebound excitation , as Jaws has been shown to yield residual activity even when ramped illumination is used to minimize this effect ( Chuong et al . , 2014 ) . The unpaired group exhibited significantly lower freezing levels compared to the paired control group . However , flight scores in the unpaired group were significantly higher than those in the control group . This was likely due to the tendency of the control group to remain frozen before and during the CS presentation . The unpaired group , however , showed sensory orientation responses to the CS , contributing to their elevated fleeing scores . Moreover , the movement speed of the unpaired group during the tone CS did not exceed 3 cm/s , suggesting exploratory rather than defensive behavior in the test environment ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D ) . Taken together , these findings suggest that enhanced CGRP activity during imminent threat promotes fleeing behavior during conditioning , sustaining the heightened flight response through the retention test . We next examined whether the same modulation of CGRP neuron activity paired with electric footshock ( 1 s; 0 . 3 mA ) would also engage in active defensive behavior . After a 1 wk rest period following the conditioning paradigm with the robot , the control , ChR2 , and Jaws groups of mice underwent conventional fear conditioning ( Figure 4A ) . Although the CS used in the conventional fear conditioning ( 12 kHz; 70 dB; 10 s ) differed from the one used with the robot ( 4 kHz; 70 dB; 10 s ) , residual effects were observed in the ChR2 group during the habituation session and the first block of conditioning ( Figure 4C ) . During conditioning , both ChR2 and control groups exhibited a gradual increase in freezing as the trials progressed ( Figure 4B ) . However , consistent with the previous experiment with the robot , the Jaws group showed significantly lower levels of freezing compared to the other two groups . Moreover , although some high flight scores were observed in the ChR2 group during the first block of trials , all three groups exhibited equivalently low levels of fleeing responses as trials progressed ( Figure 4C ) . When fear memory was tested 24 hr later , ChR2-expressing mice displayed significantly more freezing compared to both control and Jaws-expressing mice ( Figure 4D ) . The Jaws and control groups exhibited similar levels of freezing , with no significant difference between the two groups . In terms of fleeing response , since all three groups demonstrated minimal fleeing responses , there was no significant difference observed ( Figure 4E ) . These data show that the same CGRP stimulation did not promote fleeing responses; however , with footshock as in the US , the freezing response observed during conditioning was intensified in the retention test . Overall , additional activation of CGRP neurons enhances fear learning and memory , resulting in conditioned fleeing responses following robot chasing and conditioned freezing responses after footshock . To further investigate whether the previously observed fleeing responses with additional CGRP activation in the presence of the robot ( Figure 3C ) were due to the intensified perception of the US threat , we systematically escalated the threat level of the US by increasing the robot’s speed without manipulating CGRP activity . The robot speed , ranging from 70 to 90 cm/s , was carefully selected after testing various speeds to ensure that it effectively induced a conditioned response without posing harm to the animals . In the previous experiments , the robot moved at a speed of 70 cm/s , making one-and-a-half turns in the donut maze within 3 s . By increasing the speed to 80 cm/s , the robot made two full turns , and at 90 cm/s , it made two and a half turns within the same time frame . Additionally , we analyzed the correlation between robot speed and the number of physical bumps , revealing a significant positive relationship in which higher robot speeds led to more bumps ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B ) . These findings suggest that the increased robot speed resulted in the animals perceiving a greater threat due to more physical contact . On the conditioning day , all three groups showed equivalent levels of freezing behavior ( Figure 5A ) . However , animals exposed to the highest speed exhibited significantly higher flight scores compared to the other two groups ( Figure 5B ) . Analysis of movement further revealed that animals in the 90 cm/s condition exhibited the highest speeds in response to the CS compared to those in the 70 cm/s and 80 cm/s groups ( Figure 5C ) . On the retention test day , no group differences in freezing were observed between the 70 cm/s and 80 cm/s groups , but 90 cm/s group exhibited significantly lower freezing levels than the other two groups ( Figure 5D ) . In contrast , animals in the 90 cm/s speed displayed a significantly higher number of flight scores compared to the other two groups ( Figure 5E ) . There was a positive correlation between robot speed and fleeing responses , and a negative correlation between robot speed and freezing responses ( Figure 5D and E ) . Furthermore , animals exposed to the 90 cm/s speed exhibited a fleeing response similar to that of those subjected to 70 cm/s robot chasing with CGRP stimulation ( Figure 3C and F ) . Considering the combined results of these experiments , the increased activity of CGRP neurons likely enhances fleeing behavior by amplifying the perceived threat of the US . We next sought to confirm whether CGRP neurons are necessary for inducing active defensive behavior under high-speed conditions . Since Jaws inhibition was insufficient to block fear memory formation ( Figures 3E and 4D ) , we bilaterally injected either Cre-dependent tetanus toxin light chain ( TetTox; AAV-DIO-GFP:TetTox ) for effective silencing by selectively blocking neurotransmitter release , or AAV-DIO-eYFP ( control ) into the PBN ( Figure 6A; Jo et al . , 2020 ) . Mice then underwent fear conditioning with the robot at a speed of 90 cm/s . On the conditioning day , the TetTox group exhibited significantly lower levels of both freezing and fleeing compared to the control group ( Figure 6B and C ) . Moreover , velocity analysis confirmed that the TetTox group , with silenced CGRP neurons , showed little to no fleeing behavior in response to the CS , while the control group exhibited robust flight responses ( Figure 6D ) . This persisted on the retention day , with the TetTox group consistently showing reduced levels of freezing and fleeing compared to controls ( Figure 6E and F ) . These results suggest that CGRP neurons are necessary for perceiving threats and promoting fleeing . Enhancing CGRP neuronal activity , either optogenetically or by increasing threat levels , strengthens fear learning and memory , leading to intensified active defensive behaviors . \n CGRP neurons , known for relaying US information to the forebrain and inducing passive freezing behavior ( Han et al . , 2015 ) , were examined to explore their role in active defensive responses . Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels , we recorded neuronal activity and found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude . Optogenetic activation of these neurons during fear conditioning amplified the perceived threat posed by the US , making it seem more dangerous , while inhibiting them weakened it . The expression of defensive behaviors varied depending on the type of US: under robot chasing conditions , increased CGRP activity made the robot seem as if it were moving faster , driving the animals to flee more during both conditioning and the retention test . In contrast , under footshock conditions , elevated CGRP activity predominantly enhanced freezing responses . Systematically escalating robot speed to simulate higher threat levels strengthened conditioned fleeing responses , whereas silencing these neurons prevented the formation of active defensive behaviors . Overall , our findings indicate that CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system , primarily orchestrating freezing responses but also contributing to active defensive behaviors by intensifying the perception of heightened threats , ensuring responses are adapted to the level of danger . The choice of defensive strategies depends on the perceived severity of the threat ( Fanselow and Lester , 2013 ) . For instance , when an animal detects a predator at a relatively safe distance , freezing is the most likely defensive behavior , as it helps avoid detection . However , as the threat becomes more imminent and threat levels increase , freezing is no longer the optimal choice . At this point , the animal shifts from passive freezing to more active defense , adopting behaviors such as fleeing or , if necessary , fighting . However , most research on CGRP has utilized footshock ( Bowen et al . , 2020; Han et al . , 2015 ) or other aversive stimuli in small arenas ( Kang et al . , 2022 ) , potentially limiting the observation of fleeing responses and leading to a focus on passive freezing as the predominant behavior studied . In our study , we introduced different types of US designed to present an imminent threat . This approach allowed animals to perceive the threat through dynamic sensory inputs , with the distance to the threat being discernible . By incorporating the predator-like robot , we developed a behavioral paradigm that enabled animals to form fear memory while minimizing differences in bumping incidents between groups . Additionally , this paradigm allowed for the observation of two distinct defensive responses to the CS: passive freezing and active fleeing , providing a platform to explore defensive behaviors across varying threat contexts . Recent studies have modified conventional fear conditioning protocols to investigate active defensive behaviors in animals ( Borkar et al . , 2024; Fadok et al . , 2017 ) . One such example is changing the CS to a serial-compound stimulus , where a pure tone is immediately followed by a white noise , inducing freezing and flight responses , respectively . While effective for observing transitions between freezing and fleeing , our electrophysiological data show that CGRP neurons are more excited in response to the US compared to the CS ( Figure 1F and G ) . Thus , altering the type of US is more appropriate for studying CGRP neurons . In addition , the robot allowed us to systematically increase threat levels by adjusting its speed , providing a more controlled approach to studying defensive behaviors . Our results showed that a robot speed of 70 cm/s did not induce fleeing response during the retention test ( Figures 3F and 5E ) ; however , increasing the robot’s speed to 90 cm/s elicited conditioned flight responses in control mice . Moreover , CGRP activation combined with a 70 cm/s robot speed induced flight responses similar to those observed with a 90 cm/s robot speed in control mice . This suggests that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat , thereby promoting active defensive behaviors . We optogenetically inhibited CGRP neurons in animals while they were being chased by the robot during conditioning . During this session , the Jaws group showed less freezing and fleeing compared to the control group . However , the reduced fear responses were not sustained on the retention test day , suggesting that transient inhibition during the chasing was insufficient to suppress the acquisition of fear memory ( Figure 3E ) . It has been reported that a square pulse can cause strong rebound excitation following inhibition ( Chuong et al . , 2014 ) . While ramped illumination reduces the magnitude of rebound excitation , it does not eliminate it entirely , leaving small residual excitation . This residual activity may have contributed to the formation of fear memory despite the inhibition of CGRP neurons . In a subsequent experiment with increased robot speed , we used TetTox to silence CGRP neurons more effectively compared to temporary inhibition . This group consistently showed lower fear responses compared to the control group even on the retention day , indicating a more significant impact on fear learning compared to transient inhibition . However , the progressive increase in freezing levels across trials during conditioning , even with CGRP neurons silenced ( Figure 6B ) , suggests the involvement of other pathways in processing the aversive stimuli . For instance , different populations of CGRP neurons in the parvocellular subparafascicular nucleus of the thalamus also respond to threats and relay negative emotional signals to the amygdala thereby contributing to aversive memory formation ( Kang et al . , 2022 ) . Additionally , the midbrain periaqueductal gray ( PAG ) transmits aversive signals to the amygdala ( Johansen et al . , 2010; Johansen et al . , 2012; Ozawa et al . , 2017 ) and other forebrain structures ( Lefler et al . , 2020; Esteban Masferrer et al . , 2020 ) , ensuring effective expression of defensive responses upon the detection of a threat . Although fear learning can occur through various pathways , our use of optogenetics and TetTox suggested that CGRP neurons contribute to both active and passive defensive behaviors , facilitating responses that are appropriate to the magnitude of the threat . In conclusion , by employing both conventional footshock and a naturalistic paradigm , the present study emphasizes the role of CGRP neurons in facilitating both passive and active defensive behaviors . Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing , and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing , demonstrating their primary role in driving passive defensive responses . However , under heightened threat conditions , such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds , these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat . These findings suggest that CGRP neurons detect and process threats , predominantly driving freezing behavior , while also enabling active responses under heightened danger to facilitate appropriate defensive behaviors aligned with the intensity of the threat . \n We used heterozygous CalcaCre/+ mice , generated by breeding CalcaCre/Cre ( Cat . 033168 ) with C57BL/6 J ( Cat . 000664 ) from Jackson Laboratory . Both male and female mice , aged 3–6 mo , were used in all studies , and no sex differences were observed . Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility on a 12 hr light/dark cycle ( lights off at 7 AM ) with ad libitum access to food and water . All experiments were performed during the dark phase of the cycle under the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Korea University ( KUIACUC-2022–0057 ) . All AAV vectors were prepared as described previously ( Pyeon et al . , 2024 ) . Cre-dependent optogenetic viruses included AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet , AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP , and AAV-DIO-eYFP ( control and unpaired ) . For selective inactivation of CGRP neurons , AAV-DIO-TetTox-GFP was used . Viral aliquots were stored at –80℃ before stereotaxic injection . Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane ( 4% induction , 1 . 5–2% maintenance ) and fixed on a stereotaxic frame ( Model 942 , David Kopf Instruments ) . After exposing the skull , bregma and lambda were aligned on the same horizontal plane . Small burr holes were then made for viral injections and optic fibers , and additional holes were drilled for anchoring screws . Cre-dependent virus ( 0 . 5 µl per side ) was injected unilaterally or bilaterally into the PBN ( 5 . 0 mm posterior , 1 . 5 mm lateral , and 3 . 5 mm ventral to bregma ) at a rate of 0 . 25 µl /min . Microdrives or optic fibers ( 200 µm diameter , 0 . 22 numerical aperture ) were implanted 0 . 3 mm dorsal to the virus injection sites and secured with dental cement . Meloxicam ( 1 . 5 mg/kg ) was administered subcutaneously to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation . Mice were allowed to recover for 2–3 wk before the start of behavioral experiments . Two weeks after surgery , the optic fibers implanted in the mice were connected to optic cables , and the animals were placed in an open arena ( 30 × 22 × 22 cm ) . After 2 min of exploration , CGRP neurons were either stimulated or inhibited four times at 60 s intervals . For activation , 40 Hz of blue light ( 473 nm; LaserGlow ) was delivered for 30 s . For inactivation , continuous red light ( 640 nm; LaserGlow ) was delivered for 3 s followed by a 1 s ramp down , repeated in cycles until a total duration of 30 s . The light output from the bilateral branching cable was set to 9±0 . 5 mW . The animals’ behavior was recorded using a camera mounted on the ceiling of the chamber . Freezing and movement velocities were analyzed using video-tracking software ( ANY-maze , Stoelting Co . ) . Fear conditioning experiment was conducted using a box-shaped robot ( 15 × 26 × 35 cm ) with four high-traction wheels that moved quickly inside a white acrylic track ( 18 cm width ) of a donut-shaped maze ( 60 cm outer diameter ) . The speed of the robot was controlled by a Bluetooth-based microcontroller with a custom-written program in Arduino , and the CS ( 4 kHz; 80 dB; 10 s ) was generated by speakers mounted in the front and back of the robot . Habituation and fear responses to the CS were tested before and after conditioning in a rectangular box ( 30 × 27 × 20 cm ) . The maze and rectangular box were wiped with 70% ethanol between animals . The custom-written program required for the robot’s operation is provided in the source code file 1 . On the first day of fear conditioning paradigm , habituation to the CS was performed . Mice were introduced to the rectangular box and allowed a 3 min exploratory period , followed by the presentation of 4 CSs at intervals of 60 s . During this phase , the chasing robot was positioned outside the rectangular box to prevent the animals from seeing it . On day 2 , optic fiber cables were attached to the head of each mouse , which were then placed in the donut-shaped maze . After 3 min , mice received 10 associations of a 10 s CS , each co-terminating with 3 s of chasing ( speed of 70 , 80 , or 90 cm/s ) with 60 s interval . The robot chased animals at high speeds and posed a physical threat by colliding and pushing them . During robot chasing , CGRP neurons were either activated or inhibited . To optogenetically stimulate , 30 Hz of blue light was delivered for 3 s with the robot . For inhibition , continuous red light was delivered for 3 s followed by a 1 s ramp down with the robot . For the unpaired group , the same number of CSs was presented; however , the robot chased the animals at a random time within the ITI . On day 3 , fear response to the CS was measured . Mice were placed in the same rectangular box used on the first day , and after 3 min , the CS was presented alone 4 times at 60 s intervals . During conditioning procedures , the animals’ behavior was recorded using a camera mounted on the ceiling of the chamber . Freezing and movement velocities were analyzed using ANY-maze . Freezing behavior was automatically detected when movement was absent for at least 0 . 8 s . For fleeing responses , flight score was calculated following previous studies ( Borkar and Fadok , 2021; Fadok et al . , 2017 ) . Speed ( cm/s ) was extracted using the animal’s center body point , and the flight score was measured by dividing the average speed during each CS alone period by the speed during the same length of the pre-CS period . For conditioning trials , the CS alone period was the first 7 s from CS onset , while for the habituation and retention tests , it was 10 s . Vertical movements , such as jumping , were manually recorded by an experimenter blind to the group assignments , with 1 point added to the flight score for each escape jump . The number of times the mice bumped into the robot was manually scored by an experimenter who was blinded to the group assignments of the animals . We divided each group into two to three animal batches and replicated the experiments to confirm the consistency of the results across these batches . A standard fear conditioning paradigm with electric footshock was conducted in four identical chambers ( 21 . 6 × 17 . 8 × 12 . 7 cm; Med Associates ) placed inside sound-attenuating boxes . Each chamber was equipped with two speakers on one wall with 24 shock grids on the floor wired to a scrambled shock generator . Tone habituation and retention test of fear memory was tested in a different context where white plastic panels ( 20 × 16 × 12 cm ) were inserted inside the chamber covering the walls and grids . The chamber and inserts were cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals . After a week of resting period from fear conditioning paradigm with the robot , animals underwent conventional fear conditioning paradigm . On day 1 , mice were habituated to a different CS ( 12 kHz; 80 dB; 10 s ) . The white plastic panels were inserted inside the chamber , and the animals were allowed to freely explore the context for 3 min . The CS was then presented four times with an ITI of 60 s . On the next day , after 3 min of free exploration , the animals received 10 CS–US trials , each co-terminating with a 1 s footshock ( 0 . 3 mA ) with a 60 s ITI . CGRP neurons were either activated or inhibited during footshock delivery . For activation , 30 Hz of blue light was delivered during footshock presentation . For inhibition , continuous red light was delivered for 1 s followed by a 1 s ramp down during footshock presentation . To add a context-specific odor , a petri dish filled with a 1% acetic acid solution was placed under the grid floor . On day 3 , fear memory in response to the CS was tested . As on the first day , animals were placed in the chamber with the white plastic panels , and the CS was presented four times at 60 s intervals . Animal behavior was recorded during the experiments by a camera installed on the ceiling , and freezing and fleeing responses were analyzed afterward . A custom-made microdrive containing four tetrodes ( 20 µm diameter tungsten wire; California Fine Wire ) glued to one optic fiber ( 200 µm core diameter , 0 . 22 numerical aperture ) was used . Tetrode tips were cut to protrude beyond the optic fiber by 400–500 µm and were gold-plated to reach impedances of 200–500 kΩ , tested at 1 kHz . After the recovery period from surgery , individual mice were placed in a holding cage , and single-unit activity was monitored using a Cheetah data acquisition system ( Digital Lynx SX , Neuralynx ) . Neural signals were filtered between 0 . 6 and 6 kHz , digitized at 32 kHz , and amplified 1000–8000 times . To identify ChR2-expressing units in the PBN , 10 blue light pulses ( 473 nm; 5 ms width; 4–10 mW/mm2 intensity; Laswerglow technologies ) were delivered at 30 Hz via the optic fiber . If no light-responsive units were detected , the tetrodes were lowered by 40–80 µm increments , up to 160 µm per day . Once light-responsive units were found , behavioral recording sessions began . During daily recording sessions , spontaneous spikes from PBN neurons were recorded in the home cage for 10 min . Neuronal firing rates were further recorded during fear conditioning sessions over three consecutive days . On day 1 , mice were first habituated to a tone ( 10 kHz , 80 dB , 10 s duration ) as the conditioned stimulus ( CS ) for 10 times . On day 2 , mice underwent 10 exposures to the CS , each co-terminated with an unconditioned aversive stimulus ( US ) consisting of 3 s of chasing by a robot , with an average inter-trial interval ( ITI ) of 100 s . On day 3 , mice were tested for fear retention with 10 presentations of the CS alone . At the end of each recording session , 10 trains of 10 light pulses ( total 100 presentations; 30 s intervals ) were delivered to identify ChR2-expressing CGRP neurons in the PBN . The tetrodes were kept in the same location to compare neuronal responses to the CS across 3 d of conditioning . However , neurons recorded across 3 d were considered independent units rather than the same units . After completing the fear conditioning sessions , neuronal firing rates were recorded in response to three different aversive stimuli: pinprick , tail pinch , and robot chasing . Pinprick and tail pinch were administered by a trained experimenter throughout all recording sessions to ensure minimal variability , as described previously ( Pyeon et al . , 2024 ) . For the pinprick , mice were placed in a white cylindrical Plexiglass container ( 14 cm in diameter , 20 cm in height ) with a plastic grid floor , and hind paws were pinpricked with a 26 G syringe needle ( approximately 0 . 5 s duration ) . For the tail pinch , mice were placed in a rectangular Plexiglass cage ( 27 × 18 × 8 cm ) , and the tail was pinched using forceps ( 1 s duration ) . For the robot chasing , mice were chased by the same robot used in the conditioning sessions but without the predictive CS . After the daily recording session , all tetrodes were lowered by 40–80 µm to find different light-responsive neurons and the mouse was returned to its home cage . Neuronal spikes were isolated based on various waveform characteristics using Offline Sorter ( Plexon ) . Stably firing units throughout the behavioral recording session were further analyzed using MATLAB software ( MathWorks ) . To classify CGRP neurons , peri-event time histograms ( PETHs; 11 . 11 ms bins ) were constructed around the light presentations . Spike probability and latency were calculated for individual units in response to a total of 100 light pulses , and a cluster analysis was conducted on all units . The cluster with the highest spike probability ( >0 . 8 ) and the shortest latency ( <5 . 5 ms ) was identified as CGRP neurons . These neurons also showed higher correlations between spontaneous and light-evoked waveforms , compared with optically insensitive PBN neurons . To further examine responses of CGRP neurons to aversive stimuli , PETHs ( 50 s-ms bins ) were generated around the time of these aversive stimuli . Firing rates in PETHs were converted to z-scores relative to baseline firing rates observed during 3 s period before each stimulus . Average neuronal responses to aversive stimuli were measured during 0 . 65 s window from stimulus onset . After completion of all behavioral experiments , mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) . Dissected brains were post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA , then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C for 72 hr . Brains were frozen and sectioned into 30 µm coronal slices on a cryostat ( CM1860 , Leica Biosystems ) . Sections were mounted on microscopic slides and cover-slipped with DAPI Fluoromount-G ( Southern Biotech ) . Using a fluorescence microscope ( EVOS M5000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , images were taken to examine recording sites , fiber placements , and fluorescent expression levels . Statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software package ( SPSS version 27 . 0 , IBM SPSS , Armonk , NY ) . Statistical tests for electrophysiological and behavioral results were assessed with mixed-design ANOVA that contained within-subjects variables ( e . g . trials ) and between-subjects variables ( e . g . group ) as well as one-way ANOVA across groups . Once significant interactions were observed , Bonferroni corrections were used for post hoc pairwise comparisons . Two-tailed p-values <0 . 05 were considered significant . All data were expressed as mean ± SEM . All statistical results are summarized in the Supplementary file 1 .",

         "If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm , their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat . However , most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses , with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors . To address this , we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice . Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes . Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests , presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous . In contrast , animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses , even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning . These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system , capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception , and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger . In contrast , active defensive behaviors , including fleeing or fighting , enable animals to swiftly escape or confront imminent threats  . The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active defenses in response to varying threat contexts is essential for optimizing survival outcomes , as demonstrated by studies utilizing naturalistic threat stimuli like predator-like robots or looming disks , which allowed the observation of various critical defensive behaviors  . A critical component of this adaptive response is the general alarm signal , which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting appropriate defensive behaviors in the face of threats . In this process , a neutral sensory stimulus  is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus  , leading to a conditioned response  that can be expressed as either freezing or fleeing , depending on the specific features of the CS  and US  . Additionally , these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock  . Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior , demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories  . However , for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system , they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors , whether passive or active . While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established , their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored . To address this , we employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals , thereby incorporating an imminent threat . We hypothesized that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat . We first recorded CGRP neuron activity in response to various aversive stimuli including the robot chasing to determine whether they encode noxious stimuli differentially . We then manipulated CGRP activity—both activating and inactivating—during fear conditioning with robot chasing and footshock . Our results suggest that manipulation of CGRP neurons bidirectionally modulates conditioned fleeing behaviors through altering the perception of the threat . These results highlight the role of CGRP neurons as a general alarm signal , primarily facilitating passive defensive behaviors , while also engaging in active defensive behaviors in response to high-threat conditions . The response profiles of CGRP neurons in conventional fear conditioning with footshock have been well-reported  . However , how CGRP neurons respond to chasing threats has not been established . To investigate the activity of CGRP neurons in response to robot chasing , in vivo recordings using the optical-tagging strategy were performed  . After 2 wk of recovery , neuronal activity was recorded during fear conditioning with a robot over three consecutive days  . The following day , the animals were placed in a donut-shaped maze and presented with the CS 10 times , each paired with an US of being chased by the robot at a speed of 70 cm/s for 3 s . In this behavioral paradigm , animals engaged in both passive and active defensive strategies , as evidenced by freezing and flight responses during conditioning  . Passive behavior was measured by freezing , defined as the absence of movement , while active behavior was represented by flight , quantified with a flight score calculated by dividing the average velocity during the CS by the average velocity during the pre-CS period  . While both responses were observed during conditioning , the test day , conducted without the robot , showed increased freezing and reduced fleeing responses  . To identify CGRP neurons , 10 pulses of blue light  at 30 Hz were delivered 10 times at the end of each behavioral recording session . Out of 183 PBN neurons , 84 cells with a high probability of light-evoked spikes  and a short spike latency  after light onset were classified as CGRP neurons  . Compared to habituation , CGRP neurons showed significantly increased excitation to the CS during conditioning and retention , but only within the first 1 s after CS onset  ; this difference became non-significant starting at 2 s  . Our findings using the robot as the US revealed that CGRP neurons primarily represent US information , albeit to a lesser extent , the onset of US-predictive information . Given that CGRP neurons preferentially respond to the aversive US , we next asked how CGRP neurons encode different types of aversive stimuli . To address this , we monitored the activity of CGRP neurons while the animals received three types of stimuli , each varying in perceived threat intensity:  a pinprick to the hind paw using a needle  ;  a tail pinch 2 cm from the tail base using forceps  ; and  being chased by a robot  . The pinprick caused hind paw withdrawal , and the tail pinch triggered vocalizations  and immediate escaping behavior , indicating the highest threat intensity , whereas the robot chasing prompted only escaping behavior without any vocalization . CGRP neurons showed significantly excited firing that was time-locked to the onset of all three aversive stimuli and maintained this activity throughout the duration of each stimulus . During the tail pinch , which generated the strongest defensive behavior , CGRP neurons exhibited the highest excitation amplitude , ranging from 33 to 98 Hz , with an average of 58 Hz . Taken together , these results indicate that CGRP neurons represent the temporal characteristics and intensity of different aversive stimuli through variations in firing duration and amplitude . To determine whether increasing or decreasing CGRP neuronal activity would induce defensive behaviors other than freezing , we first observed which defensive behaviors were elicited by either stimulating or inhibiting CGRP neurons in the absence of any external stimuli . CalcaCre/+ mice were randomly assigned to groups and bilaterally injected with either AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet for activation , AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP for inactivation , or AAV-DIO-eYFP for control , followed by the implantation of optic fibers over the PBN  . To activate CGRP neurons , mice received 30 s of 40 Hz photostimulation , delivered four times , based on the observed spontaneous firing rate of approximately 43 Hz in response to robot chasing  . However , activation of CGRP neurons immediately induced robust freezing behavior , consistent with previous studies  . These results confirmed that stimulating CGRP neurons without external aversive stimuli generates rapid , unconditioned freezing behavior in mice . We then tested whether manipulating the activity of CGRP neurons during fear conditioning with robot chasing promotes fleeing behavior or amplifies freezing behavior . To effectively enhance the general alarm signal , additional activation of CGRP neurons was applied at 30 Hz during the robot chasing . CalcaCre/+ mice underwent the fear conditioning paradigm in which the CS was paired with the robot chasing  , with CGRP neurons selectively activated  or inhibited  throughout the presentation of the chasing  . In this group , the CS was not paired with the robot chasing; instead , the robot chasing was delivered within the inter-trial interval . This confirms that any observed differences in defensive responses are likely attributable to alterations in CGRP neuronal activity . For the flight score on the conditioning day , the ChR2 group displayed significantly higher levels compared to the other three groups  , while the Jaws and unpaired groups consistently had lower flight scores than the control group . Moreover , the movement speed of the unpaired group during the tone CS did not exceed 3 cm/s , suggesting exploratory rather than defensive behavior in the test environment  . Taken together , these findings suggest that enhanced CGRP activity during imminent threat promotes fleeing behavior during conditioning , sustaining the heightened flight response through the retention test . We next examined whether the same modulation of CGRP neuron activity paired with electric footshock  would also engage in active defensive behavior . After a 1 wk rest period following the conditioning paradigm with the robot , the control , ChR2 , and Jaws groups of mice underwent conventional fear conditioning  . Although the CS used in the conventional fear conditioning  differed from the one used with the robot  , residual effects were observed in the ChR2 group during the habituation session and the first block of conditioning  . However , consistent with the previous experiment with the robot , the Jaws group showed significantly lower levels of freezing compared to the other two groups . These data show that the same CGRP stimulation did not promote fleeing responses; however , with footshock as in the US , the freezing response observed during conditioning was intensified in the retention test . Overall , additional activation of CGRP neurons enhances fear learning and memory , resulting in conditioned fleeing responses following robot chasing and conditioned freezing responses after footshock . To further investigate whether the previously observed fleeing responses with additional CGRP activation in the presence of the robot  were due to the intensified perception of the US threat , we systematically escalated the threat level of the US by increasing the robot’s speed without manipulating CGRP activity . The robot speed , ranging from 70 to 90 cm/s , was carefully selected after testing various speeds to ensure that it effectively induced a conditioned response without posing harm to the animals . Additionally , we analyzed the correlation between robot speed and the number of physical bumps , revealing a significant positive relationship in which higher robot speeds led to more bumps  . These findings suggest that the increased robot speed resulted in the animals perceiving a greater threat due to more physical contact . On the retention test day , no group differences in freezing were observed between the 70 cm/s and 80 cm/s groups , but 90 cm/s group exhibited significantly lower freezing levels than the other two groups  . There was a positive correlation between robot speed and fleeing responses , and a negative correlation between robot speed and freezing responses  . Furthermore , animals exposed to the 90 cm/s speed exhibited a fleeing response similar to that of those subjected to 70 cm/s robot chasing with CGRP stimulation  . Considering the combined results of these experiments , the increased activity of CGRP neurons likely enhances fleeing behavior by amplifying the perceived threat of the US . We next sought to confirm whether CGRP neurons are necessary for inducing active defensive behavior under high-speed conditions . Mice then underwent fear conditioning with the robot at a speed of 90 cm/s . Moreover , velocity analysis confirmed that the TetTox group , with silenced CGRP neurons , showed little to no fleeing behavior in response to the CS , while the control group exhibited robust flight responses  . These results suggest that CGRP neurons are necessary for perceiving threats and promoting fleeing . Enhancing CGRP neuronal activity , either optogenetically or by increasing threat levels , strengthens fear learning and memory , leading to intensified active defensive behaviors . CGRP neurons , known for relaying US information to the forebrain and inducing passive freezing behavior  , were examined to explore their role in active defensive responses . Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels , we recorded neuronal activity and found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude . The expression of defensive behaviors varied depending on the type of US: under robot chasing conditions , increased CGRP activity made the robot seem as if it were moving faster , driving the animals to flee more during both conditioning and the retention test . Systematically escalating robot speed to simulate higher threat levels strengthened conditioned fleeing responses , whereas silencing these neurons prevented the formation of active defensive behaviors . Overall , our findings indicate that CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system , primarily orchestrating freezing responses but also contributing to active defensive behaviors by intensifying the perception of heightened threats , ensuring responses are adapted to the level of danger . However , most research on CGRP has utilized footshock  or other aversive stimuli in small arenas  , potentially limiting the observation of fleeing responses and leading to a focus on passive freezing as the predominant behavior studied . By incorporating the predator-like robot , we developed a behavioral paradigm that enabled animals to form fear memory while minimizing differences in bumping incidents between groups . Additionally , this paradigm allowed for the observation of two distinct defensive responses to the CS: passive freezing and active fleeing , providing a platform to explore defensive behaviors across varying threat contexts . Recent studies have modified conventional fear conditioning protocols to investigate active defensive behaviors in animals  . While effective for observing transitions between freezing and fleeing , our electrophysiological data show that CGRP neurons are more excited in response to the US compared to the CS  . In addition , the robot allowed us to systematically increase threat levels by adjusting its speed , providing a more controlled approach to studying defensive behaviors . Our results showed that a robot speed of 70 cm/s did not induce fleeing response during the retention test  ; however , increasing the robot’s speed to 90 cm/s elicited conditioned flight responses in control mice . Moreover , CGRP activation combined with a 70 cm/s robot speed induced flight responses similar to those observed with a 90 cm/s robot speed in control mice . This suggests that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat , thereby promoting active defensive behaviors . We optogenetically inhibited CGRP neurons in animals while they were being chased by the robot during conditioning . However , the reduced fear responses were not sustained on the retention test day , suggesting that transient inhibition during the chasing was insufficient to suppress the acquisition of fear memory  . This residual activity may have contributed to the formation of fear memory despite the inhibition of CGRP neurons . In a subsequent experiment with increased robot speed , we used TetTox to silence CGRP neurons more effectively compared to temporary inhibition . This group consistently showed lower fear responses compared to the control group even on the retention day , indicating a more significant impact on fear learning compared to transient inhibition . However , the progressive increase in freezing levels across trials during conditioning , even with CGRP neurons silenced  , suggests the involvement of other pathways in processing the aversive stimuli . For instance , different populations of CGRP neurons in the parvocellular subparafascicular nucleus of the thalamus also respond to threats and relay negative emotional signals to the amygdala thereby contributing to aversive memory formation  . Although fear learning can occur through various pathways , our use of optogenetics and TetTox suggested that CGRP neurons contribute to both active and passive defensive behaviors , facilitating responses that are appropriate to the magnitude of the threat . In conclusion , by employing both conventional footshock and a naturalistic paradigm , the present study emphasizes the role of CGRP neurons in facilitating both passive and active defensive behaviors . Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing , and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing , demonstrating their primary role in driving passive defensive responses . However , under heightened threat conditions , such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds , these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat . These findings suggest that CGRP neurons detect and process threats , predominantly driving freezing behavior , while also enabling active responses under heightened danger to facilitate appropriate defensive behaviors aligned with the intensity of the threat . Fear conditioning experiment was conducted using a box-shaped robot  with four high-traction wheels that moved quickly inside a white acrylic track  of a donut-shaped maze  . The speed of the robot was controlled by a Bluetooth-based microcontroller with a custom-written program in Arduino , and the CS  was generated by speakers mounted in the front and back of the robot . The robot chased animals at high speeds and posed a physical threat by colliding and pushing them . During robot chasing , CGRP neurons were either activated or inhibited . For the unpaired group , the same number of CSs was presented; however , the robot chased the animals at a random time within the ITI . After a week of resting period from fear conditioning paradigm with the robot , animals underwent conventional fear conditioning paradigm . On day 2 , mice underwent 10 exposures to the CS , each co-terminated with an unconditioned aversive stimulus  consisting of 3 s of chasing by a robot , with an average inter-trial interval  of 100 s . At the end of each recording session , 10 trains of 10 light pulses  were delivered to identify ChR2-expressing CGRP neurons in the PBN . After completing the fear conditioning sessions , neuronal firing rates were recorded in response to three different aversive stimuli: pinprick , tail pinch , and robot chasing . For the robot chasing , mice were chased by the same robot used in the conditioning sessions but without the predictive CS . To further examine responses of CGRP neurons to aversive stimuli , PETHs  were generated around the time of these aversive stimuli . "

         "The relationship between obesity and human brain structure is incompletely understood . Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30 , 000 UK Biobank participants , we test the hypothesis that obesity ( waist-to-hip ratio , WHR ) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ) , an index of free water , and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ) , an index of neurite density . We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF . The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions , decreased glial density , and high mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptor density . Conversely , the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors . To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) , we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0 . 026 , P = 0 . 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0 . 112 , P < 9×10−4 ) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0 . 05 ) . These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity , whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation . \n Obesity has long been recognised as a preventable risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders such as heart disease and type-2 diabetes . More recently , it has also emerged as an important risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders , linked to both an increased risk of dementia and accelerated age-associated cognitive decline ( Sellbom and Gunstad , 2012 ) . Defined as the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in the body ( González-Muniesa et al . , 2017 ) , the worldwide prevalence of obesity has more than doubled in the last thirty years , making it one of the most important global public health challenges ( Yatsuya et al . , 2014 ) . To date , cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating effects of obesity on the brain have focused almost exclusively on macroscopic aspects of brain structure such as total grey matter volume and cortical thickness . Results in this field were often contradictory: although studies tended to report lower gray matter volume in relation to obesity , some have also observed null or positive associations as described in a meta-analysis by García-García et al . , 2019 , who noted that the likely reasons for this were heterogeneities in brain and obesity metrics , a wide variation in sample size , and poor statistical methodology . However , the emerging consensus indicates that typically studies are reporting negative associations between obesity ( particularly visceral obesity indexed by waist to hip ratio: WHR ) and ( smaller ) total grey matter volume ( Cox et al . , 2019 ) and ( thinner ) cortical thickness ( Caunca et al . , 2019 ) . Notably , this negative association between body mass index ( BMI ) and global grey matter volume has been substantiated in a recent large-scale study conducted in the UK Biobank involving 9652 participants ( Hamer and Batty , 2019 ) . Recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies , including data from 5882 participants and a mega-analysis of 6 , 420 participants from the ENIGMA MDD working group , have also identified a consistent association of obesity with reductions in grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole ( García-García et al . , 2022; Opel et al . , 2021 ) . These associations between obesity and macroscopic features of grey matter structure have also been supported by longitudinal studies . For example , Franz et al . showed that by the age of 64 years , participants whose BMI steadily increased over forty years had thinner cortex in several frontal and temporal brain regions compared to those whose BMI was stable ( Franz et al . , 2019 ) . Other longitudinal studies have shown associations between age-associated increases in BMI and grey matter reductions in the medial temporal lobe ( entorhinal cortex and hippocampus ) and cingulate cortex ( Arnoldussen et al . , 2019; Bobb et al . , 2014 ) . Together with the finding ( Opel et al . , 2021 ) of a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness driven by lower thickness in older participants , this suggests that the negative impact of obesity on the brain accumulates over time . Together , these studies provide robust evidence for an association between obesity and macro-structural features of brain anatomy such as grey matter volume and cortical thickness . However , changes in grey matter volume and cortical thickness can be driven by multiple different underlying processes and our understanding of the microstructural features that underpin this relationship remain largely unknown ( Westwater et al . , 2022 ) . For example , it is currently not known whether obesity-associated differences in grey matter volume relate to changes in the size , shape or number of neurons e . g . neurite density or orientation dispersion within that region or alternately to differences in tissue water content . To date , the only studies to have investigated associations of obesity with brain microstructure have focused on white matter . Interestingly , these have identified obesity-associated differences in a number of different microstructural features of white matter including ( 1 ) obesity-related increases in white matter water content , ( 2 ) reduced myelination , and ( 3 ) lower fractional anisotropy ( Zhang et al . , 2018; Kullmann et al . , 2016 ) . However , whether comparable differences in cortical and subcortical grey matter micro-structure can be observed with obesity are yet to be reported . We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with diffusion-MRI measures of grey matter tissue microstructure at 180 cortical regions and 8 subcortical structures ( bilaterally ) produced using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging ( NODDI ) modelling of data from ∼30 , 000 participants in the UK Biobank MRI cohort . Unlike conventional diffusion MRI which models data acquired at a single diffusion weighting ( shell ) , NODDI requires data collected at multiple different diffusion weightings ( shells ) then exploits the diffusion characteristics that can be observed in different tissue compartments to quantify their respective volume fractions . In this model , diffusion is modelled as isotropic in free water , restricted within neurites , and hindered in the extracellular space resulting in three microstructural metrics: Intracellular Volume Fraction ( ICVF ) , which captures the volume fraction occupied by neurites ( axons and dendrites ) but not cell bodies; Orientation Dispersion Index ( OD ) , which captures the spatial distribution of these processes; and isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ) , which provides a measure of free water index . Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity , we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the SI . Specifically , we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) , and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity , using prior maps of gene expression , cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system . Finally , we then completed two further analyses to explore the potential directionality of the relationship between obesity and brain microstructure . In the first , we we used genome-wide association statistics ( GWAS ) for brain ISOVF and ICVF ( Warrier et al . , 2022 ) , and for WHR ( Pulit et al . , 2019 ) , to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR , and test the secondary hypothesis that the WHR would have a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF . In the second , we produced brain maps for the association of ISOVF and ICVF with C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , a measure of systemic inflammation . Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose ( particularly visceral adipose ) tissue we predicted tighter correlations between maps of CRP and ISOVF than maps of CRP with ICVF . \n We used data provided by the UK Biobank , a population-based cohort of >500 , 000 subjects aged between 39 and 73 years ( Sudlow et al . , 2015 ) and focused on a subset of participants for whom complete multi-modal MRI data were available . Excluding participants with incomplete MRI data resulted in N ∼30 , 000 participants for each dataset . For further details on participant numbers see Appendix 2—table 2 . Six MRI metrics of brain structure were used for correlational analysis with two measures of obesity ( WHR and BMI ) in N∼30 , 000 participants from UK Biobank . WHR and BMI were strongly positively correlated with each other ( r=0 . 428±0 . 009 , P<2×10−16 ) and we therefore focus here on WHR although similar results are reported for BMI in Supplemental Information ( see comparisons in Appendix 2—figures 2 and 3 and Appendix 2—figures 4 and 5 as well as Appendix 2—figure 9 ) . Of the MRI metrics , there was one macro-structural measure ( GM , grey matter volume ) and five micro-structural measures ( MD , mean diffusivity; FA , fractional anisotropy; OD , orientation dispersion; ICVF , intra-cellular volume fraction; and ISOVF , isotropic volume fraction ) . As illustrated in Figure 1a , some of these metrics were strongly correlated , indicating that they represented similar aspects of the underlying cortical micro-structure or tissue composition . For example , FA , OD , and ICVF metrics of neurite density were more strongly correlated with each other than with ISOVF , which is typically interpreted as a marker of tissue free water rather than cytoarchitectonics ( Kamiya et al . , 2020 ) . To address this potential redundancy , we performed a preliminary correlational analysis of all 6 MRI metrics with WHR then focused our subsequent analyses on ICVF and ISOVF , the two complementary MRI metrics that were most strongly associated with WHR . Comparable results for the other 4 metrics are reported in the Supplemental Information Appendix 2—figure 2 . Tissue free water ( ISOVF ) was significantly positively correlated with WHR ( FDR = 5% ) in 136 bilateral regions , concentrated in a prefrontal-temporal-striatal system comprising the prefrontal cortex ( 37 regions ) , superior temporal ( primary auditory ) cortex ( 21 regions ) , basal ganglia ( caudate , putamen , pallidum , accumbens ) , hypothalamus and thalamus . Referencing a database of prior task-related fMRI studies , this anatomical pattern of fMRI activations has been activated by tasks involving reward , auditory and musical functions ( see Appendix 2—figure 3b , c ) . There were also some areas of significant negative correlation between ISOVF and WHR in the lateral and medial secondary visual cortex ( see Figure 1b ) . In contrast , neurite density ( ICVF ) was significantly positively correlated with WHR ( FDR = 5% ) in 152 bilateral regions concentrated in a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system comprising medial and lateral occipital cortex ( 26 regions ) , medial temporal lobe ( hippocampus and amygdala ) , basal ganglia ( putamen , pallidum , accumbens ) , hypothalamus and thalamus ( see Figure 1d ) . This anatomical pattern has previously been activated by fMRI tasks involving episodic memory and navigation ( see Appendix 2—figure 3d , e ) . Maps of ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR were negatively correlated ( r=−0 . 366 , P=2 . 3×10−13 ) ; see Supplemental Information for correlation matrix of all MRI~WHR maps . This suggests that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density . To investigate the basis for these associations of WHR with tissue water content ( measured by ISOVF ) and neurite density ( measured by ICVF ) , we used human brain gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas to identify the individual gene transcripts that were most strongly co-located with each map . To do this , we independently tested 13 , 561 gene transcripts for significant spatial correlation with each map , that is ISOVF~WHR or ICVF~WHR , controlling for multiple comparisons entailed by whole genome analysis with FDR = 5% ( Figure 2 ) . Similar results were obtained by sensitivity analyses of co-location of weighted whole genome expression with maps of the correlations between MRI metrics and BMI instead of WHR; see Appendix 2—figure 7 . The tissue water content map ( ISOVF~WHR ) was significantly positively co-located with 1 , 031 gene transcripts and significantly negatively co-located with 1140 transcripts ( FDR = 5%; spin permutation corrected ) . Enrichment analysis of the genes weighted by their spatial co-location with ISOVF~WHR identified 15 biological processes that were significantly under-represented , and 1 class that was positively enriched , with FDR = 5% to control for 29 , 687 biological processes and 11 , 110 molecular functions tested for enrichment . The most under-represented process was ‘response to interleukin-6’ and the most enriched process was ‘pattern recognition receptor activity’ , both processes linked to the innate immune system . Other under-represented processes involved ‘protein localisation to the Golgi apparatus’ , ‘mitochondrial metabolism’ , ‘taste receptor activity’ , and ‘tau protein kinase activity’ . In contrast , the neurite density map ( ICVF~WHR ) was significantly positively co-located with 1 , 242 gene transcripts and significantly negatively co-located with 1354 transcripts ( FDR = 5%; spin permutation corrected ) . Enrichment analysis of the genes weighted by their spatial co-location with ICVF~WHR identified 20 biological processes that were significantly negatively enriched , and 6 classes that were positively enriched , with FDR = 5% to control for 29 , 687 biological processes and 11 , 110 molecular functions tested for enrichment . The most negatively enriched process was ‘peptidyl-asparagine modification’ and the most positively enriched process was ‘taste receptor activity’ . Other negatively enriched processes included ‘protein kinase C-activating G-protein-coupled receptor ( GPCR ) signalling pathway’ , ‘fatty acid derivative binding’ , and ‘glutamate receptor activity’ . The whole genome weights of association ( vectors of correlations per gene ) with ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR were negatively correlated ( r=−0 . 615 , P<2 . 2×10−16 ) . Thus , the gene transcripts spatially co-located with ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR maps are coupled but biologically distinct . The prefrontal-temporal-striatal system where ISOVF was positively correlated with WHR was co-located with gene transcripts enriched for innate immune and metabolic processes , whereas the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where ICVF was positively correlated with WHR was co-located with transcripts enriched fo ‘G-protein coupled receptor signalling’ , ‘fatty acid derivative binding’ , and ‘glutamate receptor activity’ . To further investigate the brain systems where obesity was strongly associated with brain micro-structure measured by ISOVF or ICVF , we used prior data on human brain distribution of multiple neurotransmitter receptors Hansen et al . , 2022 . Cortical maps of each of 37 neurotransmitter receptors , for example , mu opioid receptor ( MOR ) , were independently tested for spatial co-location with the ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR maps , controlling for multiple comparisons with FDR = 5% . The prefrontal-temporal-striatal system ( ISOVF~WHR ) was significantly ( positively ) co-located with the atlas distribution of five neurotransmitter receptors/transporters: 5HTT , serotonin transporter; D1 , dopamine receptor; H3 , histamine receptor; Mu , opioid receptor; and VAChT , acetyl-choline transporter . In contrast , the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system ( ICVF~WHR ) was significantly ( negatively ) co-located with four neurotransmitter receptors/transporters: H3 histamine receptor; Mu opioid receptor; CB1 cannabinoid receptor; and A4B2 , α4 , β2 nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor . Interestingly , the mu opioid receptor distribution was the most strongly correlated with both ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR , but with opposite signs of association , meaning that regions where WHR correlated with neurite density typically expressed low mu opioid receptor density , whereas regions showing correlations between WHR and tissue water content typically expressed high mu opioid receptor density . We likewise identified the cell-type distributions that were most strongly co-located with each of the ISOVF~WHR or ICVF~WHR maps . We independently tested 31 cell distributions atlases , provided by Lake et al . , 2018 , for significant spatial correlation with each map , controlling for multiple comparisons with FDR = 5% . The ISOVF~WHR map was significantly ( positively ) co-located with the atlas distribution of three glial cell classes: astrocytes , oligodendrocyte progenitor cells , and microglia . The ICVF~WHR map was not significantly co-located with any specific cell-type distribution . The results reported above ( and summarised in Table 1 ) indicate that obesity is associated with coupled changes in two anatomically , transcriptionally and neurobiologically differentiated brain systems , measured using ISOVF and ICVF micro-structural MRI metrics , respectively . On this basis we tested the hypothesis that genome-wide association statistics ( GWAS ) for normal variation in ISOVF or ICVF ( Warrier et al . , 2022 ) were correlated with prior GWAS results for obesity ( Pulit et al . , 2019 ) , indexed by WHR ( see Shungin et al . , 2015 ) . We used linkage disequilibrium score ( LDSC ) analysis to estimate genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF or ICVF . We found a modest , statistically significant positive genetic correlation between ICVF and WHR ( rg=0 . 11±0 . 030 , P<9×10−4 ) , but no genetic correlation between ISOVF and WHR ( rg=−0 . 026±0 . 03 , P=0 . 3 ) ; see Appendix 2—table 2 for details . These results indicate shared effects of genetic variation on obesity ( WHR ) and neurite density ( ICVF ) , but no shared genetic effects on obesity and brain water content ( ISOVF ) . In the final analysis we compared the effects on microstructure of three variables of interest at the same time , WHR , BMI , and specifically CRP , a measure of systemic inflammation . To this end we looked at the pairwise relationships of the maps ISOVF~CRP vs ISOVF~WHR , ICVF~CRP vs ICVF~WHR , etc . ( see Appendix 2—figure 13 ) . Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose ( particularly visceral adipose ) tissue , for CRP we expected tighter correlations between ISOVF maps than ICVF maps . This hypothesis is indeed supported by our findings , the correlation is significantly stronger for the ISOVF maps than the ICVF maps ( CRP-BMI: P<1 . 2×10−5 , CRP-WHR: P<0 . 024 , one-tailed ) . We also find that the WHR and BMI maps are different ( WHR-BMI: P<0 . 05 , two-tailed ) . \n Previous well-powered studies have identified associations between obesity and a pattern of reduced grey matter volume or cortical thickness centred on fronto-temporal cortex and sub-cortical structures . Here , using NODDI modelling of diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼30 , 000 participants in the UK Biobank we have extended these findings to demonstrate associations between obesity ( WHR ) and two measures of grey matter microstucture , ISOVF ( an index of tissue water content ) and ICVF an index of neurite density ( see Table 1 for a summary ) . Similar to previously reported associations with brain grey matter macrostructure , positive scaling of WHR and tissue water content ( i . e . oedema ) was most pronounced within frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical structures . In contrast , we observed a more anterior-posterior pattern of association between WHR and neurite density , with more obese individuals having higher neurite density in posterior compared to anterior brain regions . By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas , we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors ( PRR ) and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives , and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) responses . Interestingly , these regions were also richer in astrocytes , microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells but not any class of neurons; and had high concentrations of some but not all neurotransmitter receptors or transporters tested , for example , histamine ( H3 ) , mu-opioid , D1 , and 5HTT . In contrast , the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where obesity was associated with increased neurite density was co-located with expression of transcripts positively enriched for taste receptor activity and lower fatty acid binding , glutamate receptor activity and other biological processes linked to protein kinase C-activating G-protein-coupled receptor signalling . Interestingly , this system was not co-located with any specific cell class but it was co-located with specific neurotransmitter receptor maps including H3 , Mu , CB1 , and A4B2 , meaning that regions showing the greatest positive scaling between neurite density and WHR showed relatively low expression of receptors linked to feeding , appetite , and energy expenditure . ISOVF and ICVF are weakly correlated ( i . e . independent ) markers of free water and neurite density , respectively . Both are significantly and mostly positively correlated with WHR in brain systems . Obesity-related differences in ISOVF and ICVF were coupled ( negatively correlated ) but also anatomically , transcriptionally , and neurobiologically differentiated from each other ( Table 1 ) . This raises the question: Could these two brain phenotypes have a different causal relationship with obesity ? For example , it is conceivable that the changes in brain water associated with obesity could represent an effect of obesity on the brain , that is WHR→ISOVF , whereas the obesity-related changes in neurite density could represent an effect of the brain on obesity , that is ICVF→WHR . Such a bi-directional mechanistic model of the relationships between obesity and the brain seems somewhat plausible . Obesity is usually caused by changes in eating behaviour and physical activity , which are controlled by brain systems enriched for opioid , dopamine and cannabinoid receptor-mediated signalling . So changes in the brain , indexed by neurite density , could conceivably cause adipogenic eating behaviours and thus obesity . Obesity in turn causes a pro-inflammatory state systemically and blood concentrations of CRP , IL-6 and other cytokines have previously been associated with changed ( increased ) micro-structural MRI metrics of free water ( Kitzbichler et al . , 2021 ) . So inflammation could potentially mediate effects of obesity on the brain tissue water content ( see also Turkheimer et al . , 2022 ) . Our finding that the CRP-WHR map correlation is significantly stronger for the ISOVF maps than the ICVF maps would be consistent with this hypothesis . Using novel techniques for analysis of spatial co-location of whole genome transcript maps and MRI phenotypes to optimise subsequent enrichment analysis of strongly co-located gene transcripts , we found that transcripts co-located with ISOVF~WHR were enriched for IL6 and pattern recognition receptors ( PRRs ) , both implicated in innate immune signalling; whereas transcripts co-located with ICVF~WHR were enriched for taste receptors . This pattern of results is consistent with the model that changes in neurite density associated with obesity might reflect primary brain changes in taste sensation and reward processing that drive consummatory behaviours leading to obesity; whereas changes in brain free water associated with obesity might reflect effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue that drive extravasation and oedema in some brain regions . One limitation of this study is that data was collected at multiple centres and even though we used site as a nuisance regressor there might be unaccounted for non-linear effects . However Duff et al . , 2022 showed that quantities derived from UK Biobank scans at different sites are reliable . It should also be mentioned that the age range of the AHBA donors ( 24-57 years ) is only partially overlapping with the participants in the UK Biobank ( 44-80 years ) . Future studies will hopefully provide a more comprehensive picture of whole brain gene expression as a function of age so that the powerful strategy for linking transcriptional and imaging data that the AHBA dataset has enabled can be extended to gene expression datasets more closely aligned demographically with the neuroimaging dataset of interest . These and other methodological issues relating to alignment of AHBA gene expression data with MRI phenotypes have been rigorously reviewed in detail ( Fornito et al . , 2019; Arnatkeviciute et al . , 2023 ) . Concerning the question whether both brain systems are in operation in the same individual at the same time , we are not aware of any currently available tools that would allow us to actually test this assumption , but it could be an interesting avenue for future work . Another limitation of our study is that it is based on a cross-sectional dataset , and it is therefore impossible to disentangle causally directed relationships with certainty from correlations between MRI and transcriptional phenotypes . We also approached this question by using GWAS data on obesity and each of the two MRI metrics to estimate and test genetic correlations between obesity and ISOVF or ICVF . We found that ICVF was genetically correlated with obesity , but not ISOVF . This result is consistent with the bidirectional mechanistic model , whereby changes in neurite density ( but not brain water ) cause obesity , but it does not prove it . There are many other possible interpretations of a genetic correlation between phenotypes , that is pleiotropic genetic effects on both phenotypes , which do not entail a causal relationship between phenotypes . Further work will be needed to validate this and other causal models of the directional relationships between obesity and the brain , which could be important for future prevention , diagnosis , and treatment of obesity . \n Minimally processed T1- and T2-FLAIR- weighted MRI data ( and DWI data ) were downloaded from UK Biobank ( https://biobank . ctsu . ox . ac . uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri . pdf ) . The acquisition of these MRI data has been described in detail in Alfaro-Almagro et al . , 2018 , and is summarised here . MRI data at all three sites were collected on a 3T Siemens Skyra scanner ( Siemens , Munich , Germany ) using a 32-channel receive head coil . T1-weighted images were acquired using a 3D MPRAGE sequence with the following key parameters; voxel size 1mm × 1mm × 1mm , TI/TR = 880/2000 ms , field-of-view = 208 × 256 × 256 matrix , scanning duration = 5 min . The diffusion weighted imaging data were acquired using a monopolar Steejskal-Tanner pulse sequence and multi-shell acquisition ( b=0 s/mm2 , b=1 . 000 s/mm2 , b=2 . 000 s/mm2 ) with the following key parameters; voxel size 2mm × 2mm × 2mm , TE/TR = 92/3600 ms , field-of-view = 104 × 104 × 72 matrix , and scanning duration = 7 minutes ( Alfaro-Almagro et al . , 2018 ) . Minimal processing for diffusion weighted imaging ( DWI ) data included correction for eddy currents ( Andersson and Sotiropoulos , 2015; Andersson and Sotiropoulos , 2016 ) , head motion , outlier-slices removal and gradient distortion correction ( Alfaro-Almagro et al . , 2018 ) . We used T1-weighted and T2-weighted scans for the Freesurfer anatomical image reconstruction , because this approach improves anatomical reconstruction ( Glasser et al . , 2013 ) . However , subjects without T2 scans had cortical thickness systematically biased towards lower values compared to subjects with both T1 and T2 images . Thus , we excluded participants without T2 scans from all analyses . In order to avoid spurious effects from pathologies causing systemic inflammation , we also excluded subjects with high CRP ( > ) . We repeated the analysis without subjects who had reported an episode of stroke or diagnosis of dementia , producing identical results . A detailed description of the full processing pipeline can be found in Supplemental Information Appendix 2; briefly , it comprised the following steps: Load and match UKB imaging data with sociodemographic and health data . Regress imaging modalities from NODDI dataset onto waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) with age , sex , scan quality , and scan site as nuisance regressors . This is done for males and females at the same time , but including sex as a covariate ( for sensitivity analysis separating by sex see Appendix 2—figure 3 ) . Adopting the pseudo-code format used by the R statistical language , the regression formula was: ISOVF+ICVF∼WHR+Age+Sex+Quality+Site where Quality is quantified by the Freesurfer Euler number ( a higher number means more surface reconstruction errors ) and Site was one of three sites encoded as categorical variable . The terms on the left can be represented as matrices having Nsubjects rows and NROIs columns , whereas the terms on the right are vectors with Nsubjects entries . Then for each term on the left ( ie . imaging modality ) the result is a matrix of t-statistics or p-values with dimension Ncovariates×NROIs . The relevant row from this matrix is the one relating to the WHR coefficient which can be plotted as a brain map as shown in Figure 1 and Appendix 2—figure 3 for each imaging modality , respectively . Hansen et al . , 2022 compiled 37 neurotransmitter receptor atlases from the literature and provided them as 3D volumes in MNI space . These were then parcellated in the same way as the imaging data ( using the Glasser HCP template ) . We independently tested the resulting 37 neurotransmitter maps ( Appendix 2—figure 11 ) for significant spatial correlation with the MRI~WHR maps , controlling for spatial autocorrelation using 10 , 000 spin permutations and correcting for multiple comparisons with FDR = 5% . Maps for the same receptor from different literature sources were correlated independently but the results were combined , resulting in the 19 separate receptors shown in Figure 3 ( see Appendix 2—figure 9 for a sensitivity analysis using the original 37 maps individually ) . We used genome-wide association statistics for ICVF and ISOVF ( Warrier et al . , 2022 ) , and for waist-to-hip ratio ( plain and adjusted for BMI; Pulit et al . , 2019 ) . Genetic correlations were estimated using linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) score regression ( Bulik-Sullivan et al . , 2015 ) based on LD information from North-West European populations .",

         "Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ∼30 , 000 UK Biobank participants , we test the hypothesis that obesity  is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction  , an index of free water , and intra-cellular volume fraction  , an index of neurite density . We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF . The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions , decreased glial density , and high mu opioid  and other neurotransmitter receptor density . Conversely , the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors . To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein  , we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF  and ICVF  as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF  . These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity , whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation . To date , cross-sectional and longitudinal studies investigating effects of obesity on the brain have focused almost exclusively on macroscopic aspects of brain structure such as total grey matter volume and cortical thickness . Recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies , including data from 5882 participants and a mega-analysis of 6 , 420 participants from the ENIGMA MDD working group , have also identified a consistent association of obesity with reductions in grey matter volume and cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex and the temporal pole  . Together with the finding  of a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness driven by lower thickness in older participants , this suggests that the negative impact of obesity on the brain accumulates over time . Interestingly , these have identified obesity-associated differences in a number of different microstructural features of white matter including  obesity-related increases in white matter water content ,  reduced myelination , and  lower fractional anisotropy  . We hypothesized that obesity would be associated with diffusion-MRI measures of grey matter tissue microstructure at 180 cortical regions and 8 subcortical structures  produced using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging  modelling of data from ∼30 , 000 participants in the UK Biobank MRI cohort . Given previous findings of significant association between macroscopic differences in brain structure and visceral obesity , we elected to report associations with WHR in the main text and report complementary results for BMI as a measure of whole body obesity in the SI . Specifically , we tested each metric at each region for association with waist-to-hip ratio  , and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity , using prior maps of gene expression , cellular composition and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine functional characterization of each obesity-associated system . In the first , we we used genome-wide association statistics  for brain ISOVF and ICVF  , and for WHR  , to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR , and test the secondary hypothesis that the WHR would have a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF . Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose  tissue we predicted tighter correlations between maps of CRP and ISOVF than maps of CRP with ICVF . WHR and BMI were strongly positively correlated with each other  and we therefore focus here on WHR although similar results are reported for BMI in Supplemental Information  . For example , FA , OD , and ICVF metrics of neurite density were more strongly correlated with each other than with ISOVF , which is typically interpreted as a marker of tissue free water rather than cytoarchitectonics  . To address this potential redundancy , we performed a preliminary correlational analysis of all 6 MRI metrics with WHR then focused our subsequent analyses on ICVF and ISOVF , the two complementary MRI metrics that were most strongly associated with WHR . Tissue free water  was significantly positively correlated with WHR  in 136 bilateral regions , concentrated in a prefrontal-temporal-striatal system comprising the prefrontal cortex  , superior temporal  cortex  , basal ganglia  , hypothalamus and thalamus . There were also some areas of significant negative correlation between ISOVF and WHR in the lateral and medial secondary visual cortex  . In contrast , neurite density  was significantly positively correlated with WHR  in 152 bilateral regions concentrated in a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system comprising medial and lateral occipital cortex  , medial temporal lobe  , basal ganglia  , hypothalamus and thalamus  . Maps of ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR were negatively correlated  ; see Supplemental Information for correlation matrix of all MRI~WHR maps . To investigate the basis for these associations of WHR with tissue water content  and neurite density  , we used human brain gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas to identify the individual gene transcripts that were most strongly co-located with each map . To do this , we independently tested 13 , 561 gene transcripts for significant spatial correlation with each map , that is ISOVF~WHR or ICVF~WHR , controlling for multiple comparisons entailed by whole genome analysis with FDR = 5%  . Similar results were obtained by sensitivity analyses of co-location of weighted whole genome expression with maps of the correlations between MRI metrics and BMI instead of WHR; see Appendix 2—figure 7 . Enrichment analysis of the genes weighted by their spatial co-location with ISOVF~WHR identified 15 biological processes that were significantly under-represented , and 1 class that was positively enriched , with FDR = 5% to control for 29 , 687 biological processes and 11 , 110 molecular functions tested for enrichment . Enrichment analysis of the genes weighted by their spatial co-location with ICVF~WHR identified 20 biological processes that were significantly negatively enriched , and 6 classes that were positively enriched , with FDR = 5% to control for 29 , 687 biological processes and 11 , 110 molecular functions tested for enrichment . The whole genome weights of association  with ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR were negatively correlated  . Thus , the gene transcripts spatially co-located with ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR maps are coupled but biologically distinct . The prefrontal-temporal-striatal system where ISOVF was positively correlated with WHR was co-located with gene transcripts enriched for innate immune and metabolic processes , whereas the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where ICVF was positively correlated with WHR was co-located with transcripts enriched fo ‘G-protein coupled receptor signalling’ , ‘fatty acid derivative binding’ , and ‘glutamate receptor activity’ . To further investigate the brain systems where obesity was strongly associated with brain micro-structure measured by ISOVF or ICVF , we used prior data on human brain distribution of multiple neurotransmitter receptors Hansen et al . Cortical maps of each of 37 neurotransmitter receptors , for example , mu opioid receptor  , were independently tested for spatial co-location with the ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR maps , controlling for multiple comparisons with FDR = 5% . The prefrontal-temporal-striatal system  was significantly  co-located with the atlas distribution of five neurotransmitter receptors/transporters: 5HTT , serotonin transporter; D1 , dopamine receptor; H3 , histamine receptor; Mu , opioid receptor; and VAChT , acetyl-choline transporter . In contrast , the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system  was significantly  co-located with four neurotransmitter receptors/transporters: H3 histamine receptor; Mu opioid receptor; CB1 cannabinoid receptor; and A4B2 , α4 , β2 nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor . Interestingly , the mu opioid receptor distribution was the most strongly correlated with both ISOVF~WHR and ICVF~WHR , but with opposite signs of association , meaning that regions where WHR correlated with neurite density typically expressed low mu opioid receptor density , whereas regions showing correlations between WHR and tissue water content typically expressed high mu opioid receptor density . We likewise identified the cell-type distributions that were most strongly co-located with each of the ISOVF~WHR or ICVF~WHR maps . The ISOVF~WHR map was significantly  co-located with the atlas distribution of three glial cell classes: astrocytes , oligodendrocyte progenitor cells , and microglia . The ICVF~WHR map was not significantly co-located with any specific cell-type distribution . The results reported above  indicate that obesity is associated with coupled changes in two anatomically , transcriptionally and neurobiologically differentiated brain systems , measured using ISOVF and ICVF micro-structural MRI metrics , respectively . On this basis we tested the hypothesis that genome-wide association statistics  for normal variation in ISOVF or ICVF  were correlated with prior GWAS results for obesity  , indexed by WHR  . We used linkage disequilibrium score  analysis to estimate genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF or ICVF . We found a modest , statistically significant positive genetic correlation between ICVF and WHR  , but no genetic correlation between ISOVF and WHR  ; see Appendix 2—table 2 for details . These results indicate shared effects of genetic variation on obesity  and neurite density  , but no shared genetic effects on obesity and brain water content  . To this end we looked at the pairwise relationships of the maps ISOVF~CRP vs ISOVF~WHR , ICVF~CRP vs ICVF~WHR , etc . Given the pro-inflammatory properties of adipose  tissue , for CRP we expected tighter correlations between ISOVF maps than ICVF maps . Here , using NODDI modelling of diffusion-weighted MRI data from ∼30 , 000 participants in the UK Biobank we have extended these findings to demonstrate associations between obesity  and two measures of grey matter microstucture , ISOVF  and ICVF an index of neurite density  . Similar to previously reported associations with brain grey matter macrostructure , positive scaling of WHR and tissue water content  was most pronounced within frontal and temporal cortices and subcortical structures . In contrast , we observed a more anterior-posterior pattern of association between WHR and neurite density , with more obese individuals having higher neurite density in posterior compared to anterior brain regions . By relating obesity associated grey matter microstructure maps to gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas , we show that regions where WHR was more tightly linked to tissue water content had greater expression of pattern recognition receptors  and receptors for binding fatty acid derivatives , and reduced expression of genes associated with biological processes linked to interleukin-6  responses . In contrast , the medial temporal-occipital-striatal system where obesity was associated with increased neurite density was co-located with expression of transcripts positively enriched for taste receptor activity and lower fatty acid binding , glutamate receptor activity and other biological processes linked to protein kinase C-activating G-protein-coupled receptor signalling . Interestingly , this system was not co-located with any specific cell class but it was co-located with specific neurotransmitter receptor maps including H3 , Mu , CB1 , and A4B2 , meaning that regions showing the greatest positive scaling between neurite density and WHR showed relatively low expression of receptors linked to feeding , appetite , and energy expenditure . Obesity-related differences in ISOVF and ICVF were coupled  but also anatomically , transcriptionally , and neurobiologically differentiated from each other  . For example , it is conceivable that the changes in brain water associated with obesity could represent an effect of obesity on the brain , that is WHR→ISOVF , whereas the obesity-related changes in neurite density could represent an effect of the brain on obesity , that is ICVF→WHR . Our finding that the CRP-WHR map correlation is significantly stronger for the ISOVF maps than the ICVF maps would be consistent with this hypothesis . Using novel techniques for analysis of spatial co-location of whole genome transcript maps and MRI phenotypes to optimise subsequent enrichment analysis of strongly co-located gene transcripts , we found that transcripts co-located with ISOVF~WHR were enriched for IL6 and pattern recognition receptors  , both implicated in innate immune signalling; whereas transcripts co-located with ICVF~WHR were enriched for taste receptors . This pattern of results is consistent with the model that changes in neurite density associated with obesity might reflect primary brain changes in taste sensation and reward processing that drive consummatory behaviours leading to obesity; whereas changes in brain free water associated with obesity might reflect effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by adipose tissue that drive extravasation and oedema in some brain regions . We also approached this question by using GWAS data on obesity and each of the two MRI metrics to estimate and test genetic correlations between obesity and ISOVF or ICVF . We found that ICVF was genetically correlated with obesity , but not ISOVF . Adopting the pseudo-code format used by the R statistical language , the regression formula was: ISOVF+ICVF∼WHR+Age+Sex+Quality+Site where Quality is quantified by the Freesurfer Euler number  and Site was one of three sites encoded as categorical variable . We independently tested the resulting 37 neurotransmitter maps  for significant spatial correlation with the MRI~WHR maps , controlling for spatial autocorrelation using 10 , 000 spin permutations and correcting for multiple comparisons with FDR = 5% .

         "Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models . However , tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens , leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain . We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that , alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin , identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines . This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours . Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours , we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens . Through training an artificial neural network , these predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ) . In this study , we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens , and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease . \n In multiple types of carcinoma , cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour ( Biddle et al . , 2011; Lawson et al . , 2015; Liu et al . , 2014; Ruscetti et al . , 2016 ) . This model of metastatic dissemination has been built from studies using murine models and human cancer cell line models . However , this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting , leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis ( Bill and Christofori , 2015; Williams et al . , 2019 ) . A key complication with efforts to study metastatic processes in human tumours is the inability to trace cell lineage . As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT , they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour ( Li and Kang , 2016 ) . Therefore , once these cells detach from the tumour body and move away they are lost to analysis . Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours ( Bronsert et al . , 2014; Jensen et al . , 2015; Puram et al . , 2017 ) . However , these studies were limited to characterising cells undergoing the earliest stages of EMT whilst still attached to the cohesive body of the primary tumour . EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites , and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs ( Ocaña et al . , 2012; Tsai et al . , 2012 ) . We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens ( Biddle et al . , 2016; Biddle et al . , 2011 ) . We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM ( Biddle et al . , 2011 ) and CD24 ( Biddle et al . , 2016 ) in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT . Both EpCAM and CD24 were individually associated with enhanced ability to undergo MET , and thus are markers of EMT CSCs exhibiting retained plasticity . We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens , and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding . Here , we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens . Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours , stratified on metastatic status , identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours . Using an image-based machine learning approach , we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis . \n The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens , as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region . In combination with EpCAM , we stained tumour specimens for CD24 as a second marker of plastic EMT CSCs , and Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker to identify cells that have undergone EMT . Notably , CD44 cannot be used as an EMT marker in the context of intact tissue as it requires trypsin degradation in order to yield differential expression in EMT and epithelial populations ( Biddle et al . , 2013; Mack and Gires , 2008 ) . Vimentin , on the other hand , accurately distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells in immunofluorescent staining protocols ( Biddle et al . , 2016 ) . By combining EpCAM as a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker , Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker , and CD24 as a plastic EMT CSC marker , we aimed to identify tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region . For this , we developed a protocol for automated four-colour ( three markers +nuclear stain ) immunofluorescent imaging and analysis of entire histopathological slide specimens , to test for co-localisation of the three markers in each individual cell across each specimen . To determine whether this marker combination identifies EMT CSCs , we initially tested the protocol on the CA1 OSCC cell line and an EMT CSC sub-line that is a derivative of this cell line ( EMT-stem sub-line; Biddle et al . , 2016 ) . EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were greatly enriched in the EMT-stem sub-line , comprising 41% of the population , compared to 2 . 1% in the CA1 line ( Figure 1A , B and E ) . Cells with this staining profile were absent from normal keratinocyte culture and cancer associated fibroblast culture ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . To test the specific role of EpCAM retention , we replaced EpCAM with a pan-keratin antibody against epithelial keratins . There was very little Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ staining , and no enrichment for Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ cells in the EMT-stem sub-line ( Figure 1C , D and E ) . Therefore , whilst epithelial keratins are lost , EpCAM is retained in cells undergoing EMT and an EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ staining profile can be used as a marker for EMT CSCs in immunofluorescent staining protocols . Imaging the tumour body and adjacent stroma in sections of human OSCC specimens , we detected single cells co-expressing EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 in the stromal region surrounding the tumour ( Figure 1F ) , confirming that these cells can be detected in human tumour specimens . We next stratified 24 human primary OSCC specimens into 12 tumours that had evidence of lymph node metastasis or perineural spread , and 12 that remained metastasis free ( Supplementary file 1 ) , and stained them for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 . Single cells co-expressing EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 were abundant in the stroma surrounding metastatic tumours . This was not the case in non-metastatic tumours or normal epithelial regions ( Figure 2 , A-C ) . In contrast to EpCAM , pan-keratin staining did not identify cells in the stroma surrounding metastatic tumours ( Figure 2D ) . We developed an image segmentation protocol that separated the tumour body from the adjacent stroma , thus enabling each nucleated cell to be assigned to either the tumour or stromal region in automated image analysis ( Figure 2E ) . Expression of EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 was then analysed for every nucleated cell in every imaging field that included both tumour and stroma ( 3500 manually curated imaging fields across the 24 tumours ) . This enabled the proportion of each cell type in each region to be quantified ( Figure 2F ) . EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were enriched in the stroma compared to the tumour body , and there was a much greater accumulation of EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in the stroma of metastatic tumours compared to non-metastatic tumours . Interestingly , this was not the case for EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells , which were also enriched in the stroma but showed no difference between metastatic and non-metastatic tumours . Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ cells were not detected . To extend this analysis , we stained and imaged a further 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 additional tumours , stratified on the same criteria . These displayed the same evidence of individual disseminating cells co-expressing EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 in metastatic tumours only ( Figure 2G and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . For these tumours , using a variation on the previous image segmentation protocol ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D ) , the proportion of EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ and EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells was quantified for each cell in over 9000 imaging fields at the tumour-stroma boundary ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3E ) . Consistent with the previous set of tumours , only EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were specifically enriched in the stroma of metastatic tumours . To explore whether these EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in the stroma may in fact be non-tumour cell types , we analysed a published scRNAseq dataset for human head and neck cancer ( Puram et al . , 2017 ) . In this dataset , tumour and non-tumour cells were separated using bioinformatic techniques ( principally inferred CNV and a ‘tumour-epithelial’ expression signature ) . Analysing this dataset for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 co-expression , we found that 12% of tumour cells ( 267/2215 ) were EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ . In the non-tumour cells , only 0 . 8% ( 29/3687 ) were EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . Therefore , the observed EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in our tumour specimens are highly likely to be a tumour cell population . Indeed , use of EpCAM as a tumour lineage marker is specifically intended to exclude staining for stromal constituents . EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker , that is not expressed in stromal or immune cells – it is expressed exclusively in epithelia and epithelial-derived tumours ( Keller et al . , 2019 ) . These findings demonstrate that an EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ staining profile marks tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding stroma , and that these cells are enriched specifically in metastatic tumours . The presence of disseminating tumour cells that express EpCAM but not CD24 did not correlate with metastasis . This highlights a requirement for the plasticity marker CD24 , when identifying disseminating metastatic CSCs . OSCC are an important health burden and one of the top ten cancers worldwide , with over 300 , 000 cases annually and a 50% 5-year survival rate . There is frequent metastatic spread to the lymph nodes of the neck; this is the single most important predictor of outcome and an important factor in treatment decisions ( Sano and Myers , 2007 ) . If spread to the lymph nodes is suspected , OSCC resection is accompanied by neck dissection to remove the draining lymph nodes , a procedure with significant morbidity . At presentation it is currently very difficult to determine which tumours are metastatic and this results in sub-optimal tailoring of treatment decisions . Accurate prediction of metastasis would therefore have great potential to improve clinical management of the disease to reduce both mortality and treatment-related morbidity . We sought to determine whether the EpCAM+CD24+Vim+ staining pattern could be predictive of metastasis . Starting with the EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels for each nucleated cell , we used a supervised machine learning approach to predict whether an imaging field comes from a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour ( Figure 3A ) . As a benchmark we used the pan-keratin , Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels , as we hypothesised that pan-keratin would provide an inferior predictive value than EpCAM given that there was no dissemination of pan-keratin expressing cells in the stroma . A total of 3500 imaging fields containing 2 , 640 , 000 total nucleated cells from 24 tumour specimens were used in the machine learning task . We compared the performance accuracy ( 10-fold cross-validated F-score ) of different machine learning classification algorithms . The best performing classifiers for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 were the artificial neural network ( ANN ) and support vector machine ( SVM ) , with F1 accuracy scores of 91% and 87% respectfully ( Figure 3B ) . For the ANN , the area under the curve ( AUC ) accuracy score was 87% , with 94% sensitivity and 82% specificity . Training with Pan-keratin , Vimentin and CD24 gave much worse prediction across all classifiers ( Figure 3C ) . These findings demonstrate that , utilising a machine learning algorithm , staining for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 can predict metastatic status with high accuracy and may therefore have clinical utility . To further investigate its utility for metastasis prediction , we applied our trained ANN to an independent cohort of tumours in a blinded analysis . We stained and imaged 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 tumours , stratified on the same criteria as the previous cohort , for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 . We conducted a blinded test of 10 fields of view from each slide , to determine whether the ANN trained using the previous 24 specimens could predict the metastatic status of these new specimens . Taking the majority prediction from the 10 fields of view from each slide , the ANN correctly predicted metastatic status for 54/59 slides ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Next , we determined whether the increased input available from this new cohort could yield improved predictive accuracy . Over 9000 imaging fields at the tumour-stroma boundary , containing over 8 . 5 million nucleated cells , were fed into a new ANN machine learning task . For this task , we recorded the predictive accuracy from the training and validation sets after each training round ( ‘epoch’ ) , which showed good alignment and an 89% accuracy score after 12 training epochs ( Figure 3D ) . Interestingly , this is a similar accuracy to the previous ANN trained using 3500 imaging fields from 24 specimens , suggesting that feeding more imaging data into the ANN may only improve prediction up to a point . Finally , to test whether an imaging-based machine learning approach provides increased predictive accuracy over simpler approaches , we compared our ANN trained using image pixel intensity values to ANNs trained using summary data . These were trained using the CD24+EpCAM+VIM+-positive cell counts for each field of view , separated into tumour body and stroma using our imaging segmentation pipeline ( Figure 2E and F ) . We used a dummy ANN fed with random gaussian signals as a baseline . The resulting ROC curves ( Figure 3E ) demonstrate that only the ANN trained using image pixel intensity values has predictive utility in our cohort . To our knowledge , this is the first time immunofluorescent staining of human tumour tissue specimens has been used in a machine learning pipeline for clinical prediction . Previous studies using cytokeratin immunohistochemistry , clinicopathological data and serum biomarkers for clinical prediction via machine learning have achieved AUCs of 75% in breast cancer ( Tseng et al . , 2019 ) , 80% in OSCC ( Bur et al . , 2019 ) , and 82% in colorectal cancer ( Takamatsu et al . , 2019 ) . \n The role of EMT in tumour dissemination has long been debated but , lacking evidence of cells undergoing EMT whilst disseminating from human tumours in vivo , this role has had to be inferred from mouse models and human cell line models . Here , through applying our understanding of EMT cancer cell heterogeneity and markers for EMT CSCs , we have identified EMT CSCs disseminating from the primary tumour in human pathological specimens . Importantly , the presence of these disseminating stem cells is strongly correlated with tumour metastasis . Using an image-based machine learning approach , we have demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs . A partial EMT state has previously been identified in an OSCC scRNAseq dataset; this state retained epithelial gene expression alongside expression of mesenchymal genes , and was correlated with nodal metastasis and adverse pathological features ( Puram et al . , 2017 ) . Now , using immunofluorescent staining for EMT CSCs that retain the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24 , we have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours . However , epithelial keratins are not retained . We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis . There is a requirement for CD24 , which we have previously shown to be a plasticity marker within the EMT population even when driven into full morphological EMT under TGFβ treatment ( Biddle et al . , 2016 ) . This suggests that the EMT CSC state may be more complex than a simple coalescence of epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics . Image-based machine learning approaches employ a greater range of inputs to develop their predictions , and therefore often achieve greater predictive accuracy than machine learning approaches that use simpler data inputs . This comes at the cost of increased computing requirements and reduced ability to decode the learning process ( the so-called ‘black box’ ) , but in our study the image-based approach proved essential to achieve high predictive accuracy . The lack of improvement in predictive accuracy when trained on a collection of 9000 images compared to 3500 suggests a limitation of the ANN , and a possible role for more sophisticated neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) . Whereas the ANN is trained using intensity values for each pixel , a CNN uses the raw image for training . CNNs require many more images for training , but can reach higher levels of accuracy . To support the conclusions of this study , a further blinded cohort and a greater number of tumour specimens would be valuable . This may also enable the application of a CNN to the imaging data to see if it can achieve even higher predictive accuracy than that reported here . We have shown that immunofluorescent antibody co-staining for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 can separate disseminating EMT CSCs from the stromal content of human tumours , a challenge which has confounded previous attempts to develop a predictive EMT signature ( Tan et al . , 2014 ) . We also show that EpCAM+Vim+CD24- tumour cells in the stroma do not correlate with metastasis , and therefore the clinically predictive utility of tumour cell staining in the stroma can be isolated specifically to the EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ EMT CSCs . This highlights the value of using techniques that give single cell resolution , enabling isolation of the signal to the specific cell type of interest within a highly heterogeneous cellular environment . An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours , enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue . This in turn enabled us to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs , and use these to train an ANN to predict metastasis . \n The CA1 OSCC cell line and oral cancer associated fibroblasts were both previously derived in our laboratory , from separate biopsies of OSCC of the floor of the mouth . The EMT-stem sub-line was derived as a single cell clone from the CA1 cell line ( Biddle et al . , 2016 ) . Normal keratinocytes were the N/TERT hTERT-immortalised epidermal keratinocyte cell line ( Smits et al . , 2017 ) . Cell culture was performed as previously described ( Biddle et al . , 2011 ) . Cell removal from adherent culture was performed using 1 x Trypsin-EDTA ( Sigma , T3924 ) at 37 °C . Tumour specimens were obtained from the pathology department at Barts Health NHS Trust , with full local ethical approval and patients' informed consent . Clinicopathological details for tumour cohort 1 are in Supplementary file 1 , and clinicopathological details for tumour cohort 2 are in Supplementary file 2 . Tumour cohort 1 consisted of 24 tumours . Tumour cohort 2 consisted of 54 distinct tumour blocks across 50 tumours . In addition , five tumour blocks were included twice ( with two different sections ) . This made a total of 59 slides for cohort 2 . From the tumour cohort 2 cases listed in Supplementary file 2 , tumours 25 , 28 , 29 , 32 were included as two separate blocks . Tumours 21 , 29 , 32 , 33 , 43 were included twice from the same block . Sections of formalin fixed paraffin embedded ( FFPE ) archival specimens were dewaxed by clearing twice in xylene for 5 min then gradually hydrating the specimens in an alcohol gradient ( 100% , 90% , 70% ) for 3 min each . The sections were then washed under running tap water before immersing the slides in Tris-EDTA pH9 for antigen retrieval using a standard microwave at high power for 2 min and then 8 min at low power . Four-colour immunofluorescent staining was performed by firstly staining the membranous proteins prior to the permeabilisation and blocking steps . The sections were incubated with an IgG2a mouse monoclonal CD24 antibody ( clone ML5 , BD Bioscience ) and IgG rabbit recombinant monoclonal EpCAM antibody ( EPR20532-225 , Abcam ) in PBS overnight at 4 °C ( 1/100 dilution ) . The sections were then washed three times in PBS and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with anti-mouse IgG2 Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 secondary antibodies ( 1/500 dilution ) . The sections were then washed in PBS and permeabilised with 0 . 5% triton-X in PBS for 10 min followed by blocking for 1 hr with blocking buffer ( 3% goat serum , 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS ) . The sections were then incubated with an IgG1 mouse monoclonal Vimentin antibody ( clone V9 , Dako ) and ( optionally , in place of EpCAM ) IgG rabbit polyclonal wide spectrum cytokeratin antibody ( ab9377 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer ( 1/100 dilution ) . After washing with PBS , the sections were incubated with anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 647 antibody and ( optionally ) anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 555 for 1 hr at 4 °C ( 1/500 dilution ) . After washing three times with PBS , cell nuclei were stained with DAPI ( 1/1000 dilution in PBS ) for 10 min . For cell line staining , cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min then washed with PBS . Staining was performed in the same manner as described above , however permeabilisation was performed with 0 . 25% Triton-X for 10 min and DAPI incubation was reduced to 1 min . Imaging of the stained slides was performed using the In Cell Analyzer 2200 ( GE ) , a high content automated fluorescence microscope with four-colour imaging capability . The slides were imaged at x20 and x40 magnification . An image segmentation protocol was developed to extract grey level intensities corresponding to EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 expression for every DAPI stained nucleated cell in the tumour body and the adjacent stroma separately . Segmentation was performed using the Developer Toolbook software ( GE ) . As shown in Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D , an ‘EpCAM dense cloud’ or ‘Vimentin dense cloud’ was generated to isolate individual nucleated cells in the tumour body from the adjacent stroma and analyse them separately . Grey level intensities obtained from the imaging analysis were processed in the following way . Firstly , the median number of nucleated cells was calculated and imaging fields with fewer than 20% of the median nucleated cells were excluded from the analysis pipeline . The folded edges of a specimen were also excluded . The median grey level intensity of the FITC , CY3 and CY5 fluorescence channels corresponding to CD24 , EpCAM and Vimentin expression were computed for the negative control stained slides . A nucleated cell was deemed to have positive CD24 , EpCAM or Vimentin expression if its grey level intensity exceeded the background threshold value ( 1 . 5 x median grey level intensity of negative control slide ) for the FITC , CY3 and CY5 channels , respectively . If a nucleated cell surpassed the background threshold for all three fluorescence channels it was termed a triple positive cell ( CD24+EpCAM+Vim+ ) and denoted with 1 and if this criteria was not met the nucleated cell was denoted with a 0 . For EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells ( termed double positive ) , the nucleated cell must exceed the background threshold for the CY3 and CY5 channels but not the FITC . The scRNAseq dataset ( Puram et al . , 2017 ) was analysed using a threshold ( median or quartile ) using the normalised count expression for EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin for each cell . A dataset was created of a pool of 2 , 640 , 000 nucleated cells across 3500 imaging fields from 24 tumour specimens ( 12 with lymph node metastasis or perineural spread , and 12 without ) ( cohort 1 ) or 8 , 563 , 000 nucleated cells across 9200 imaging fields from 59 tumour specimens ( 29 with lymph node metastasis or perineural spread , and 30 without ) ( cohort 2 ) . The background threshold for the FITC , CY3 and CY5 channels was subtracted from the grey level intensities for each nucleated cell . The supervised machine learning task was to classify each imaging field into whether it belonged to a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour . The dataset was stratified into a training and validation cohort in a 70%:30% ratio using a random seed split . Supervised machine learning approaches were implemented using the skikit-learn Python 3 . 6 libraries ( Pedregosa et al . , 2011 ) and Tensorflow/Keras framework ( https://www . tensorflow . org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models ) . Hyper-parameter optimisation was performed by an exhaustive grid search and computed on Apocrita , a high performance cluster ( HPC ) facility at Queen Mary University of London ( http://doi . org/10 . 5281/zenodo . 438045 ) . To further minimise overfitting , 10-fold cross-validation was performed and the mean accuracy metric , F1 score , was obtained for each learning iteration . Receiver-of-operator ( ROC ) curves and the area-under the-curve ( AUC ) were computed for the optimum supervised learning algorithm . Supervised approaches used were logistic regression , support vector machines ( Smola and Schölkopf , 2004 ) , Naïve Bayes ( Zhang , 2005 ) , K-Nearest Neighbours ( Bentley , 1975 ) , decision trees ( Dumont et al . , 2009 ) , and artificial neural networks ( Rumelhart et al . , 1986 ) . For the blinded analysis of tumour cohort 2 using the ANN trained on tumour cohort 1 , the identity of the tumours was withheld by the pathologists at Barts Health NHS Trust and thus both the model and research team developing the model were blind to the clinical ground truth for the new imaging fields . For each new tumour , a pool of 10 imaging fields were used to make predictions using the previously trained ANN . A majority vote for the 10 imaging fields was obtained and each tumour was assigned either a metastatic or non-metastatic identity by our model . The clinical ground truth was then provided to us by the pathologists to confirm the accuracy of the predictions .",

         "However , tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens , leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain . We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that , alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin , identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines . This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours . Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours , we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM , CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens . In multiple types of carcinoma , cancer stem cells  undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition  to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour  . However , this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting , leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis  . As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT , they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour  . Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours  . EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition  to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites , and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs  . We have previously demonstrated that a CD44highEpCAMlow/- EMT population can be separated from the main CD44lowEpCAMhigh epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma  cell lines and fresh tumour specimens  . We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM  and CD24  in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT . We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens , and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding . Here , we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens . Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12 , 000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours , stratified on metastatic status , identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours . Using an image-based machine learning approach , we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis . The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens , as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region . In combination with EpCAM , we stained tumour specimens for CD24 as a second marker of plastic EMT CSCs , and Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker to identify cells that have undergone EMT . Vimentin , on the other hand , accurately distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells in immunofluorescent staining protocols  . By combining EpCAM as a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker , Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker , and CD24 as a plastic EMT CSC marker , we aimed to identify tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region . To determine whether this marker combination identifies EMT CSCs , we initially tested the protocol on the CA1 OSCC cell line and an EMT CSC sub-line that is a derivative of this cell line  . EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were greatly enriched in the EMT-stem sub-line , comprising 41% of the population , compared to 2 . There was very little Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ staining , and no enrichment for Pan-keratin+Vim+CD24+ cells in the EMT-stem sub-line  . Therefore , whilst epithelial keratins are lost , EpCAM is retained in cells undergoing EMT and an EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ staining profile can be used as a marker for EMT CSCs in immunofluorescent staining protocols . Imaging the tumour body and adjacent stroma in sections of human OSCC specimens , we detected single cells co-expressing EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 in the stromal region surrounding the tumour  , confirming that these cells can be detected in human tumour specimens . We next stratified 24 human primary OSCC specimens into 12 tumours that had evidence of lymph node metastasis or perineural spread , and 12 that remained metastasis free  , and stained them for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 . Single cells co-expressing EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 were abundant in the stroma surrounding metastatic tumours . In contrast to EpCAM , pan-keratin staining did not identify cells in the stroma surrounding metastatic tumours  . We developed an image segmentation protocol that separated the tumour body from the adjacent stroma , thus enabling each nucleated cell to be assigned to either the tumour or stromal region in automated image analysis  . Expression of EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 was then analysed for every nucleated cell in every imaging field that included both tumour and stroma  . EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were enriched in the stroma compared to the tumour body , and there was a much greater accumulation of EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in the stroma of metastatic tumours compared to non-metastatic tumours . Interestingly , this was not the case for EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells , which were also enriched in the stroma but showed no difference between metastatic and non-metastatic tumours . To extend this analysis , we stained and imaged a further 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 additional tumours , stratified on the same criteria . These displayed the same evidence of individual disseminating cells co-expressing EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 in metastatic tumours only  . For these tumours , using a variation on the previous image segmentation protocol  , the proportion of EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ and EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells was quantified for each cell in over 9000 imaging fields at the tumour-stroma boundary  . Consistent with the previous set of tumours , only EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells were specifically enriched in the stroma of metastatic tumours . To explore whether these EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in the stroma may in fact be non-tumour cell types , we analysed a published scRNAseq dataset for human head and neck cancer  . In this dataset , tumour and non-tumour cells were separated using bioinformatic techniques  . Analysing this dataset for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 co-expression , we found that 12% of tumour cells  were EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ . Therefore , the observed EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ cells in our tumour specimens are highly likely to be a tumour cell population . Indeed , use of EpCAM as a tumour lineage marker is specifically intended to exclude staining for stromal constituents . EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker , that is not expressed in stromal or immune cells – it is expressed exclusively in epithelia and epithelial-derived tumours  . These findings demonstrate that an EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ staining profile marks tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding stroma , and that these cells are enriched specifically in metastatic tumours . The presence of disseminating tumour cells that express EpCAM but not CD24 did not correlate with metastasis . Starting with the EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels for each nucleated cell , we used a supervised machine learning approach to predict whether an imaging field comes from a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour  . As a benchmark we used the pan-keratin , Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels , as we hypothesised that pan-keratin would provide an inferior predictive value than EpCAM given that there was no dissemination of pan-keratin expressing cells in the stroma . These findings demonstrate that , utilising a machine learning algorithm , staining for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 can predict metastatic status with high accuracy and may therefore have clinical utility . We stained and imaged 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 tumours , stratified on the same criteria as the previous cohort , for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 . These were trained using the CD24+EpCAM+VIM+-positive cell counts for each field of view , separated into tumour body and stroma using our imaging segmentation pipeline  . The role of EMT in tumour dissemination has long been debated but , lacking evidence of cells undergoing EMT whilst disseminating from human tumours in vivo , this role has had to be inferred from mouse models and human cell line models . Here , through applying our understanding of EMT cancer cell heterogeneity and markers for EMT CSCs , we have identified EMT CSCs disseminating from the primary tumour in human pathological specimens . Now , using immunofluorescent staining for EMT CSCs that retain the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24 , we have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours . We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis . We have shown that immunofluorescent antibody co-staining for EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 can separate disseminating EMT CSCs from the stromal content of human tumours , a challenge which has confounded previous attempts to develop a predictive EMT signature  . We also show that EpCAM+Vim+CD24- tumour cells in the stroma do not correlate with metastasis , and therefore the clinically predictive utility of tumour cell staining in the stroma can be isolated specifically to the EpCAM+Vim+CD24+ EMT CSCs . An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours , enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue . Clinicopathological details for tumour cohort 1 are in Supplementary file 1 , and clinicopathological details for tumour cohort 2 are in Supplementary file 2 . Tumour cohort 1 consisted of 24 tumours . Tumour cohort 2 consisted of 54 distinct tumour blocks across 50 tumours . From the tumour cohort 2 cases listed in Supplementary file 2 , tumours 25 , 28 , 29 , 32 were included as two separate blocks . An image segmentation protocol was developed to extract grey level intensities corresponding to EpCAM , Vimentin and CD24 expression for every DAPI stained nucleated cell in the tumour body and the adjacent stroma separately . As shown in Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D , an ‘EpCAM dense cloud’ or ‘Vimentin dense cloud’ was generated to isolate individual nucleated cells in the tumour body from the adjacent stroma and analyse them separately . A nucleated cell was deemed to have positive CD24 , EpCAM or Vimentin expression if its grey level intensity exceeded the background threshold value  for the FITC , CY3 and CY5 channels , respectively . For EpCAM+Vim+CD24- cells  , the nucleated cell must exceed the background threshold for the CY3 and CY5 channels but not the FITC . A dataset was created of a pool of 2 , 640 , 000 nucleated cells across 3500 imaging fields from 24 tumour specimens   or 8 , 563 , 000 nucleated cells across 9200 imaging fields from 59 tumour specimens   . The supervised machine learning task was to classify each imaging field into whether it belonged to a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour . For the blinded analysis of tumour cohort 2 using the ANN trained on tumour cohort 1 , the identity of the tumours was withheld by the pathologists at Barts Health NHS Trust and thus both the model and research team developing the model were blind to the clinical ground truth for the new imaging fields .

         "Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair . However , the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood . Here , we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds . We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells , including resident Lyve1+ macrophages , during inflammation . Interestingly , human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6 . During early inflammation in mouse wounds , we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms . Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis . By contrast , inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor , Timd4 , in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair . These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients . \n Proper tissue function and homeostasis require efficient and effective repair of injury . Repair of mammalian tissues requires highly dynamic changes in cellular heterogeneity and communication to correctly heal tissue , usually resulting in a scar rather than true tissue regeneration . Cell death is a common event during tissue injury , and several studies from hydra to mice have shown the importance of apoptosis in the initiation of inflammation to drive reparative processes ( Greenhalgh , 1998 ) . Proper initiation and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue repair and progression to the proliferation stage of healing , when fibroblasts , blood vessels , and other tissue-specific cells proliferate and migrate , forming new tissue to repair the wound . While several signaling factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds ( Guerin et al . , 2021 ) , the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and regulate tissue repair are not well understood . The skin is an excellent model to define the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells regulate tissue repair . After injury , mammalian skin undergoes stages of repair beginning with inflammation , which removes debris and pathogens . As inflammation regresses , the proliferative phase leads to the coordination of epidermal keratinocytes , fibroblasts , endothelial , and immune cells to reseal the epidermal barrier and generate a reparative scar including new ECM production and revascularization ( Eming et al . , 2014 ) . Apoptosis occurs after skin injury , and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells – or efferocytosis – by macrophages reduces inflammatory signaling and repair in several tissues ( Bosurgi et al . , 2017a; Peiseler and Kubes , 2019 ) . Yet , it is unclear how apoptosis controls skin wound healing . Apoptotic cell death is characterized by cytomorphological alterations , DNA fragmentation , activation of caspases and other regulators , and finally membrane alterations including outer membrane exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PtdSer ) , which allows the recognition of apoptotic cells by cellular receptors on phagocytes ( Elmore , 2007 ) . The most well-studied receptors that allow phagocytes to bind and phagocytose apoptotic cells include the TAM ( Tyro3 , Axl , and Mertk ) tyrosine kinases and the TIM ( T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain ) family of receptors ( Lemke , 2019 ) . While TIM receptors can directly bind PtdSer , TAM receptors require their ligands growth-arrest-specific 6 ( Gas6 ) and protein S ( Pros1 ) to bind to PtdSer ( Lew et al . , 2014; Elliott et al . , 2017 ) . To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing , we performed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury . We found that transcriptional alterations in apoptotic pathways occur in this interval in fibroblasts , monocytes/macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells . In addition , inhibition of two efferocytosis receptors , Axl and Timd4 , abrogates proper wound repair . The results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during the early stages of wound healing and reveal the essential role of the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells in driving tissue repair after injury . \n To assess cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the wound bed during the inflammatory phase , we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from 4 mm full-thickness biopsy punches on mouse back skin at 24 hr and 48 hr after injury ( Shook et al . , 2016 ) . To ensure that we also captured the immediately adjacent tissue as well as cells that may have migrated into the wound site , we used a 6 mm biopsy punch to collect the tissue before isolating cells using enzymatic digestion ( Figure 1A ) . By training a neural network to identify cell types based on expression of established marker genes ( as in Wasko et al . , 2022; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B ) , we classified four major cell types in the scRNA-seq data , including monocytes/macrophages ( Mono/MO ) , neutrophils ( Neut ) , dendritic cells ( DC ) , and fibroblasts ( FB ) at both timepoints ( Figure 1B–E ) . Surprisingly , the 24 hr and 48 hr samples clustered separately with minimal overlap , suggesting that dramatic changes occurred in the first 2 days of inflammation ( Figure 1B–D ) . The absolute number of macrophages and neutrophils increased >2-fold over this interval ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . While approximately 70% of each of the three immune cell populations was collected at 48 hr , the majority of fibroblasts were found in the 24 hr population ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ) . We also found that genes upregulated by each cell type were markedly different between timepoints ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1E ) , indicating major changes to expression patterns in the same cell type over time . To explore the changes in the major cell types in early wound beds ( fibroblasts , neutrophils , DCs , and monocytes/macrophages ) , we analyzed the genes that were significantly upregulated in each group relative to the mRNAs expressed by the full dataset to determine gene ontology ( GO ) terms that were enriched for each cell type ( Figure 1F ) . Monocytes/macrophages , neutrophils , and DCs upregulated mRNAs involved in their specific function in inflammation for cytokine production , chemotaxis , and antigen presentation , respectively . Similarly , fibroblasts uniquely upregulated genes involved in extracellular matrix ( ECM ) organization . Interestingly , DCs , fibroblasts , and neutrophils upregulated genes involved in apoptosis and cell death ( Figure 1F and G ) . Neutrophils upregulated the largest number of mRNAs for apoptosis including Casp3 , which is cleaved to activate apoptosis , and S100a8 and S100a9 , which induce apoptosis of several cell types ( Yui et al . , 2003 ) . Fibroblasts and DCs also upregulated apoptotic genes ranging from receptors ( Fgfr1 and Bmpr1a ) , cytokines ( Il12b ) , to mediators of apoptotic pathways ( Bcl2l14 and Cth ) . Since apoptosis also involves post-transcriptional activation of several proteins , we sought to confirm that apoptosis occurred during early skin wound inflammation in vivo . Sections of mouse wounds at 24 hr ( Figure 1H ) and 48 hr ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F ) were stained with antibodies ( Abs ) against cleaved ( active ) caspase 3 to detect activation of apoptosis . We found that significantly more cleaved caspase 3+ cells were present in 48 hr wounds ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F ) . We also detected cleaved caspase 3 in CD11c+ dendritic cells ( Figure 1I ) and Pdgfra+ fibroblasts ( Figure 1J ) in 24 hr wound beds . Overall , these data suggest that apoptosis occurs during inflammation after skin injury . Given the upregulation of mRNAs associated with apoptosis and the relatively low level of apoptotic cells in early wound beds , we hypothesized that efficient efferocytosis clears apoptotic cells during inflammation . Initially , we inspected mRNA levels of efferocytosis receptors , their ligands , and downstream factors in scRNA-seq data from 24 hr and 48 hr wounds ( Figure 2A ) . Interestingly , fibroblasts upregulated several genes encoding efferocytosis receptors ( Tyro3 , Axl , Itgav , and Slc7a11 ) , as well as genes encoding for ligands Gas6 , Pros1 , C3 , C4b , and Mfge8 . DCs , macrophages , and neutrophils also upregulated several receptors that mediate detection of apoptotic cells . Macrophages were enriched for the downstream activators Arg1 and Retnla , whereas other cell types upregulated Socs1 and Socs3 , which are downstream of the TAM receptors ( Rothlin et al . , 2007 ) . We noted that Axl’s ligand , Gas6 , and several other genes involved in efferocytosis were expressed predominantly in the fibroblast cluster , but were also lowly expressed in the monocyte/macrophage cluster ( Figure 2A ) . Examining the UMAP plot to determine the heterogeneity of efferocytosis gene expression within individual cell types , we observed that Gas6 was highly expressed by a specific subset of monocyte/macrophage cells . These cells also overexpressed the resident macrophage marker Lyve1 , the apoptosis receptor Timd4 , and Retnla , a downstream factor of efferocytosis ( Figure 2B ) , indicating that they may play a role in apoptosis detection and response in wound healing . Lyve1 has been identified as a marker for resident macrophages , which are distinct from the majority of wound macrophages that differentiate from bone marrow-derived monocytes and are recruited to the wound after injury ( Lim et al . , 2018; Wang et al . , 2020 ) . To confirm the presence of Lyve1+ resident cells in vivo , we used a Lyz2CreER;mTmG mouse model , in which myeloid cells in the bone marrow can be induced to express GFP prior to injury , such that any GFP+ cells observed in the wound bed are interpreted as newly recruited to the site of injury , while GFP- cells are interpreted to be resident to the skin . We observed that Lyve1 was expressed at the protein level both in wound beds ( Figure 2C ) and adjacent to the wound ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) with immunofluorescence staining , and confirmed that these cells were resident rather than recruited to the wound bed after injury , since they did not express GFP . Further , we confirmed that Lyve1+ cells co-expressed Gas6 protein ( Figure 2D ) and that Timd4 protein ( Figure 2E ) was expressed in wound beds . The TAM receptor Axl was uniquely expressed in the single-cell dataset by both dendritic cells and fibroblasts ( Figure 2A ) . Using immunofluorescence staining , we confirmed Axl expression in 24 hr wound beds in both dendritic cells ( CD11c ) ( Figure 2F ) and fibroblasts ( Pdgfra-GFP ) ( Figure 2G ) , which displayed elongated GFP+ processes with central localization of Axl . Thus , while we cannot rule out Axl expression by other cell types in skin wounds , these data are consistent with our single-cell results , confirming that Axl is expressed by fibroblasts and dendritic cells during the inflammatory response of skin repair . We also analyzed mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes by qPCR to determine their expression in wound beds compared to naive skin ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . All efferocytosis receptor mRNAs studied , including the TAM receptors , were significantly upregulated in the wound bed compared to naive skin , while the ligand Gas6 was significantly downregulated . The downstream factor of efferocytosis Retnla was also significantly downregulated in the wound bed , while Socs1 and Socs3 were significantly upregulated . To analyze efferocytosis activity after injury , we intradermally injected labeled apoptotic neutrophils from bone marrow into wound beds 1 , 3 , and 5 days after injury . Wound beds were collected 1 hr after injections , sectioned , and imaged to quantify labeled cells ( Figure 2H ) . We detected and quantified labeled intact neutrophils and efferocytosed neutrophils in wounds at all three timepoints ( Figure 2H–M ) . While wounds at 5 days had significantly more cells undergoing efferocytosis ( Figure 2L ) , the efferocytosis rate was generally constant , with a slight but nonsignificant increase at 3 days ( Figure 2J ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the machinery for multiple efferocytosis pathways are active in the inflammatory and proliferative stages of wound healing . We next set out to explore whether these apoptosis and efferocytosis-related pathways were also relevant in pathological states associated with dysregulated wound healing , such as diabetes . Previous studies have indicated that apoptosis is increased in diabetic wounds , including an elevation in apoptotic lymphocytes ( Arya et al . , 2014 ) . Additional studies have shown that hypoxic environments ( such as those found in diabetic wounds ) increase macrophage efferocytosis ( Wang et al . , 2023 ) , though other studies have indicated that macrophage efferocytosis is defective in diabetic wounds ( Khanna et al . , 2010 ) . To analyze the expression of transcriptional changes in apoptosis and efferocytosis signaling in foot wounds , we analyzed genes in these categories in four non-diabetic and five diabetic human patients ( to be published elsewhere ) . We found several alterations in the expression of mRNAs associated with apoptotic signaling pathways between non-diabetic and diabetic foot ulcers ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . Specifically , monocytes/macrophages increased expression of several apoptosis genes ( including BCL2 , FGFR3 , FGFR1 , CTH , CASP3 , IL19 , NME5 , and S100A8/9 ) in diabetic foot ulcers compared to monocytes/macrophages in non-diabetic wounds . When we compared the expression of genes associated with the efferocytosis pathway between non-diabetic and diabetic foot ulcers , we found a striking increase in overall expression of efferocytosis pathway genes in diabetic wounds compared to non-diabetic wounds ( Figure 3A ) . In particular , the expression of AXL increased in all cell types in diabetic wounds , while expression of its ligand GAS6 increased in all cell types with the exception of basal keratinocytes and mast cells . To further investigate the AXL/GAS6 signaling pathway , we analyzed these data with CellChat , which quantitatively infers intercellular signaling networks from scRNA-seq data ( Jin et al . , 2021 ) . This analysis revealed altered signaling between AXL and its ligand GAS6 between the two groups . In non-diabetic patient wounds , GAS6 expression by several cell types , including monocytes/macrophages and fibroblasts , stimulated signaling via AXL receptors on fibroblasts and pericytes . However , in diabetic patient wounds , GAS6 and AXL expression was more robust in several cell types . Notably , monocytes/macrophages increased GAS6 stimulation and newly expressed AXL to receive pathway signaling in diabetic wounds ( Figure 3B ) . To validate these findings , we stained sections of non-diabetic foot wounds and diabetic foot ulcers with Abs against Gas6 and CD68 , a macrophage marker . Indeed , we found that Gas6 staining was more prevalent in diabetic skin sections , and that it colocalized with the macrophage marker ( Figure 3C ) . Further , when quantified via corrected total fluorescence ( CTF ) , more Gas6 staining was observed in diabetic samples , though this was not significant . This supported the CellChat results , indicating that macrophages express Gas6 more highly in diabetic wounds . Taken together , these data indicate that diabetic wounds may activate and modulate GAS6-AXL signaling , and suggest a potential avenue for future research . Next , we sought to examine the molecular mechanisms that induce Axl mRNA expression after injury . Prior work showed that Axl expression was induced by toll-like receptor 3 ( TLR3 ) stimulation ( Rothlin et al . , 2007 ) and that TLR3 is essential for skin wound repair ( Lin et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , we experimentally tested the role of TLR3 signaling in Axl expression in the skin . scRNA-seq of early wounds revealed that TLR mRNAs are highly expressed in neutrophils and macrophages with a few expressed in dendritic cells and fibroblasts ( Figure 4A ) . Interestingly , TLR3 is unique among the TLRs in that it is expressed by both dendritic cells and fibroblasts , which also express high levels of Axl in the single-cell dataset ( Figure 2A ) . To determine if TLR3 stimulation upregulates Axl expression in the skin , we injected the synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid ( poly ( I:C ) ) or a PBS control in naive mouse back skin of either wild-type ( WT ) or TLR3 knockout ( KO ) mice . We collected the injection site and surrounding area after 2 hr and processed the skin samples for qPCR and immunostaining ( Figure 4B ) . We first analyzed cytokine mRNA expression , a target of TLR3 signaling that promotes inflammation ( Rothlin et al . , 2007 ) . While several inflammatory cytokines were not induced in skin injected with poly ( I:C ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) , interferon ( IFN ) -β ( Ifnb ) was upregulated in WT mice injected with poly ( I:C ) but not in the skin of TLR3 KO mice ( Figure 4C ) , confirming the specificity of poly ( I:C ) for activation of TLR3 in the skin ( Alexopoulou et al . , 2001 ) . Axl protein ( Figure 4D ) and mRNA ( Figure 4E ) were induced in naive skin upon poly ( I:C ) injection , and Axl mRNA induction and protein expression were abrogated in skin of TLR3 KO mice ( Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . Axl protein expression around the dermal injection site was quantified via CTF ( Figure 4F ) , confirming these results . Taken together , these data indicate that TLR3 signaling is sufficient to activate Axl expression in naive skin . Since Ifnb was elevated by TLR3 signaling in naive skin , we determined whether injecting recombinant IFN-β intradermally into naive mouse back skin was sufficient to induce Axl protein expression ( Figure 4G ) . Two hours after injection , Axl protein was detected by immunostaining in skin injected with IFN-β but not control skin ( Figure 4H and F ) . Next , to determine if TLR3 activation was necessary for Axl expression in skin wounds , we analyzed Axl expression in wound beds of TLR3 KO mice . In contrast to our previous results in naive skin , Axl protein expression was stimulated in TLR3 KO wound beds similar to WT mice ( Figure 4I ) . Thus , these data suggest that while TLR3 is sufficient to drive Axl expression in naive skin , additional mechanisms drive Axl upregulation within skin wounds in its absence . Based on our data showing upregulation of Axl mRNA and protein expression in wound beds , even in the absence of TLR3 , we hypothesized that Axl may play a role in wound healing . To examine whether Axl signaling was required for wound repair , we intraperitoneally injected mice 3 hr prior to injury with either a control IgG Ab or anti-Axl function blocking Ab , which binds to Axl’s extracellular domain and blocks Axl-mediated viral infection ( Retallack et al . , 2016 ) , and has been shown to inhibit Axl activity in vitro ( Bauer et al . , 2012; Figure 5A ) . Since Axl activity upregulates Axl mRNA expression in a positive feedback loop ( Brand et al . , 2014 ) , we analyzed Axl mRNA expression in wounds of Ab-treated mice . While we saw a nonsignificant downregulation of Axl mRNA at 1 day ( D ) post injury , Axl mRNA was significantly downregulated in skin wounds treated with anti-Axl Ab on day 5 compared to control IgG Ab injected wounds ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that the anti-Axl Ab treatment reduced Axl signaling in skin wounds . Next , we examined the effect of Axl inhibition on apoptotic cell clearance in skin wounds . TUNEL+ cells were present but rare in both anti-Axl Ab and IgG Ab-treated 1-day wounds ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . Additional staining in sections from wounds 3 and 5 days after injury also showed no significant difference in cleaved ( active ) caspase 3+ cells in anti-Axl Ab and IgG Ab-treated wounds ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . Further , we detected no significant changes to gene expression of selected members of the efferocytosis signaling pathway or common inflammatory cytokines 1 day after injury , indicating no major inflammatory defects ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . Thus , additional efferocytosis mechanisms , potentially including other members of the TAM family , likely clear apoptotic cells in early skin wounds despite Axl inhibition . To characterize the impact of Axl inhibition on inflammation at 3 days after injury , we used flow cytometry to quantify the immune cells present in the wound bed ( Figure 5C–D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ) . Interestingly , no significant change was observed in the proportion of dendritic cells , neutrophils , or macrophages that were present in IgG or anti-Axl Ab-treated wound beds . However , the proportion of cell types expressing Axl was altered , with more Axl+ macrophages and fewer Axl+ DCs present in the anti-Axl Ab-treated group compared to the IgG Ab control . Despite the relatively normal inflammatory cell numbers at day 3 after injury , wounds treated with anti-Axl Ab exhibited observable healing defects at 5 days post injury compared to wounds treated with control IgG Ab , including a qualitative lack of granulation tissue visible with hematoxylin and eosin ( H&E ) staining ( Figure 5E ) . We also observed that upon Axl inhibition , fibroblast repopulation was significantly reduced ( Figure 5E–F ) . Revascularization was also defective; Axl inhibition significantly reduced the CD31+ area of wound beds ( Figure 5E–F ) . However , we observed no significant difference in the percentage of wound closure by keratinocytes as indicated by ITGA6 staining between the two treatments ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1E ) . We observed significant changes in gene expression at 5 days after injury in wounds lacking Axl activity , including a significant downregulation of Arg1 , Tgfb , and Il1a , and significant upregulation of Ifnb , Socs1 , and Socs3 upon Axl inhibition ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . Taken together , these changes suggest that Axl inhibition impairs proper healing , resulting in significant defects to revascularization and fibroblast repopulation . To further examine the role of efferocytosis receptors in skin wound repair , we abrogated the function of a member of the TIM family of receptors , Timd4 . Intraperitoneal injection of a function blocking anti-Timd4 Ab effectively blocks efferocytosis in an atherosclerosis mouse model ( Foks et al . , 2016 ) . Strikingly , we found that wounds of mice treated with anti-Timd4 Ab displayed significantly more TUNEL+ apoptotic cells in 1- and 5-day wound beds compared to wounds of IgG Ab-treated mice ( Figure 6A–B ) . Similarly , we observed an increase in cleaved caspase 3+ cells in wounds of anti-Timd4 Ab-treated mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) . While this does not preclude the possibility of an increase in apoptosis upon Ab treatment , it is consistent with a defect to efferocytosis . Inhibition of Timd4 resulted in qualitative defects in granulation tissue in H&E-stained sections of 5-day wounds ( Figure 6C ) . Immunostaining of wound sections with Abs against aSMA ( Figure 6D and F ) and ITGA6 ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C ) did not indicate significant changes to either fibroblast repopulation or re-epithelialization , respectively . However , staining for CD31 ( Figure 6E–F ) revealed a significant defect to revascularization in wounds of anti-Timd4 Ab mice compared to wounds of IgG Ab-treated mice , which indicates a defect to proper healing in the proliferative phase of wound repair . Next , we examined mRNA expression profiles of inflammatory and efferocytosis signaling pathways in IgG Ab and anti-Timd4 Ab-treated wound beds ( Figure 6G ) . The inflammatory cytokines Ifng and Ifnb were significantly upregulated at day 1 or 3 , respectively , in Timd4-inhibited wounds compared to control wounds , suggesting altered inflammatory signaling . Interestingly , at day 1 and/or day 3 , Socs1 and Socs3 were also significantly upregulated , similar to the gene expression pattern observed after Axl inhibition ( Figure 5I ) . Taken together , these results indicate that Timd4 activity is required for reducing apoptotic cells , inflammation gene expression , and revascularization after injury . \n Here , we provide an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level . We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients . Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds , our data show that efferocytosis receptors , Axl and Timd4 , have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair . We found that apoptotic genes were upregulated in most of the cell types present in early wounds , which likely allows the dynamic shifts in transcriptional profiles of inflammatory cells we observed in the first few days of tissue repair . Apoptotic cells are required for tail regeneration of Xenopus laevis ( Tseng et al . , 2007 ) and tissue regeneration of planaria ( Hwang et al . , 2004 ) and have been widely implicated in early wound repair ( Greenhalgh , 1998; Arya et al . , 2014 ) . Mechanistically , apoptotic cells can release signaling factors including Wnts and PGE2 to promote proliferation of tissue resident cells and tissue repair in multiple species ( Codispoti et al . , 2019; Li et al . , 2010; Fuchs et al . , 2013 ) . Detection of apoptotic cells has also been linked to inflammation and context-dependent integration of IL-4 signaling to activate an anti-inflammatory and tissue repair gene program ( Bosurgi et al . , 2017a ) . Exposure of PtdSer on the outer leaflet of apoptotic cell membranes acts as a sensor for engulfment in evolutionarily conserved mechanisms ( Rothlin and Ghosh , 2020 ) . Our data suggest that in skin wounds , apoptotic cells are rapidly detected and removed via efferocytosis , which is consistent with the large number of phagocytic neutrophils and macrophages in early wounds . We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds , and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds . Interestingly , efferocytosis receptors were upregulated in professional phagocytes as well as in fibroblasts , which also increased expression of a large number of efferocytosis ligands in both mouse wounds and diabetic foot ulcers ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility , migration , and ECM production ( Romana-Souza et al . , 2021 ) , and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells . Growing evidence suggests that distinct efferocytosis receptors elicit cell- and tissue-specific responses . Axl and Mer exhibit differential ligand specificity and shedding upon activation ( Zagórska et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , Axl null bone marrow-derived macrophages are unable to perform efferocytosis with TLR3 activation in vitro , which suggests that Axl plays a central role in efferocytosis in inflammatory environments ( Bosurgi et al . , 2017b ) . Here , we show that in early murine skin wounds , Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner , but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages , suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors . Furthermore , we did not detect differences in Axl expression in TLR3 null and control wounds , further suggesting the inflammatory wound environment in vivo displays activation of Axl receptor expression independent of TLR3 . Axl may function in skin wounds by interacting with other tyrosine kinase receptors , which has been shown for EGFR , MET , and PDGFR ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , Axl/Gas6 signaling can also regulate tumorigenesis to support tumor cell survival ( Linger et al . , 2008 ) , migration ( Wilson et al . , 2014 ) , and angiogenesis ( Li et al . , 2009; Zhu et al . , 2019 ) . Future work exploring Axl’s function in a cell type-dependent manner , including possibly directly activating angiogenesis in skin wounds , will decipher these possibilities . Our data also implicate an important role for resident macrophages in regulating early wound repair mechanisms . In particular , we identified the expression of several efferocytosis receptors and ligands on Lyve1+ resident macrophages including Timd4 . Timd4 is expressed on tissue resident macrophages in multiple tissues including in the peritoneal and resident cardiac macrophages . In the heart , Lyve1+ resident macrophages act in a cardioprotective manner during myocardial infarction ( Dick et al . , 2019 ) and are immunoregulatory and promote engraftment of cardiac allografts ( Thornley et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , similar to our data , Timd4 promotes efferocytosis in the heart . During cardiac infarction , Timd4 is also required for T cell responses and support of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) ( Foks et al . , 2016 ) . In the skin , Timd4 is essential for allograft survival ( Yeung et al . , 2013 ) , which has been proposed to act through DCs to support Tregs . Indeed , Timd4 is expressed in DCs in later stages of wound repair ( Haensel et al . , 2020 ) . Our future studies will test the role of Timd4 on DCs and resident macrophages , T cell immunity , and how they impact wound repair phenotypes noted with Timd4 inhibition . In summary , our data implicate apoptosis recognition receptors as an important regulator of skin wound healing . We find that early murine wound beds and human diabetic foot wounds significantly upregulate apoptotic genes and receptors that recognize apoptotic cells and that inhibition of multiple apoptotic receptors impairs wound repair . Given the importance of apoptosis in wound repair and the expression of distinct apoptotic receptors in different cells , skin wound healing is an excellent model to decipher the mechanisms by which distinct cells recognize and respond to interactions with apoptotic cells . Given further research into the healing phenotypes of efferocytosis-inhibited wounds , it may be that targeting these mechanisms may reveal therapeutic avenues that promote healing in chronic , non-healing wounds , particularly in diabetic patients . \n WT C57BL/6J mice ( Strain #:000664 ) , B6;129S1-Tlr3tm1Flv/J ( TLR3 KO ) mice ( Strain #:005217 ) , Lyz2tm1 ( cre/ERT2 ) Grtn/J ( Lyz2CreER ) mice ( Strain #:031674 ) , and B6 . 129 ( Cg ) -Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sortm4 ( ACTB-tdTomato , -EGFP ) Luo/J ( mTmG ) mice ( Strain #:007676 ) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories . PdgfraCreER mice were developed in the laboratory of B . Hogan ( Duke University , Durham , NC , USA ) . Mice were maintained through routine breeding in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care ( AALAC ) -accredited animal facility at Yale University ( Protocol # 11248 ) . Animals were maintained on a standard chow diet ad libitum ( Harlan Laboratories , 2018S ) in 12 hr light/dark cycling . Up to five injured mice were housed per cage . All experimental procedures were approved and in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . For experiments using intraperitoneal ( i . p . ) tamoxifen administration , 100 μL of 30 mg/mL tamoxifen ( Sigma-Aldrich ) in sesame oil was injected daily for 3 days prior to experiments . Diabetic and non-diabetic adults with chronic foot ulcers that were undergoing skin wound debridement were consented to donate discarded tissue for this study ( IRB approval # 1609018360 ) . The diabetic foot ulcer specimens for scRNA-seq were obtained from five individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes . The non-diabetic foot wound specimens for scRNA-seq were obtained from four individuals , two of whom provided multiple samples . The diabetic foot ulcer specimens for immunofluorescence staining were obtained from five individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and one individual diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes . The non-diabetic foot wound specimens for immunofluorescence staining were obtained from two individuals . Demographic information listed in Supplementary file 1 . Seven- to 9-week-old male mice were wounded during the telogen phase of hair cycling . Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and six full-thickness wounds , at least 4 mm apart , were made on shaved back skin using a 4 mm biopsy punch ( Millitex ) . Animals were sacrificed at noted intervals after injury and wound beds were processed for subsequent analysis . Wound beds were digested for scRNA-seq analysis in a buffer of Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) medium with glutamine ( Gibco ) , Liberase Thermolysin Medium ( TM ) ( Roche ) , DNase , N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethane sulfonic acid ( Gibco ) , sodium pyruvate ( Gibco ) , non-essential amino acids ( Gibco ) , and antibiotic-antimycotic ( 100X ) ( Gibco ) . Blood cells were removed with ammonium-chloride-potassium ( ACK ) lysing buffer ( Gibco ) . Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) ( ATCC ) with 0 . 1% bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) for analysis . Skin wound specimens were collected at the clinical setting in PBS with antibiotic-antimycotic ( 100X ) ( Gibco ) , and transported to the lab on ice for processing . All specimens were processed within 3 hr of collection . The specimen was cleaned by immersion with 10% betadine , 70% ethanol , and PBS . Excess blood and subcutaneous fat were removed , and skin was mechanically minced before being digested in an enzyme cocktail consisting of dispase ( Stemcell Technologies ) , collagenase I ( Worthington ) , and collagenase II ( Worthington ) in 0 . 25% trypsin-EDTA ( Gibco ) . Blood cells were removed with ACK lysing buffer ( Gibco ) . Cells were resuspended in DMEM ( ATCC ) with 0 . 1% BSA for analysis . Human tissue sections were kept for at least 24 hr in 10% neutral buffered formalin and dehydrated in alcohol diluted in 0 . 9% NaCl/dH2O; the sequence being 30% EtOH , 50% EtOH , 70%EtOH . Specimens remained in 70% EtOH overnight . The following day , sections were dehydrated further in 85% , 95% , and 100% ethanol diluted in distilled water before being preserved in 50% EtOH/ 50% xylene and then 100% xylene . Tissue sections were allowed to soak in paraffin for at least 1 hr and then embedded in disposable molds with melted paraffin wax . Five µm tissue sections were obtained and adhered to charged slides for histological analysis . scRNA-seq data from 24 hr and 48 hr mouse wound beds were processed using the standard cellranger pipeline ( 10X Genomics ) . Downstream analysis was performed using the Scanpy package in Python ( Wolf et al . , 2018 ) . Cells were filtered for quality control to avoid doublets and dead cells . Dimensionality reduction and downstream data visualization were completed using the Scanpy implementation of UMAP ( McInnes et al . , 2020 ) and the ShinyCell package in R ( Ouyang et al . , 2021 ) , respectively . Data is presented as scaled log-normalized mRNA counts ( i . e . , expression ) . We adapted the cell-type annotation pipeline from Kumar et al . , 2018 , to label our sequencing data by broad cell type , as was done in Wasko et al . , 2022 . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) across timepoints were calculated using the rank_genes_groups function from the Scanpy module in Python with default parameters . We then performed enrichment analysis on the top ( logfoldchanges >1 . 5 ) DEGs for each group using g:Profiler ( Raudvere et al . , 2019 ) , with the GO knowledgebase as the reference database . Cells were collected from WT bone marrow as previously described ( Rios et al . , 2017 ) . Neutrophils were isolated using MACS Ly6G beads ( Miltenyi Biotech 130-120-337 ) . Neutrophils were stained with CFSE cell labeling kit ( Abcam ab113853 ) for 15 min . Stained neutrophils were incubated overnight in RPMI medium to induce apoptosis . 10 , 000 neutrophils in 50 µL PBS or 50 µL PBS control were injected under the scab and into the wound bed of 1- , 3- , or 5-day wounded mice . Injected mice were sacrificed after 1 hr . Human scRNA-seq data from human samples were generated from 10X Genomics 3’-end single-cell gene expression V2 . Analysis was performed in Scanpy ( Wolf et al . , 2018 ) . Cells were filtered for doublets and dead cells for downstream analysis . Batch correction was performed to integrate cells across samples using Scanorama ( Hie et al . , 2019 ) . Gene expression was scaled , log-transformed , and normalized . Dimensionality reduction was done using PCA and UMAP in Scanpy ( McInnes et al . , 2020 ) . DEGs were calculated using Wilcoxon rank_genes_groups function from Scanpy . Cell-cell communication analysis and data visualization of circos plot were performed using CellChat ( Jin et al . , 2021 ) . CellChat is superior to similar methods because its algorithm accounts for the roles of both signaling cofactors and protein-protein signaling in its predictions of ligand-receptor interaction ( Bridges and Miller-Jensen , 2022 ) . CellChat is available as an open-source software package in R . Mouse skin and wound beds were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound ( VWR ) and wound beds were sectioned through their entirety to identify the center . 7 µm or 14 µm cryosections were processed as previously described ( Shook et al . , 2016 ) and stained with Abs listed below or H&E . Human tissue slides were warmed in the oven at 60°C for an hour before being deparaffinized and rehydrated in ethanol diluted in water . Antigen retrieval was performed at 80°C for an hour and after slides had cooled , nonspecific blocking was performed , the primary Ab was added , and the slides rested overnight at 4°C . The next day , slides were warmed to room temperature , washed , and the secondary Ab was allowed to penetrate for 1 hr at room temperature . Prolong Gold plus DAPI was added to each tissue section and cover slides were added . Slides rested at 4°C for at least 1 day before imaging . Composite images were acquired using the tiles module on a Zeiss AxioImager M1 ( Zeiss ) equipped with an Orca camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Whole wound bed samples were digested using TRIzol LS ( Invitrogen ) . RNA was extracted from the aqueous phase using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) . cDNA was generated using equal amounts of total RNA with the Superscript III First Strand Synthesis Kit ( Invitrogen ) per manufacturer’s instructions . All quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SYBR green on a LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) . Primers for specific genes are listed below . Results were normalized to β-actin as previously described . Seven- to 9-week-old male mice were injected intradermally with 10 µL PBS , 50 µg/mL Poly ( I:C ) ( Invivogen ) , or 5 µg/mL IFNB ( R&D ) with 0 . 5% BSA . The injection site was isolated using a 6 mm biopsy punch 2 hr after injection and processed for staining . To inhibit signaling pathways in vivo , 7- to 9-week-old male mice were injected intraperitoneally with 25 µg/100 µL anti-Axl Ab ( R&D ) , 200 µg/100 µL anti-Timd4 ( BioXCell ) , or equivalent unit IgG control ( R&D ) in PBS 3 hr before wounding . Mouse wound beds were dissected and digested into single cells using Liberase TM ( Roche ) and cells were suspended in fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting ( FACS ) staining buffer ( 0 . 05% BSA in DMEM ) . Digested tissue was filtered with a 70 μm and 40 μm cell strainer prior to centrifugation . Cell suspensions were stained with Abs for 30 min on ice . Dendritic cells were defined as CD11b+ Cd11c+ cells; macrophages were defined as CD11b+ CD11c- CD64+ Ly6G- cells; neutrophils were defined as CD11b+ CD11c- CD64- Ly6G+ cells . To exclude dead cells , Sytox Blue ( Invitrogen , 1:1000 ) was added immediately before analysis or sorting using a FACS Aria III with FACS DiVA software ( BD Biosciences ) . Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FlowJo Software ( FlowJo ) . Histological quantification for each wound bed was conducted on multiple central sections for each wound bed when available . The percentage of the wound bed covered by ITGA6 staining ( re-epithelialization ) and CTF for Axl ( in a 1 mm square around the injection site ) or aSMA ( in the wound bed ) were calculated using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) as described previously ( Schmidt and Horsley , 2013; Shook et al . , 2018 ) . Revascularization ( CD31+ ) was calculated using Adobe Photoshop to measure the total pixels positive for Ab staining divided by the total number of pixels in wound beds . Cell death was quantified using the RETINA Analysis Toolkit in FIJI ( https://imagej . net/plugins/retina-analysis-toolkit ) . To determine significance between two groups , comparisons were made using Student’s t-test . Analyses across multiple groups were made using a one- or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc using GraphPad Prism for Mac ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) with significance set at p<0 . 05 . Sample sizes were determined using power analysis and taking into consideration our experience with the wounding model .

         "Here , we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds . We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells , including resident Lyve1+ macrophages , during inflammation . Interestingly , human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6 . During early inflammation in mouse wounds , we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms . Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis . By contrast , inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor , Timd4 , in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair . These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients . Proper initiation and subsequent resolution of inflammation is essential for tissue repair and progression to the proliferation stage of healing , when fibroblasts , blood vessels , and other tissue-specific cells proliferate and migrate , forming new tissue to repair the wound . While several signaling factors have been shown to induce apoptosis in wounds  , the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and regulate tissue repair are not well understood . Apoptosis occurs after skin injury , and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells – or efferocytosis – by macrophages reduces inflammatory signaling and repair in several tissues  . To understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which apoptosis regulates skin wound healing , we performed single-cell RNA sequencing  on cells from murine wound beds 24 hr and 48 hr after injury . In addition , inhibition of two efferocytosis receptors , Axl and Timd4 , abrogates proper wound repair . The results provide an atlas of cellular dynamics during the early stages of wound healing and reveal the essential role of the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells in driving tissue repair after injury . To assess cellular and molecular heterogeneity of the wound bed during the inflammatory phase , we performed scRNA-seq on cells isolated from 4 mm full-thickness biopsy punches on mouse back skin at 24 hr and 48 hr after injury  . To ensure that we also captured the immediately adjacent tissue as well as cells that may have migrated into the wound site , we used a 6 mm biopsy punch to collect the tissue before isolating cells using enzymatic digestion  . By training a neural network to identify cell types based on expression of established marker genes  , we classified four major cell types in the scRNA-seq data , including monocytes/macrophages  , neutrophils  , dendritic cells  , and fibroblasts  at both timepoints  . To explore the changes in the major cell types in early wound beds  , we analyzed the genes that were significantly upregulated in each group relative to the mRNAs expressed by the full dataset to determine gene ontology  terms that were enriched for each cell type  . Since apoptosis also involves post-transcriptional activation of several proteins , we sought to confirm that apoptosis occurred during early skin wound inflammation in vivo . We also detected cleaved caspase 3 in CD11c+ dendritic cells  and Pdgfra+ fibroblasts  in 24 hr wound beds . Given the upregulation of mRNAs associated with apoptosis and the relatively low level of apoptotic cells in early wound beds , we hypothesized that efficient efferocytosis clears apoptotic cells during inflammation . Initially , we inspected mRNA levels of efferocytosis receptors , their ligands , and downstream factors in scRNA-seq data from 24 hr and 48 hr wounds  . Examining the UMAP plot to determine the heterogeneity of efferocytosis gene expression within individual cell types , we observed that Gas6 was highly expressed by a specific subset of monocyte/macrophage cells . These cells also overexpressed the resident macrophage marker Lyve1 , the apoptosis receptor Timd4 , and Retnla , a downstream factor of efferocytosis  , indicating that they may play a role in apoptosis detection and response in wound healing . Lyve1 has been identified as a marker for resident macrophages , which are distinct from the majority of wound macrophages that differentiate from bone marrow-derived monocytes and are recruited to the wound after injury  . To confirm the presence of Lyve1+ resident cells in vivo , we used a Lyz2CreER;mTmG mouse model , in which myeloid cells in the bone marrow can be induced to express GFP prior to injury , such that any GFP+ cells observed in the wound bed are interpreted as newly recruited to the site of injury , while GFP- cells are interpreted to be resident to the skin . We observed that Lyve1 was expressed at the protein level both in wound beds  and adjacent to the wound  with immunofluorescence staining , and confirmed that these cells were resident rather than recruited to the wound bed after injury , since they did not express GFP . Further , we confirmed that Lyve1+ cells co-expressed Gas6 protein  and that Timd4 protein  was expressed in wound beds . The TAM receptor Axl was uniquely expressed in the single-cell dataset by both dendritic cells and fibroblasts  . Using immunofluorescence staining , we confirmed Axl expression in 24 hr wound beds in both dendritic cells   and fibroblasts   , which displayed elongated GFP+ processes with central localization of Axl . Thus , while we cannot rule out Axl expression by other cell types in skin wounds , these data are consistent with our single-cell results , confirming that Axl is expressed by fibroblasts and dendritic cells during the inflammatory response of skin repair . We also analyzed mRNA expression of apoptosis-related genes by qPCR to determine their expression in wound beds compared to naive skin  . All efferocytosis receptor mRNAs studied , including the TAM receptors , were significantly upregulated in the wound bed compared to naive skin , while the ligand Gas6 was significantly downregulated . The downstream factor of efferocytosis Retnla was also significantly downregulated in the wound bed , while Socs1 and Socs3 were significantly upregulated . To analyze efferocytosis activity after injury , we intradermally injected labeled apoptotic neutrophils from bone marrow into wound beds 1 , 3 , and 5 days after injury . While wounds at 5 days had significantly more cells undergoing efferocytosis  , the efferocytosis rate was generally constant , with a slight but nonsignificant increase at 3 days  . Taken together , these data indicate that the machinery for multiple efferocytosis pathways are active in the inflammatory and proliferative stages of wound healing . We next set out to explore whether these apoptosis and efferocytosis-related pathways were also relevant in pathological states associated with dysregulated wound healing , such as diabetes . Previous studies have indicated that apoptosis is increased in diabetic wounds , including an elevation in apoptotic lymphocytes  . Additional studies have shown that hypoxic environments  increase macrophage efferocytosis  , though other studies have indicated that macrophage efferocytosis is defective in diabetic wounds  . To analyze the expression of transcriptional changes in apoptosis and efferocytosis signaling in foot wounds , we analyzed genes in these categories in four non-diabetic and five diabetic human patients  . Specifically , monocytes/macrophages increased expression of several apoptosis genes  in diabetic foot ulcers compared to monocytes/macrophages in non-diabetic wounds . When we compared the expression of genes associated with the efferocytosis pathway between non-diabetic and diabetic foot ulcers , we found a striking increase in overall expression of efferocytosis pathway genes in diabetic wounds compared to non-diabetic wounds  . In particular , the expression of AXL increased in all cell types in diabetic wounds , while expression of its ligand GAS6 increased in all cell types with the exception of basal keratinocytes and mast cells . In non-diabetic patient wounds , GAS6 expression by several cell types , including monocytes/macrophages and fibroblasts , stimulated signaling via AXL receptors on fibroblasts and pericytes . However , in diabetic patient wounds , GAS6 and AXL expression was more robust in several cell types . Notably , monocytes/macrophages increased GAS6 stimulation and newly expressed AXL to receive pathway signaling in diabetic wounds  . To validate these findings , we stained sections of non-diabetic foot wounds and diabetic foot ulcers with Abs against Gas6 and CD68 , a macrophage marker . Taken together , these data indicate that diabetic wounds may activate and modulate GAS6-AXL signaling , and suggest a potential avenue for future research . Prior work showed that Axl expression was induced by toll-like receptor 3  stimulation  and that TLR3 is essential for skin wound repair  . scRNA-seq of early wounds revealed that TLR mRNAs are highly expressed in neutrophils and macrophages with a few expressed in dendritic cells and fibroblasts  . Interestingly , TLR3 is unique among the TLRs in that it is expressed by both dendritic cells and fibroblasts , which also express high levels of Axl in the single-cell dataset  . To determine if TLR3 stimulation upregulates Axl expression in the skin , we injected the synthetic double-stranded RNA polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid ( poly  ) or a PBS control in naive mouse back skin of either wild-type  or TLR3 knockout  mice . While several inflammatory cytokines were not induced in skin injected with poly   , interferon  -β  was upregulated in WT mice injected with poly  but not in the skin of TLR3 KO mice  , confirming the specificity of poly  for activation of TLR3 in the skin  . Axl protein  and mRNA  were induced in naive skin upon poly  injection , and Axl mRNA induction and protein expression were abrogated in skin of TLR3 KO mice  . Since Ifnb was elevated by TLR3 signaling in naive skin , we determined whether injecting recombinant IFN-β intradermally into naive mouse back skin was sufficient to induce Axl protein expression  . Next , to determine if TLR3 activation was necessary for Axl expression in skin wounds , we analyzed Axl expression in wound beds of TLR3 KO mice . In contrast to our previous results in naive skin , Axl protein expression was stimulated in TLR3 KO wound beds similar to WT mice  . Thus , these data suggest that while TLR3 is sufficient to drive Axl expression in naive skin , additional mechanisms drive Axl upregulation within skin wounds in its absence . Based on our data showing upregulation of Axl mRNA and protein expression in wound beds , even in the absence of TLR3 , we hypothesized that Axl may play a role in wound healing . To examine whether Axl signaling was required for wound repair , we intraperitoneally injected mice 3 hr prior to injury with either a control IgG Ab or anti-Axl function blocking Ab , which binds to Axl’s extracellular domain and blocks Axl-mediated viral infection  , and has been shown to inhibit Axl activity in vitro  . Since Axl activity upregulates Axl mRNA expression in a positive feedback loop  , we analyzed Axl mRNA expression in wounds of Ab-treated mice . While we saw a nonsignificant downregulation of Axl mRNA at 1 day  post injury , Axl mRNA was significantly downregulated in skin wounds treated with anti-Axl Ab on day 5 compared to control IgG Ab injected wounds  , indicating that the anti-Axl Ab treatment reduced Axl signaling in skin wounds . Next , we examined the effect of Axl inhibition on apoptotic cell clearance in skin wounds . TUNEL+ cells were present but rare in both anti-Axl Ab and IgG Ab-treated 1-day wounds  . Additional staining in sections from wounds 3 and 5 days after injury also showed no significant difference in cleaved  caspase 3+ cells in anti-Axl Ab and IgG Ab-treated wounds  . Thus , additional efferocytosis mechanisms , potentially including other members of the TAM family , likely clear apoptotic cells in early skin wounds despite Axl inhibition . To characterize the impact of Axl inhibition on inflammation at 3 days after injury , we used flow cytometry to quantify the immune cells present in the wound bed  . Interestingly , no significant change was observed in the proportion of dendritic cells , neutrophils , or macrophages that were present in IgG or anti-Axl Ab-treated wound beds . However , the proportion of cell types expressing Axl was altered , with more Axl+ macrophages and fewer Axl+ DCs present in the anti-Axl Ab-treated group compared to the IgG Ab control . Despite the relatively normal inflammatory cell numbers at day 3 after injury , wounds treated with anti-Axl Ab exhibited observable healing defects at 5 days post injury compared to wounds treated with control IgG Ab , including a qualitative lack of granulation tissue visible with hematoxylin and eosin  staining  . Revascularization was also defective; Axl inhibition significantly reduced the CD31+ area of wound beds  . We observed significant changes in gene expression at 5 days after injury in wounds lacking Axl activity , including a significant downregulation of Arg1 , Tgfb , and Il1a , and significant upregulation of Ifnb , Socs1 , and Socs3 upon Axl inhibition  . To further examine the role of efferocytosis receptors in skin wound repair , we abrogated the function of a member of the TIM family of receptors , Timd4 . Strikingly , we found that wounds of mice treated with anti-Timd4 Ab displayed significantly more TUNEL+ apoptotic cells in 1- and 5-day wound beds compared to wounds of IgG Ab-treated mice  . Similarly , we observed an increase in cleaved caspase 3+ cells in wounds of anti-Timd4 Ab-treated mice  . However , staining for CD31  revealed a significant defect to revascularization in wounds of anti-Timd4 Ab mice compared to wounds of IgG Ab-treated mice , which indicates a defect to proper healing in the proliferative phase of wound repair . Next , we examined mRNA expression profiles of inflammatory and efferocytosis signaling pathways in IgG Ab and anti-Timd4 Ab-treated wound beds  . The inflammatory cytokines Ifng and Ifnb were significantly upregulated at day 1 or 3 , respectively , in Timd4-inhibited wounds compared to control wounds , suggesting altered inflammatory signaling . We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients . Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds , our data show that efferocytosis receptors , Axl and Timd4 , have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair . We found that apoptotic genes were upregulated in most of the cell types present in early wounds , which likely allows the dynamic shifts in transcriptional profiles of inflammatory cells we observed in the first few days of tissue repair . Apoptotic cells are required for tail regeneration of Xenopus laevis  and tissue regeneration of planaria  and have been widely implicated in early wound repair  . Our data suggest that in skin wounds , apoptotic cells are rapidly detected and removed via efferocytosis , which is consistent with the large number of phagocytic neutrophils and macrophages in early wounds . We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds , and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds . Interestingly , efferocytosis receptors were upregulated in professional phagocytes as well as in fibroblasts , which also increased expression of a large number of efferocytosis ligands in both mouse wounds and diabetic foot ulcers  . These data resonate with recent data suggesting that fibroblasts can engulf apoptotic endothelial cells to alter their contractility , migration , and ECM production  , and may indicate a direct role for fibroblasts in modulating the inflammatory milieu of early wounds through detection of apoptotic cells . Furthermore , Axl null bone marrow-derived macrophages are unable to perform efferocytosis with TLR3 activation in vitro , which suggests that Axl plays a central role in efferocytosis in inflammatory environments  . Here , we show that in early murine skin wounds , Axl inhibition did not impact efferocytosis in a detectable manner , but rather Axl expression shifted from dendritic cells to macrophages , suggesting possible compensatory mechanisms via other efferocytosis receptors . Furthermore , we did not detect differences in Axl expression in TLR3 null and control wounds , further suggesting the inflammatory wound environment in vivo displays activation of Axl receptor expression independent of TLR3 . Axl may function in skin wounds by interacting with other tyrosine kinase receptors , which has been shown for EGFR , MET , and PDGFR  . Future work exploring Axl’s function in a cell type-dependent manner , including possibly directly activating angiogenesis in skin wounds , will decipher these possibilities . Our future studies will test the role of Timd4 on DCs and resident macrophages , T cell immunity , and how they impact wound repair phenotypes noted with Timd4 inhibition . In summary , our data implicate apoptosis recognition receptors as an important regulator of skin wound healing . We find that early murine wound beds and human diabetic foot wounds significantly upregulate apoptotic genes and receptors that recognize apoptotic cells and that inhibition of multiple apoptotic receptors impairs wound repair . Given the importance of apoptosis in wound repair and the expression of distinct apoptotic receptors in different cells , skin wound healing is an excellent model to decipher the mechanisms by which distinct cells recognize and respond to interactions with apoptotic cells . Given further research into the healing phenotypes of efferocytosis-inhibited wounds , it may be that targeting these mechanisms may reveal therapeutic avenues that promote healing in chronic , non-healing wounds , particularly in diabetic patients . Diabetic and non-diabetic adults with chronic foot ulcers that were undergoing skin wound debridement were consented to donate discarded tissue for this study  . 10 , 000 neutrophils in 50 µL PBS or 50 µL PBS control were injected under the scab and into the wound bed of 1- , 3- , or 5-day wounded mice . Mouse skin and wound beds were embedded in optimum cutting temperature compound  and wound beds were sectioned through their entirety to identify the center . To inhibit signaling pathways in vivo , 7- to 9-week-old male mice were injected intraperitoneally with 25 µg/100 µL anti-Axl Ab  , 200 µg/100 µL anti-Timd4  , or equivalent unit IgG control  in PBS 3 hr before wounding . Mouse wound beds were dissected and digested into single cells using Liberase TM  and cells were suspended in fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting  staining buffer  . Dendritic cells were defined as CD11b+ Cd11c+ cells; macrophages were defined as CD11b+ CD11c- CD64+ Ly6G- cells; neutrophils were defined as CD11b+ CD11c- CD64- Ly6G+ cells . Histological quantification for each wound bed was conducted on multiple central sections for each wound bed when available . The percentage of the wound bed covered by ITGA6 staining  and CTF for Axl  or aSMA  were calculated using ImageJ software  as described previously  . "

         "Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues and have enabled the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases . However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . We describe a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations . This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains , TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects , identification of multiplet droplets , and barcoding of experimental timepoints , conditions , and replicates . Furthermore , we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments . \n Spatially and temporally regulated gene expression patterns are a hallmark of multicellular life and function to orchestrate patterning , growth , and differentiation throughout development ( Ingham , 1988; Reeves et al . , 2006 ) . In mature organisms , spatial expression patterns both in tissues and within cells define functionally distinct compartments and determine many aspects of cellular and organismal physiology ( Martin and Ephrussi , 2009 ) . In addition , such expression patterns differentiate healthy and diseased tissue and impact disease etiology ( Marusyk et al . , 2012 ) . Spatial and temporal expression patterns , which can be used to distinguish between cell types and provide insight into cellular function , also provide a means to understand the organization and physiology of complex tissues such as the brain ( Thompson et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , robust and scalable tools for measuring spatial and temporal gene expression patterns at a genome-wide scale and at high resolution would be transformative research tools across many biological disciplines . Single-cell sequencing technologies have provided insights into the dynamics of gene expression throughout development , been used to characterize somatic variation and heterogeneity within tissues , and are currently enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases ( Klein et al . , 2015; Macosko et al . , 2015; Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . The cellular identities of gene expression clusters identified in cell atlas data sets are typically inferred from the expression of distinctive gene sets ( Hung et al . , 2020; Li et al . , 2022; Ma et al . , 2021 ) , and the lack of positive identification of gene expression clusters introduces an element of uncertainty in this analysis . Moreover , this process of manual annotation is labor-intensive and often requires additional experiments to determine or confirm the expression patterns of marker genes . Emerging spatial genomics technologies hold promise in linking anatomical and transcriptomic information ( Lee et al . , 2015; Lein et al . , 2017 ) . Several of the emerging commercial spatial genomics technologies rely on in situ sequencing of marker genes allowing droplet-based single-cell transcriptomic data to be mapped onto a tissue . However , these technologies currently suffer from constraints related to cost , content , or applicability to specific model systems . In addition to descriptive cell atlas projects , studies involving multiple experimental timepoints throughout development and aging , or studies assessing the effects of experimental exposures or genetic manipulations would benefit from increased ability to multiplex samples . Given the fixed costs of droplet-based single-cell sequencing , generating data for single-cell transcriptomic time courses or experimental manipulations can be costly . Outside of descriptive studies , these costs are also a barrier to including replicates to assess biological variability; consequently , a lack of biological replicates derived from independent samples is a common shortcoming of single-cell sequencing experiments . Antibody-based cell hashing or feature barcoding approaches have been developed to allow multiplexing of samples in droplet-based single-cell sequencing reactions ( Stoeckius et al . , 2018; Stoeckius et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , other multiplexing strategies for single-cell sequencing based on alternative methods for tagging cells ( Cheng et al . , 2021 ) or making use of natural genetic variation have been used ( Kurmangaliyev et al . , 2020 ) . While such approaches can reduce per-sample costs , typically samples are barcoded at a population level and thus do not enable labeling of cell subpopulations within a sample . We have developed a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations . This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the poly-adenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . Genetic barcoding approaches have been employed in many unicellular systems , cell culture , and viral transfection to facilitate high-throughput screening using sequencing-based readouts ( Bhang et al . , 2015; Smith et al . , 2009; van Opijnen et al . , 2009 ) . In multicellular animals , techniques such as GESTALT have enabled lineage tracing by using CRISPR to create unique barcodes in differentiating tissue ( McKenna et al . , 2016 ) , and barcode sequencing has also been employed to map connectivity in the brain ( Chen et al . , 2019 ) . Genetically barcoded fly lines can also be used to enable highly multiplexed behavioral assays which can be read out using high-throughput sequencing . Flies carrying TaG-EM barcodes can be exposed to different experimental perturbations and then tested in assays where flies , larvae , or embryos are fractionated based on behavioral outcomes or other phenotypes . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) -based behavioral or other fractionation screens analogous to BAR-Seq or Tn-Seq approaches employed in microbial organisms . \n We cloned a fragment containing a PCR handle sequence and a diverse 14 bp barcode sequence into the SV40 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation sites in the 10xUAS-myr::GFP ( pJFRC12 , Pfeiffer et al . , 2010 ) backbone ( Figure 1A ) . A pool containing 29 unique barcode-containing plasmids was injected into Drosophila embryos for PhiC31-mediated integration into the attP2 landing site ( Groth et al . , 2004 ) and transgenic lines were isolated and confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . We recovered 20 distinctly barcoded Drosophila lines , with some barcodes recovered from multiple crosses ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Such barcoded fly lines have the potential to enable population behavioral measurements , where different exposures , experimental timepoints , and genetic or neural perturbations can be multiplexed and analyzed by measuring barcode abundance in sequencing data ( Figure 1C ) . In addition , the barcodes , which reside on a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct , can be expressed tissue-specifically and read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population and/or an experimental condition of interest ( Figure 1D ) . We conducted initial experiments to optimize amplification of the genetic barcodes using primers targeting the PCR handle inserted just upstream of the 14 bp barcode sequence and PCR primers downstream of the TaG-EM barcode in the SV40 3’ UTR sequence ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To test the accuracy and reproducibility of sequencing-based measurements of TaG-EM barcodes , we constructed structured pools containing defined numbers of flies pooled either evenly with each of the 20 barcode constructs comprising 5% of the pool , or in a staggered manner with sets of barcodes differing in abundance in 2-fold increments ( Figure 2A ) . To examine the impact of technical steps such as DNA extraction and PCR amplification on TaG-EM barcode measurements , even pools were made and extracted in triplicate and amplicon sequencing libraries were made in triplicate for each independently extracted DNA sample for both the even and staggered pools . The resulting data indicated that TaG-EM measurements are highly accurate and reproducible . Technical replicates ( indicated by error bars in Figure 2B–E ) showed minimal variability . Likewise , the three independently extracted replicates of the even pools produced consistent data with all 20 barcodes detected at levels close to the expected 5% abundance ( Figure 2B–C ) . Barcode abundance values for the staggered structured pools was generally consistent with the input values and in most cases , the twofold differences between the different groups of barcodes could be distinguished ( Figure 2D–E ) . The coefficients of variation were largely consistent for groups of TaG-EM barcodes pooled evenly or at different levels within the staggered pools ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . For the staggered pools , abundances correlated well with the expected values , particularly when multiple barcodes for an input level were averaged , in which case R2 values were >0 . 99 ( Figure 2D–E , inset plots ) . This indicates that a high level of quantitative accuracy can be attained using sequencing-based analysis of TaG-EM barcode abundance , particularly when averaging data for three to four independent barcodes for an experimental condition . Next , we tested whether TaG-EM could be used to measure a phototaxis behavior . A mixture of barcoded wild type or blind norpA mutant flies were run together through a phototaxis assay . At the end of a period of light exposure , test tubes facing toward or away from the light were capped , DNA was isolated , and barcodes were amplified and sequenced for each tube . Raw read counts were scaled in proportion to the number of flies per tube and a preference index was calculated for each barcode ( Figure 3A ) . In parallel , individual preference indices were calculated based on manual scoring of videos recorded for each line ( Figure 3B ) . Preference indices calculated for the pooled , NGS-based TaG-EM measurements were nearly identical to conventional behavioral measurements for both wild type and norpA mutants ( Figure 3A–B ) . We next tested whether NGS-based pooled measurements of egg laying could be made . Fertilized females from each of the 20 barcode lines were placed together in egg laying cups , embryos were collected , aged for 12 hr to enable cell numbers to stabilize in the developing eggs , and then DNA was extracted from both the pooled adult flies and the embryos . In general , TaG-EM measurements of oviposition correlated with fly numbers , with the exception of barcode 14 which had reduced barcode abundance across multiple trials ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . This suggests that despite the fact that the genetic barcode constructs are inserted in a common landing site , differences with respect to specific behaviors may exist among the lines , and thus one should test to make sure given lines are appropriate to use in specific behavioral assays . To determine whether TaG-EM could be used to measure age-dependent fecundity , we collected flies from twelve different TaG-EM barcode lines at four time points separated by 1 week ( three barcode lines per timepoint ) . We collected eggs from these fly lines individually and scored the number of viable eggs per female . Next , we pooled the barcoded flies from all timepoints and collected eggs from the pooled flies . These eggs were aged , DNA was extracted , and the TaG-EM barcodes were amplified and sequenced . While measurements from individual barcode lines were noisy , both for manual counts and sequencing based measurements , there was a general trend toward declining fecundity over time ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) , consistent with published reports ( David et al . , 1975 ) . Manually scored viable egg numbers and TaG-EM barcode abundances were well correlated across two independent experimental trials ( R2 values of 0 . 52–0 . 61 for Trial 1 and 0 . 74–0 . 84 for Trial 2 ) . When barcodes from each individual timepoint were averaged , R2 values for the correlation between manual and sequencing-based measurements were 0 . 95 for Trial 1 and 0 . 99 for Trial 2 ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Gut motility defects underlie a number of functional gastrointestinal disorders in humans ( Keller et al . , 2018 ) . To study gut motility in Drosophila , we have developed an assay based on the time it takes a food bolus to transit the larval gut ( Figure 4A ) , similar to approaches that have been employed for studying the role of the microbiome in human gut motility ( Asnicar et al . , 2021 ) . Third instar larvae were starved for 90 min and then fed food containing a blue dye . After 60 min , larvae in which a blue bolus of food was visible were transferred to plates containing non-dyed food , and food transit ( indicated by loss of the blue food bolus ) was scored every 30 min for 5 hr ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Because this assay is highly labor-intensive and requires hands-on effort for the entire 5-hr observation period , there is a limit on how many conditions or replicates can be scored in one session ( ~8 plates maximum ) . Thus , we decided to test whether food transit could be quantified in a more streamlined and scalable fashion by using TaG-EM ( Figure 4B ) . Using the manual assay , we observed that while caffeine-containing food is aversive to larvae , the presence of caffeine reduces transit time through the gut ( Figure 4C , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . This is consistent with previous observations in adult flies that bitter compounds ( including caffeine ) activate enteric neurons via serotonin-mediated signaling and promote gut motility ( Yao and Scott , 2022 ) . We tested whether TaG-EM could be used to measure the effect of caffeine on food transit time in larvae . As with prior behavioral tests , the TaG-EM data recapitulated the results seen in the manual assay ( Figure 4D ) . Conducting the transit assay via TaG-EM enables several labor-saving steps . First , rather than counting the number of larvae with and without a food bolus at each time point , one simply needs to transfer non-bolus-containing larvae to a collection tube . Second , because the TaG-EM lines are genetically barcoded , all the conditions can be tested at once on a single plate , removing the need to separately count each replicate of each experimental condition . This reduces the hands-on time for the assay to just a few minutes per hour . A summary of the anticipated cost and labor savings for the TaG-EM-based food transit assay is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 . To facilitate representation of the TaG-EM barcodes in single-cell sequencing data , genetic barcodes were placed just upstream of the polyadenylation signal sequences and poly-A cleavage sites ( Figure 1A ) . To verify that the inserted sequences did not interfere with Gal4-driven GFP expression , we crossed each of the barcoded TaG-EM lines to decapentaplegic-Gal4 ( dpp-Gal4 ) . We observed GFP expression in the expected characteristic central stripe ( Teleman and Cohen , 2000 ) in the wing imaginal disc for 19/20 lines at similar expression levels to the base pJFRC12 UAS-myr::GFP construct inserted in the same landing site ( Figure 5A , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . No GFP expression was visible for TaG-EM barcode number 8 , which upon molecular characterization had an 853 bp deletion within the GFP coding region ( data not shown ) . We generated and tested GFP expression of an additional 156 TaG-EM barcode lines ( Alegria et al . , 2024 ) , by crossing them to Mhc-Gal4 and observing expression in the adult thorax . All 156 additional TaG-EM lines had robust GFP expression ( data not shown ) . Gal4-driven expression levels of TaG-EM barcoded GFP constructs were also similar to that of the pJFRC12 base construct for multiple driver lines ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) indicating that the presence of the barcode does not generally impair expression of GFP . While with some driver lines , expression of the myr::GFP from the TaG-EM construct may be too weak to allow robust enrichment of the tagged cells , adding an additional hexameric GFP construct ( Shearin et al . , 2014 ) could boost expression of weak driver lines to levels that are sufficient for robust detection of labeled flies or larvae ( Figure 5B ) and for labeling of dissociated cells for flow cytometry ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Stocks with an additional UAS hexameric GFP construct recombined onto the same chromosome as the TaG-EM construct have been established for 20 TaG-EM barcode lines . To test whether we could detect TaG-EM barcodes in single-cell sequencing data , we crossed three TaG-EM barcode lines to two different gut Gal4 driver lines ( Ariyapala et al . , 2020 ) , one expressing in the enterocytes ( EC-Gal4: TaG-EM barcodes 1 , 2 , and 3 ) and the other in intestinal precursor cells ( PC-Gal4: TaG-EM barcodes 7 , 8 , and 9 ) , which includes stem cells and enteroblasts ( EBs ) . Due to weak GFP expression with the EC-Gal4 driver , we did not see visible GFP positive cells for this driver line . The PC-Gal4 driver line contained an additional UAS-Stinger ( 2xGFP ) construct and expressed GFP at a level sufficient for flow sorting when crossed to the TaG-EM line ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . Larval guts were dissected , dissociated , stained with propidium iodide ( PI ) to label dead cells , and flow sorted to recover PI-negative and GFP-positive cells . Approximately 10 , 000 cells were loaded into a 10x Genomics droplet generator and a single-cell library was prepared and sequenced . Two clusters were observed in the resulting sequencing data , one of which had high read counts from mitochondrial genes suggesting that this cluster consisted of mitochondria , debris , or dead and dying cells . After filtering the cells with high mitochondrial reads , a single cluster remained ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . This cluster expressed known intestinal precursor cell markers such as escargot ( esg ) , klumpfuss ( klu ) , and Notch pathway genes like E ( spl ) mbeta-HLH ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . Expression of all three PC-Gal4-driven TaG-EM barcodes was observed in this cluster ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) indicating that TaG-EM barcodes can be detected in single-cell sequencing data . Interestingly , TaG-EM barcode 8 , for which no GFP expression was observed , was represented in the single-cell sequencing data indicating that the lesion in the GFP coding region does not prevent mRNA expression for this line . A previous study used droplet-based single-cell sequencing to characterize the cell types that make up the adult midgut ( Hung et al . , 2020 ) . This study took advantage of two fluorescent protein markers , an escargot ( esg ) -GFP fusion protein and a prospero ( pros ) -Gal4-driven RFP to label the intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) and enteroendocrine cells ( EEs ) , respectively ( Hung et al . , 2020 ) . The authors compared the resulting clusters to a list of known marker genes in the literature , including antibody staining , GFP , LacZ , and Gal4 reporter expression patterns to classify the cells in individual clusters , and also found that the esg-GFP expression was present in a broader subset of cells than anticipated . Thus , most of these cell classifications relied upon inference as opposed to direct positive labeling . Recently , a large collection of split-Gal4 lines were screened for expression in the adult and larval gut ( Ariyapala et al . , 2020 ) . These include pan-midgut driver lines , split-Gal4 lines specific for the EBs , ECs , EEs , and ISC/EBs , as well as driver lines with regionalized gene expression . We crossed four different TaG-EM barcode lines with the pan-midgut driver ( PMG-Gal4: TaG-EM barcodes 1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 ) , and one barcode line to each of the precursor cell ( PC-Gal4: TaG-EM barcode 5 ) , enterocyte ( EC-Gal4: TaG-EM barcode 4 ) , enteroblast ( EB-Gal4: TaG-EM barcode 6 ) , and enteroendocrine ( EE-Gal4: TaG-EM barcode 9 ) drivers ( Ariyapala et al . , 2020 ) . Larval guts were dissected from these lines and cells were dissociated , flow sorted as described above to select live , GFP-positive cells , and approximately 30 , 000 cells were loaded into a 10x Genomics droplet generator for single-cell sequencing ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ) . Using the additional hexameric GFP construct to boost GFP expression resulted in visible fluorescent signal for all eight barcode Gal4 line combinations . An advantage of cell barcoding both for cell hashing ( Stoeckius et al . , 2018 ) and for TaG-EM in vivo barcoding is that such labeling facilitates the identification and removal of multiplets , which are an artifact of droplet-based single-cell sequencing approaches . After filtering and removing cells with a high percentage of mitochondrial or ribosomal reads , we used DoubletFinder ( McGinnis et al . , 2019 ) to computationally identify multiplet droplets . In parallel , we searched for cells that co-expressed multiple TaG-EM barcodes . DoubletFinder identified 2019 multiplet droplets , while TaG-EM barcodes identified 298 such droplets , 198 of which ( 66 . 4% ) overlapped with those identified by DoubletFinder ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 ) . Thus , TaG-EM help identify an additional 100 doublets that would have otherwise been overlooked using computational doublet identification methods . After doublet removal , the remaining cells were clustered ( Figure 6A , Figure 6—figure supplement 6 ) and analyzed using Seurat ( Satija et al . , 2015 ) . Analysis of differentially expressed genes identified clusters expressing marker genes previously reported for adult gut cell types ( Hung et al . , 2020 ) . These included genes associated with precursor cells ( Notch pathway genes ) , enterocytes ( trypsins , serine proteases , amalyse , mannosidases ) , and enteroendocrine cells neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors; ( Figure 6—figure supplement 7 , data not shown ) . TaG-EM barcodes derived from the eight multiplexed genotypes were observed in approximately one-quarter of the cells ( Figure 6—figure supplement 7 ) . In antibody-conjugated oligo cell hashing approaches , sparsity of barcode representation is overcome by spiking in an additional primer at the cDNA amplification step and amplifying the hashtag oligo by PCR . We employed a similar approach to attempt to enrich for TaG-EM barcodes in an additional library sequenced separately from the 10x Genomics gene expression library . Our initial attempts at barcode enrichment using spike-in and enrichment primers corresponding to the TaG-EM PCR handle were unsuccessful ( Figure 6—figure supplement 8 ) . However , we subsequently optimized the TaG-EM barcode enrichment by ( 1 ) using a longer spike-in primer that more closely matches the annealing temperature used during the 10x Genomics cDNA creation step , and ( 2 ) using a nested PCR approach to amplify the cell-barcode and unique molecular identifier ( UMI ) -labeled TaG-EM barcodes ( Figure 6—figure supplement 8 ) . Using the enriched library , TaG-EM barcodes were detected in nearly 100% of the cells at high sequencing depths ( Figure 6—figure supplement 9 ) . However , although we used a polymerase that has been engineered to have high processivity and that has been shown to reduce the formation of chimeric reads in other contexts ( Gohl et al . , 2016 ) , it is possible that PCR chimeras could lead to unreliable detection events for some cells . Indeed , many cells had a mixture of barcodes detected with low counts and single or low numbers of associated UMIs . To assess the reliability of detection , we analyzed the correlation between barcodes detected in the gene expression library and the enriched TaG-EM barcode library as a function of the purity of TaG-EM barcode detection for each cell ( the percentage of the most abundant detected TaG-EM barcode , Figure 6—figure supplement 9 ) . For TaG-EM barcode detections where the most abundance barcode was a high percentage of the total barcode reads detected ( ~75%–99 . 99% ) , there was a high correlation between the barcode detected in the gene expression library and the enriched TaG-EM barcode library . Below this threshold , the correlation was substantially reduced . In the enriched library , we identified 26 . 8% of cells with a TaG-EM barcode reliably detected , a very modest improvement over the gene expression library alone ( 23 . 96% ) , indicating that at least for this experiment , the main constraint is sufficient expression of the TaG-EM barcode and not detection . To identify TaG-EM barcodes in the combined data set , we counted a positive detection as any barcode either identified in the gene expression library or any barcode identified in the enriched library with a purity of >75% . In the case of conflicting barcode calls , we assigned the barcode that was detected directly in the gene expression library . This increased the total fraction of cells where a barcode was identified to approximately 37% ( Figure 6B ) . As expected , the barcodes expressed by the pan-midgut driver were broadly distributed across the cell clusters ( Figure 6—figure supplement 10 ) . However , the number of cells recovered varied significantly among the four pan-midgut driver associated barcodes . Expression of the cell-type-specific barcodes showed more restricted patterns of expression among the cell clusters and were co-localized with known marker genes for these cell types ( Figure 6C–N ) . For instance , TaG-EM barcode 6 , driven by the EB-Gal4 line , was expressed primarily in cells that were annotated as enteroblasts ( Figure 6C–D ) and that expressed precursor cell markers such as esg ( Figure 6E ) , klu ( Figure 6F ) , and Notch pathway genes such as e ( spl ) mbeta-HLH and e ( spl ) m3-HLH ( not shown ) . TaG-EM barcode 4 expression , which was driven by the EC-Gal4 line , was seen primarily in a cluster that was annotated as enterocytes ( Figure 6G–H ) and that expressed enterocyte markers such as the serine protease Jon99Ciii and other enterocyte marker genes such as the amylase , Amy-d ( not shown ) , but not the beta-Trypsin ( betaTry ) gene ( Figure 6I–J ) . Detailed characterization of the EC-Gal4 line indicated that although this line labeled a high percentage of enterocytes , expression was restricted to an area at the anterior and middle of the midgut , with gaps between these regions and at the posterior ( Figure 6—figure supplement 11 ) . This could explain the absence of subsets of enterocytes , such as those labeled by betaTry , which exhibits regional expression in R2 of the adult midgut ( Buchon et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , expression of TaG-EM barcode 9 , which was expressed using the EE-Gal4 driver line , was observed in clusters annotated as enteroendocrine cells ( Figure 6K–L ) and that also expressed enteroendocrine cell derived neuropeptide genes such as Dh31 ( Figure 6M ) and other enteroendocrine markers such as IA-2 , a tyrosine phosphatase involved in the secretion of insulin-like peptide ( Figure 6N ) . Detailed characterization of the EE-Gal4 driver line indicated that ~80–85% of Prospero-positive enteroendocrine cells are labeled in the anterior and middle of the larval midgut , with a lower percentage ( ~65% ) of Prospero-positive cells labeled in the posterior midgut ( Figure 6—figure supplement 11 ) . As with the enterocyte labeling , and consistent with the Gal4 driver expression pattern , the EE-Gal4 expressed TaG-EM barcode 9 did not label all classes of enteroendocrine cells and other clusters of presumptive enteroendocrine cells expressing other neuropeptides such as Orcokinin , AstA , and AstC , or neuropeptide receptors such as CCHa2 ( not shown ) were also observed . The EE-Gal4 driver uses Dh31 regulatory elements , so it is not surprising that the TaG-EM barcodes specifically labeled Dh31-positive enteroendocrine cells and this result further highlights the ability to target specific genetically defined cell types using TaG-EM based on in vivo cell labeling . Taken together , these results demonstrate that TaG-EM can be used to label specific cell populations that correlate with Gal4-driven expression patterns in vivo for subsequent identification in single-cell sequencing data . \n Advances in next-generation sequencing , as well as single-cell and spatial genomics are enabling new types of detailed analyses to study important biological processes such as development and nervous system function . Here , we describe TaG-EM , a genetic barcoding strategy that enables novel capabilities in several different experimental contexts ( Figure 1 ) . We demonstrate that the genetic barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded fly lines using next-generation sequencing . Analysis of structured pools of flies with defined inputs suggests that TaG-EM barcode measurements are highly accurate and reproducible , particularly in cases where multiple barcodes are used to label an experimental condition and averaged ( Figure 2 ) . Sequencing-based TaG-EM measurements recapitulated more laborious , one-at-a-time measurements in a phototaxis assay , an age-dependent fecundity assay , and a gut motility assay , demonstrating that TaG-EM can be used to measure behavior or other phenotypes in multiplexed , pooled populations ( Figures 3–4 ) . We did note that one line ( TaG-EM barcode 14 ) exhibited poor performance in oviposition assays , suggesting that barcode performance should be verified for a specific assay . We excluded this poor performing barcode line from the fecundity tests; however , backcrossing is often used to bring reagents into a consistent genetic background for behavioral experiments and could also potentially be used to address behavior-specific issues with specific TaG-EM lines . In addition , other strategies such as averaging across multiple barcode lines ( 3–4 per condition , which yielded R2 values >0 . 99 in tests with structured pools ) or permutation of barcode assignment across replicates could also mitigate such deficiencies . Currently , up to 176 conditions can be multiplexed in a single pooled experiment with existing TaG-EM lines , but because sequencing indices can be added after amplification in a separate indexing PCR step , many hundreds or even thousands of such experiments can be multiplexed in a single-sequencing run . While the utility of TaG-EM barcode-based quantification will vary based on the number of conditions being analyzed and the ease of quantifying the behavior or phenotype by other means , we demonstrate that TaG-EM can be employed to cost-effectively streamline labor-intensive assays and to quantify phenotypes with small effect sizes ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . An additional benefit of multiplexed TaG-EM behavioral measurements is that the experimental conditions are effectively blinded as the multiplexed conditions are intermingled in a single assay . In addition , we show that TaG-EM barcodes can be expressed by tissue-specific Gal4 drivers and used to tag specific cell populations upstream of single-cell sequencing ( Figures 5–6 ) . This capability will allow for positive identification of cell clusters in cell atlas projects and will facilitate multiplexing of single-cell sequencing experiments . Recently , a conceptually similar approach called RABID-Seq ( Clark et al . , 2021 ) has been described , which allows trans-synaptic labeling of neural circuits using barcoded viral transcripts . However , one distinction between the two approaches is that RABID-Seq relies on stochastic viral infection of mammalian cells while TaG-EM allows reproducible targeting of defined cell populations allowing unambiguous cell identification and potentially allowing the same cell populations to be assessed at different timepoints or in the context of different experimental manipulations . One current limitation is that TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data . It is likely that the strength of the Gal4 driver contributes to the labeling density . However , we also observed variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes that were all driven by the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver ( Figure 6—figure supplement 10 ) . For single-cell RNA-Seq experiments , the cost savings of multiplexing is roughly the cost of a run divided by the number of independent lines multiplexed , plus labor savings by also being able to multiplex upstream flow cytometry , minus loss of unbarcoded cells . Our experiments indicated that for the specific drivers we tested TaG-EM barcodes are detected in around one quarter of the cells if relying on endogenous expression in the gene expression library , though this fraction was higher ( ~37% ) if sequencing an enriched TaG-EM barcode library in parallel ( Figure 6 , Figure 6—figure supplement 8 and Figure 6—figure supplement 9 ) . In the future , generation of additional TaG-EM lines will enable higher levels of multiplexing . In addition , while the original TaG-EM lines were made using a membrane-localized myr::GFP construct , variants that express GFP in other cell compartments such as the cytoplasm or nucleus could be constructed to enable increased expression levels or purification of nuclei . Nuclear labeling could also be achieved by co-expressing a nuclear GFP construct with existing TaG-EM lines in analogy to the use of hexameric GFP described above . In summary , combined with the large collections of Gal4 and split-Gal4 lines that have been established in Drosophila that enable precise targeting of a high proportion of cell types ( Ariyapala et al . , 2020; Aso et al . , 2014; Davis et al . , 2020; Gohl et al . , 2011; Kanca et al . , 2022; Namiki et al . , 2018; Pfeiffer et al . , 2010; Pfeiffer et al . , 2008; Venken et al . , 2011; Zirin et al . , 2024 ) , TaG-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing . Moreover , these genetic barcodes can be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements . Thus , TaG-EM provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms . \n Drosophila stocks were grown at 22 °C on cornmeal agar unless otherwise indicated .

The gBlock was resuspended in 20 µl EB , incubated at 50 °C for 20 min and then cut with PsiI and EcoRI ( New England Biolabs , NEB ) using the following reaction conditions: 4 µl gBlock DNA ( 35 ng ) , 2 µl 10 x CutSmart buffer ( NEB ) , 1 µl EcoRI enzyme ( NEB ) , 1 µl PsiI enzyme ( NEB ) , and 12 µl nuclease-free water were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr followed by 65 °C for 20 min to heat inactivate the restriction enzymes . pJFRC12-10XUAS-IVS-myr::GFP plasmid ( Addgene , Plasmid #26222; Pfeiffer et al . , 2010 ) was digested with the following reaction conditions: 5 µl pJFRC12-10XUAS-IVS-myr::GFP plasmid DNA ( ~3 µg ) , 5 µl 10 x CutSmart buffer ( NEB ) , 1 µl PsiI enzyme ( NEB ) , 1 µl EcoRI enzyme ( NEB ) , and 38 µl nuclease-free water , were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr , followed by addition of 1 µl of CIP and incubation for an additional 30 min . The digested vector backbone was gel purified using the QiaQuick Gel Purification Kit ( QIAGEN ) . The digested gBlock was ligated into the digested pJFRC12-10XUAS-IVS-myr::GFP backbone using the following reactions conditions: 4 µl T4 ligase buffer ( 10 x; NEB ) , 20 µl plasmid backbone DNA ( 0 . 005 pmol ) , 5 µl gBlock digest DNA ( 0 . 03 pmol ) , 2 µl of T4 DNA ligase ( NEB ) , and 9 µl nuclease-free water were mixed and incubated at 22 °C for 2 hr . 2 µl of the ligation reaction was transformed into 50 µl of TOP10 competent cells ( Invitrogen ) , and the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min , then heat shocked at 42 °C for 30 s , and incubated on ice for 5 min . 250 µl SOC was added and the cells were plated on LB +ampicillin plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C . DNA was isolated from 36 pJFRC12-gBlock colonies using a QIAprep Spin MiniPrep kit ( QIAGEN ) . Expected construct size was verified by diagnostic digest with EcoRI and ApaLI . DNA concentration was determined using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and the randomer barcode for each of the constructs was determined by Sanger sequencing using the following primers: 29 sequence verified constructs were normalized , pooled evenly , and injected as a pool into embryos ( Rubin and Spradling , 1982 ) expressing PhiC31 integrase and the carrying the attP2 landing site ( BDSC #25710 ) . Injected flies were outcrossed to w- flies , and up to three white +progeny per cross were identified , and the transgenic lines were homozygosed . DNA was extracted ( GeneJET genomic DNA purification Kit , Thermo Scientific ) and the region containing the DNA barcode was amplified with the following PCR reaction: 2 . 5 µl 1:10 diluted template DNA , 2 µl 10 x Reaction Buffer ( QIAGEN ) , 0 . 2 µl dNTP mix ( 10 µM ) , 1 µl 10 µM SV40_5 F primer ( 10 µM ) , 1 µl SV40_post_R primer ( 10 µM ) , 0 . 8 µl MgCl2 ( 3 mM ) , 0 . 1 µl Taq polymerase ( QIAGEN ) , 12 . 4 µl nuclease-free water . Reactions were amplified using the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min , followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s , 55 °C for 30 s , 72 °C for 30 s , followed by 72 °C for 5 min . PCR products were treated with Exo-CIP using the following reaction conditions: 5 µl PCR product , 1 µl Exo-CIP Tube A ( NEB ) , 1 µl Exo-CIP Tube B ( NEB ) were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 4 min , followed by 80 °C for 1 min . The barcode sequence for each of the independent transgenic lines was determined by Sanger sequencing using the SV40_5 F and SV40_PostR primers . Transgenic lines containing 20 distinct DNA barcodes were recovered ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . An additional 156 TaG-EM barcode lines were isolated and sequence verified as described in a separate publication ( Alegria et al . , 2024 ) . The following primers were evaluated to amplify the TaG-EM barcodes upstream of NGS: Forward primer pool: four primers with frameshifting bases to increase library sequence diversity in initial sequencing cycles were normalized to 10 µM and pooled evenly to make a B2_3’F1_Nextera_0–6 primer pool: SV40_pre_R_nextera is designed to produce a shorter amplicon ( 200 bp with Illumina adapters and indices added ) and SV40-post_R_Nextera is designed to produce a longer amplicon ( 290 bp with Illumina adapters and indices added ) . An initial test was performed with three different polymerases ( NEB Q5 , KAPA HiFi , and Qiagen Taq ) at two different annealing temperatures and with both the B2_3'F1_Nextera/ SV40_pre_R_Nextera and B2_3'F1_Nextera/ SV40_post_R_Nextera primer sets to determine whether the primers amplify as expected ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Two different samples were tested: Set up the following PCR reactions: Male or female flies from TaG-EM barcode lines were pooled in either an even or staggered manner ( Figure 2A ) . For the even pools , three independently pooled samples were constructed in order to assess sample-to-sample variability . DNA was extracted from these structured pools using a protocol adapted from Huang et al . , 2009 ( Huang et al . , 2009 ) , using homemade SPRI beads ( DeAngelis et al . , 1995 ) in the last purification step and amplified in triplicate using 2 . 5 µl template DNA ( 50 ng ) , 1 µl 10 µM B2_Nextera_F 0–6 primers ( 10 µM ) , 1 µl SV40_pre_R_Nextera ( 10 µM ) , 10 µl 2 x KAPA HiFi ReadyMix ( Roche ) , 5 . 5 µl nuclease-free water . Reactions were amplified using the following cycling conditions: 98 °C for 5 min , followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s , 60 °C for 15 s , 72 °C for 30 s , followed by 72 °C for 5 min . Amplicons were indexed , normalized , quantified , and prepared for sequencing as described above . Newly hatched flies ( males and females ) from three barcode lines were collected at 1-week intervals during 4 consecutive weeks ( 12 barcode lines in total ) . Fresh fly food was provided every 3–4 days . Ten days after the last collection , 10 females from each barcode line were taken and pooled together in a collection cage ( 10 females x 12 barcode lines = 120 females ) . The remaining females from each barcode line were separated from the males and put in individual collection cages . Two days later , the experiment started and was run for 3 consecutive days . Each day a 1–1 . 5 hr pre-collection was followed by a 6 hr collection , both at 25 °C . 100 embryos from each individual collection plate were transferred to new plates and incubated for 2 days at 18 °C . The number of hatched larvae were counted and used to calculate the egg survival rate . The pooled collection plate was also incubated at 18 °C and the next day the embryos were dechorionated and frozen . The 12 individual collection plates were kept at 4 °C and the number of embryos counted in the following days . For the barcode measurements , DNA was extracted from the embryos , and amplified using 2 . 5 µl template DNA ( 50 ng ) , 1 µl 10 µM B2_Nextera_F 0–6 primers ( 10 µM ) , 1 µl SV40_pre_R_Nextera ( 10 µM ) , 10 µl 2 x KAPA HiFi ReadyMix ( Roche ) , 5 . 5 µl nuclease-free water . Reactions were amplified using the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 5 min , followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s , 60 °C for 15 s , 72 °C for 30 s , followed by 72 °C for 5 min . Amplicons were indexed , normalized , quantified , and prepared for sequencing as described above . Midguts from third instar larvae of driver lines crossed to UAS-GFP . nls or UAS-mCherry were dissected in 1xPBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) overnight at 4 °C . Fixed samples were washed with 0 . 1% PBTx ( 1 x PBS +0 . 1% Triton X-100 ) three times for 10 min each and blocked in PBTxGS ( 0 . 1% PBTx +3% Normal Goat Serum ) for 2–4 hr at RT . After blocking , midguts were incubated in primary antibody solution overnight at 4 °C . The next day samples were washed with 0 . 1% PBTx three times for 20 min each and were incubated in secondary antibody solution for 2–3 hr at RT ( protected from light ) followed by three washes with 0 . 1% PBTx for 20 min each . One µg/ml DAPI solution prepared in 0 . 1% PBTx was added to the sample and incubated for 10 min followed by washing with 0 . 1% PBTx three times for 10 min each . Finally , samples were mounted on a slide glass with 70% glycerol and imaged using a Nikon AX R confocal microscope . Confocal images were processed using Fiji software . The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-GFP ( A6455 , 1:1000 Invitrogen ) , mouse anti-mCherry ( 3A11 , 1:20 DSHB ) , mouse anti-Prospero ( MR1A , 1:50 DSHB ) and mouse anti-Pdm1 ( Nub 2D4 , 1:30 DSHB ) . The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 647 and Alexa 488 ( 1:200; Invitrogen ) , respectively . Five larval gut specimens per Gal4 line were dissected and examined . Midguts from 3rd instar larvae were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes on ice containing PBS +30% normal goat serum ( NGS ) . After dissection , 150 µL of 2 . 7 mg/mL elastase was added to each sample tube . The tubes were then incubated at 27 °C for 1 hr . During incubation , samples were mixed by pipetting ~30 times every 15 min to improve elastase dissociation of the cells . Samples were then filtered through a 40 µM FlowMi tip filter ( Bel-Art ) to reduce debris . Afterwards , the samples were quantified on the LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter ( Logos Biosystems ) using 9 µL of sample to 1 µL AO/PI dye to ensure there were enough viable cells for flow sorting . Once quantified , the samples were brought up to a volume of ~1 . 1 mL with the PBS +30% NGS solution to facilitate flow sorting . The samples were then fluorescently sorted on a FACSAria II Cell Sorter ( BD Biosciences ) to isolate GFP + cells . Following sorting , samples were centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min to concentrate the cells . The supernatant was aspirated off until 50 µL cell concentrate remained in each sample . Then , the samples were carefully resuspended using wide bore pipette tips before being combined into one sample tube . This sample was quantified on the LUNA-FL Dual Fluorescence Cell Counter ( Logos Biosystems ) as described above . If necessary , cells were centrifuged , concentrated , and re-counted . The resulting pool was prepared for sequencing following the 10x Genomics Single Cell 3’ protocol ( version CG000315 Rev C ) , At step 2 . 2 of the protocol , cDNA amplification , 1 µl of TaG-EM spike-in primer ( 10 µM ) was added to the reaction to amplify cDNA with the TaG-EM barcode . Gene expression cDNA and TaG-EM cDNA were separated using a double-sided SPRIselect ( Beckman Coulter ) bead clean up following 10x Genomics Single Cell 3’ Feature Barcode protocol , step 2 . 3 ( version CG000317 Rev E ) . The gene expression cDNA was created into a library following the CG000315 Rev C protocol starting at section 3 . Custom nested primers were used for enrichment of TaG-EM barcodes after cDNA creation using PCR . The following primers were tested ( see Figure 6—figure supplement 8 ) : After multiple optimization trials , the following steps yielded ~96% on-target reads for the TaG-EM library ( Figure 6—figure supplement 8 , note that for the enriched barcode data shown in Figure 6 , Figure 6—figure supplement 9 , a similar amplification protocol was used TaG-EM barcodes were amplified from the gene expression library cDNA and not the SPRI-selected barcode pool ) . TaG-EM cDNA was amplified with the following PCR reaction: 5 µl purified TaG-EM cDNA , 50 µl 2 x KAPA HiFi ReadyMix ( Roche ) , 2 . 5 µl UMGC_IL_DoubleNest primer ( 10 µM ) , 2 . 5 µl SI_PCR primer ( 10 µM ) , and 40 µl nuclease-free water . The reaction was amplified using the following cycling conditions: 98 °C for 2 min , followed by 15 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s , 63 °C for 30 s , 72 °C for 20 s , followed by 72 °C for 5 min . After the first PCR , the amplified cDNA was purified with a 1 . 2 x SPRIselect ( Beckman Coulter ) bead cleanup with 80% ethanol washes and eluted into 40 µL of nuclease-water . A second round of PCR was run with following reaction: 5 µl purified TaG-EM cDNA , 50 µl 2 x KAPA HiFi ReadyMix ( Roche ) , 2 . 5 µl D702 primer ( 10 µM ) , 2 . 5 µl p5 Primer ( 10 µM ) , and 40 µl nuclease-free water . The reaction was amplified using the following cycling conditions: 98 °C for 2 min , followed by 10 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s , 63 °C for 30 s , 72 °C for 20 s , followed by 72 °C for 5 min . After the second PCR , the amplified cDNA was purified with a 1 . 2 x SPRIselect ( Beckman Coulter ) bead cleanup with 80% ethanol washes and eluted into 40 µL of nuclease-water . The resulting 3’ gene expression library and TaG-EM enrichment library were sequenced together following Scenario 1 of the BioLegend ‘Total-Seq-A Antibodies and Cell Hashing with 10x Single Cell 3’ Reagents Kit v3 or v3 . 1’ protocol . Additional sequencing of the enriched TaG-EM library also done following Scenario 2 from the same protocol . Libraries for TaG-EM barcode analysis from structured pools or from phototaxis or oviposition experiments were denatured with NaOH and prepared for sequencing according to the protocols described in the Illumina MiSeq Denature and Dilute Libraries Guides . Single-cell libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 2000 or Illumina NovaSeq 6000 . One of the single-cell enriched TaG-EM barcode libraries was sequenced on an Element Aviti sequencer following the manufacturers loading instructions .",

         "However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing  , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . By creating many such independently barcoded fly strains , TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects , identification of multiplet droplets , and barcoding of experimental timepoints , conditions , and replicates . Furthermore , we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments . Single-cell sequencing technologies have provided insights into the dynamics of gene expression throughout development , been used to characterize somatic variation and heterogeneity within tissues , and are currently enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases  . However , linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and positively identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge . The cellular identities of gene expression clusters identified in cell atlas data sets are typically inferred from the expression of distinctive gene sets  , and the lack of positive identification of gene expression clusters introduces an element of uncertainty in this analysis . Antibody-based cell hashing or feature barcoding approaches have been developed to allow multiplexing of samples in droplet-based single-cell sequencing reactions  . In addition , other multiplexing strategies for single-cell sequencing based on alternative methods for tagging cells  or making use of natural genetic variation have been used  . This method , called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing  , involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the poly-adenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population of interest . Flies carrying TaG-EM barcodes can be exposed to different experimental perturbations and then tested in assays where flies , larvae , or embryos are fractionated based on behavioral outcomes or other phenotypes . Thus , TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale next-generation sequencing  -based behavioral or other fractionation screens analogous to BAR-Seq or Tn-Seq approaches employed in microbial organisms . We cloned a fragment containing a PCR handle sequence and a diverse 14 bp barcode sequence into the SV40 3’ untranslated region  sequence just upstream of the polyadenylation sites in the 10xUAS-myr::GFP  backbone  . Such barcoded fly lines have the potential to enable population behavioral measurements , where different exposures , experimental timepoints , and genetic or neural perturbations can be multiplexed and analyzed by measuring barcode abundance in sequencing data  . In addition , the barcodes , which reside on a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct , can be expressed tissue-specifically and read out during droplet-based single-cell sequencing , labeling a cell population and/or an experimental condition of interest  . We conducted initial experiments to optimize amplification of the genetic barcodes using primers targeting the PCR handle inserted just upstream of the 14 bp barcode sequence and PCR primers downstream of the TaG-EM barcode in the SV40 3’ UTR sequence  . To test the accuracy and reproducibility of sequencing-based measurements of TaG-EM barcodes , we constructed structured pools containing defined numbers of flies pooled either evenly with each of the 20 barcode constructs comprising 5% of the pool , or in a staggered manner with sets of barcodes differing in abundance in 2-fold increments  . To examine the impact of technical steps such as DNA extraction and PCR amplification on TaG-EM barcode measurements , even pools were made and extracted in triplicate and amplicon sequencing libraries were made in triplicate for each independently extracted DNA sample for both the even and staggered pools . The coefficients of variation were largely consistent for groups of TaG-EM barcodes pooled evenly or at different levels within the staggered pools  . This indicates that a high level of quantitative accuracy can be attained using sequencing-based analysis of TaG-EM barcode abundance , particularly when averaging data for three to four independent barcodes for an experimental condition . Next , we tested whether TaG-EM could be used to measure a phototaxis behavior . Preference indices calculated for the pooled , NGS-based TaG-EM measurements were nearly identical to conventional behavioral measurements for both wild type and norpA mutants  . Fertilized females from each of the 20 barcode lines were placed together in egg laying cups , embryos were collected , aged for 12 hr to enable cell numbers to stabilize in the developing eggs , and then DNA was extracted from both the pooled adult flies and the embryos . In general , TaG-EM measurements of oviposition correlated with fly numbers , with the exception of barcode 14 which had reduced barcode abundance across multiple trials  . This suggests that despite the fact that the genetic barcode constructs are inserted in a common landing site , differences with respect to specific behaviors may exist among the lines , and thus one should test to make sure given lines are appropriate to use in specific behavioral assays . To determine whether TaG-EM could be used to measure age-dependent fecundity , we collected flies from twelve different TaG-EM barcode lines at four time points separated by 1 week  . These eggs were aged , DNA was extracted , and the TaG-EM barcodes were amplified and sequenced . Manually scored viable egg numbers and TaG-EM barcode abundances were well correlated across two independent experimental trials  . Thus , we decided to test whether food transit could be quantified in a more streamlined and scalable fashion by using TaG-EM  . We tested whether TaG-EM could be used to measure the effect of caffeine on food transit time in larvae . Second , because the TaG-EM lines are genetically barcoded , all the conditions can be tested at once on a single plate , removing the need to separately count each replicate of each experimental condition . A summary of the anticipated cost and labor savings for the TaG-EM-based food transit assay is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 . To facilitate representation of the TaG-EM barcodes in single-cell sequencing data , genetic barcodes were placed just upstream of the polyadenylation signal sequences and poly-A cleavage sites  . To verify that the inserted sequences did not interfere with Gal4-driven GFP expression , we crossed each of the barcoded TaG-EM lines to decapentaplegic-Gal4  . No GFP expression was visible for TaG-EM barcode number 8 , which upon molecular characterization had an 853 bp deletion within the GFP coding region  . We generated and tested GFP expression of an additional 156 TaG-EM barcode lines  , by crossing them to Mhc-Gal4 and observing expression in the adult thorax . All 156 additional TaG-EM lines had robust GFP expression  . Gal4-driven expression levels of TaG-EM barcoded GFP constructs were also similar to that of the pJFRC12 base construct for multiple driver lines  indicating that the presence of the barcode does not generally impair expression of GFP . While with some driver lines , expression of the myr::GFP from the TaG-EM construct may be too weak to allow robust enrichment of the tagged cells , adding an additional hexameric GFP construct  could boost expression of weak driver lines to levels that are sufficient for robust detection of labeled flies or larvae  and for labeling of dissociated cells for flow cytometry  . Stocks with an additional UAS hexameric GFP construct recombined onto the same chromosome as the TaG-EM construct have been established for 20 TaG-EM barcode lines . To test whether we could detect TaG-EM barcodes in single-cell sequencing data , we crossed three TaG-EM barcode lines to two different gut Gal4 driver lines  , one expressing in the enterocytes  and the other in intestinal precursor cells  , which includes stem cells and enteroblasts  . Due to weak GFP expression with the EC-Gal4 driver , we did not see visible GFP positive cells for this driver line . The PC-Gal4 driver line contained an additional UAS-Stinger  construct and expressed GFP at a level sufficient for flow sorting when crossed to the TaG-EM line  . Expression of all three PC-Gal4-driven TaG-EM barcodes was observed in this cluster  indicating that TaG-EM barcodes can be detected in single-cell sequencing data . Interestingly , TaG-EM barcode 8 , for which no GFP expression was observed , was represented in the single-cell sequencing data indicating that the lesion in the GFP coding region does not prevent mRNA expression for this line . This study took advantage of two fluorescent protein markers , an escargot  -GFP fusion protein and a prospero  -Gal4-driven RFP to label the intestinal stem cells  and enteroendocrine cells  , respectively  . The authors compared the resulting clusters to a list of known marker genes in the literature , including antibody staining , GFP , LacZ , and Gal4 reporter expression patterns to classify the cells in individual clusters , and also found that the esg-GFP expression was present in a broader subset of cells than anticipated . These include pan-midgut driver lines , split-Gal4 lines specific for the EBs , ECs , EEs , and ISC/EBs , as well as driver lines with regionalized gene expression . We crossed four different TaG-EM barcode lines with the pan-midgut driver  , and one barcode line to each of the precursor cell  , enterocyte  , enteroblast  , and enteroendocrine  drivers  . Larval guts were dissected from these lines and cells were dissociated , flow sorted as described above to select live , GFP-positive cells , and approximately 30 , 000 cells were loaded into a 10x Genomics droplet generator for single-cell sequencing  . Using the additional hexameric GFP construct to boost GFP expression resulted in visible fluorescent signal for all eight barcode Gal4 line combinations . An advantage of cell barcoding both for cell hashing  and for TaG-EM in vivo barcoding is that such labeling facilitates the identification and removal of multiplets , which are an artifact of droplet-based single-cell sequencing approaches . In parallel , we searched for cells that co-expressed multiple TaG-EM barcodes . DoubletFinder identified 2019 multiplet droplets , while TaG-EM barcodes identified 298 such droplets , 198 of which  overlapped with those identified by DoubletFinder  . Thus , TaG-EM help identify an additional 100 doublets that would have otherwise been overlooked using computational doublet identification methods . TaG-EM barcodes derived from the eight multiplexed genotypes were observed in approximately one-quarter of the cells  . In antibody-conjugated oligo cell hashing approaches , sparsity of barcode representation is overcome by spiking in an additional primer at the cDNA amplification step and amplifying the hashtag oligo by PCR . We employed a similar approach to attempt to enrich for TaG-EM barcodes in an additional library sequenced separately from the 10x Genomics gene expression library . Our initial attempts at barcode enrichment using spike-in and enrichment primers corresponding to the TaG-EM PCR handle were unsuccessful  . However , we subsequently optimized the TaG-EM barcode enrichment by  using a longer spike-in primer that more closely matches the annealing temperature used during the 10x Genomics cDNA creation step , and  using a nested PCR approach to amplify the cell-barcode and unique molecular identifier  -labeled TaG-EM barcodes  . Using the enriched library , TaG-EM barcodes were detected in nearly 100% of the cells at high sequencing depths  . To assess the reliability of detection , we analyzed the correlation between barcodes detected in the gene expression library and the enriched TaG-EM barcode library as a function of the purity of TaG-EM barcode detection for each cell  . For TaG-EM barcode detections where the most abundance barcode was a high percentage of the total barcode reads detected  , there was a high correlation between the barcode detected in the gene expression library and the enriched TaG-EM barcode library . 8% of cells with a TaG-EM barcode reliably detected , a very modest improvement over the gene expression library alone  , indicating that at least for this experiment , the main constraint is sufficient expression of the TaG-EM barcode and not detection . To identify TaG-EM barcodes in the combined data set , we counted a positive detection as any barcode either identified in the gene expression library or any barcode identified in the enriched library with a purity of >75% . In the case of conflicting barcode calls , we assigned the barcode that was detected directly in the gene expression library . Expression of the cell-type-specific barcodes showed more restricted patterns of expression among the cell clusters and were co-localized with known marker genes for these cell types  . For instance , TaG-EM barcode 6 , driven by the EB-Gal4 line , was expressed primarily in cells that were annotated as enteroblasts  and that expressed precursor cell markers such as esg  , klu  , and Notch pathway genes such as e  mbeta-HLH and e  m3-HLH  . TaG-EM barcode 4 expression , which was driven by the EC-Gal4 line , was seen primarily in a cluster that was annotated as enterocytes  and that expressed enterocyte markers such as the serine protease Jon99Ciii and other enterocyte marker genes such as the amylase , Amy-d  , but not the beta-Trypsin  gene  . Finally , expression of TaG-EM barcode 9 , which was expressed using the EE-Gal4 driver line , was observed in clusters annotated as enteroendocrine cells  and that also expressed enteroendocrine cell derived neuropeptide genes such as Dh31  and other enteroendocrine markers such as IA-2 , a tyrosine phosphatase involved in the secretion of insulin-like peptide  . Detailed characterization of the EE-Gal4 driver line indicated that ~80–85% of Prospero-positive enteroendocrine cells are labeled in the anterior and middle of the larval midgut , with a lower percentage  of Prospero-positive cells labeled in the posterior midgut  . As with the enterocyte labeling , and consistent with the Gal4 driver expression pattern , the EE-Gal4 expressed TaG-EM barcode 9 did not label all classes of enteroendocrine cells and other clusters of presumptive enteroendocrine cells expressing other neuropeptides such as Orcokinin , AstA , and AstC , or neuropeptide receptors such as CCHa2  were also observed . The EE-Gal4 driver uses Dh31 regulatory elements , so it is not surprising that the TaG-EM barcodes specifically labeled Dh31-positive enteroendocrine cells and this result further highlights the ability to target specific genetically defined cell types using TaG-EM based on in vivo cell labeling . Taken together , these results demonstrate that TaG-EM can be used to label specific cell populations that correlate with Gal4-driven expression patterns in vivo for subsequent identification in single-cell sequencing data . Here , we describe TaG-EM , a genetic barcoding strategy that enables novel capabilities in several different experimental contexts  . Analysis of structured pools of flies with defined inputs suggests that TaG-EM barcode measurements are highly accurate and reproducible , particularly in cases where multiple barcodes are used to label an experimental condition and averaged  . Sequencing-based TaG-EM measurements recapitulated more laborious , one-at-a-time measurements in a phototaxis assay , an age-dependent fecundity assay , and a gut motility assay , demonstrating that TaG-EM can be used to measure behavior or other phenotypes in multiplexed , pooled populations  . We excluded this poor performing barcode line from the fecundity tests; however , backcrossing is often used to bring reagents into a consistent genetic background for behavioral experiments and could also potentially be used to address behavior-specific issues with specific TaG-EM lines . In addition , other strategies such as averaging across multiple barcode lines  or permutation of barcode assignment across replicates could also mitigate such deficiencies . Currently , up to 176 conditions can be multiplexed in a single pooled experiment with existing TaG-EM lines , but because sequencing indices can be added after amplification in a separate indexing PCR step , many hundreds or even thousands of such experiments can be multiplexed in a single-sequencing run . While the utility of TaG-EM barcode-based quantification will vary based on the number of conditions being analyzed and the ease of quantifying the behavior or phenotype by other means , we demonstrate that TaG-EM can be employed to cost-effectively streamline labor-intensive assays and to quantify phenotypes with small effect sizes  . An additional benefit of multiplexed TaG-EM behavioral measurements is that the experimental conditions are effectively blinded as the multiplexed conditions are intermingled in a single assay . In addition , we show that TaG-EM barcodes can be expressed by tissue-specific Gal4 drivers and used to tag specific cell populations upstream of single-cell sequencing  . This capability will allow for positive identification of cell clusters in cell atlas projects and will facilitate multiplexing of single-cell sequencing experiments . However , one distinction between the two approaches is that RABID-Seq relies on stochastic viral infection of mammalian cells while TaG-EM allows reproducible targeting of defined cell populations allowing unambiguous cell identification and potentially allowing the same cell populations to be assessed at different timepoints or in the context of different experimental manipulations . One current limitation is that TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data . However , we also observed variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes that were all driven by the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver  . For single-cell RNA-Seq experiments , the cost savings of multiplexing is roughly the cost of a run divided by the number of independent lines multiplexed , plus labor savings by also being able to multiplex upstream flow cytometry , minus loss of unbarcoded cells . Our experiments indicated that for the specific drivers we tested TaG-EM barcodes are detected in around one quarter of the cells if relying on endogenous expression in the gene expression library , though this fraction was higher  if sequencing an enriched TaG-EM barcode library in parallel  . In the future , generation of additional TaG-EM lines will enable higher levels of multiplexing . In addition , while the original TaG-EM lines were made using a membrane-localized myr::GFP construct , variants that express GFP in other cell compartments such as the cytoplasm or nucleus could be constructed to enable increased expression levels or purification of nuclei . Nuclear labeling could also be achieved by co-expressing a nuclear GFP construct with existing TaG-EM lines in analogy to the use of hexameric GFP described above . In summary , combined with the large collections of Gal4 and split-Gal4 lines that have been established in Drosophila that enable precise targeting of a high proportion of cell types  , TaG-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing . Thus , TaG-EM provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms . pJFRC12-10XUAS-IVS-myr::GFP plasmid  was digested with the following reaction conditions: 5 µl pJFRC12-10XUAS-IVS-myr::GFP plasmid DNA  , 5 µl 10 x CutSmart buffer  , 1 µl PsiI enzyme  , 1 µl EcoRI enzyme  , and 38 µl nuclease-free water , were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr , followed by addition of 1 µl of CIP and incubation for an additional 30 min . DNA concentration was determined using a Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay  and the randomer barcode for each of the constructs was determined by Sanger sequencing using the following primers: 29 sequence verified constructs were normalized , pooled evenly , and injected as a pool into embryos  expressing PhiC31 integrase and the carrying the attP2 landing site  . The barcode sequence for each of the independent transgenic lines was determined by Sanger sequencing using the SV40_5 F and SV40_PostR primers . An additional 156 TaG-EM barcode lines were isolated and sequence verified as described in a separate publication  . The following primers were evaluated to amplify the TaG-EM barcodes upstream of NGS: Forward primer pool: four primers with frameshifting bases to increase library sequence diversity in initial sequencing cycles were normalized to 10 µM and pooled evenly to make a B2_3’F1_Nextera_0–6 primer pool: SV40_pre_R_nextera is designed to produce a shorter amplicon  and SV40-post_R_Nextera is designed to produce a longer amplicon  . Two different samples were tested: Set up the following PCR reactions: Male or female flies from TaG-EM barcode lines were pooled in either an even or staggered manner  . 2 of the protocol , cDNA amplification , 1 µl of TaG-EM spike-in primer  was added to the reaction to amplify cDNA with the TaG-EM barcode . Gene expression cDNA and TaG-EM cDNA were separated using a double-sided SPRIselect  bead clean up following 10x Genomics Single Cell 3’ Feature Barcode protocol , step 2 . Custom nested primers were used for enrichment of TaG-EM barcodes after cDNA creation using PCR . The following primers were tested  : After multiple optimization trials , the following steps yielded ~96% on-target reads for the TaG-EM library  .

Additional sequencing of the enriched TaG-EM library also done following Scenario 2 from the same protocol . Libraries for TaG-EM barcode analysis from structured pools or from phototaxis or oviposition experiments were denatured with NaOH and prepared for sequencing according to the protocols described in the Illumina MiSeq Denature and Dilute Libraries Guides .

         "Understanding the origins of novel , complex phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology . Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times . However , taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species , without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended . As a result , our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete . Here , we provide new data showing that , in contrast to previous studies , species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids . We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants , which are known sources of alkaloids . Thus , our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype . Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation . We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms . In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics , we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins . \n Complex phenotypes can evolve by leveraging phenotypic plasticity in existing traits with concerted change in developmental modules ( West-Eberhard , 2003 ) . However , the evolutionary trajectory that animals take to traverse an adaptive landscape from one phenotype to another may be difficult to reconstruct given that they often must cross or avoid adaptive valleys , which include phenotypes that are not always readily observed in populations ( e . g . Martin and Wainwright , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , phenotype diversity can help us unravel origins of novel traits and reveal the physiological trade-offs associated with their evolutionary trajectory ( Tarvin et al . , 2017 ) . Acquired chemical defenses , or the ability to sequester and use chemicals from the environment against predators or parasites , is one complex phenotype whose evolutionary history has proved difficult to characterize ( Berenbaum , 1995; Santos et al . , 2016 ) . Although human interest in poisonous plants and animals is old — dating back millennia ( Charitos et al . , 2022 ) — we have only recently begun to elucidate the specific mechanisms involved in acquired chemical defenses ( Beran and Petschenka , 2022 ) . This persisting gap in knowledge may be partly explained by a historical lack of integration between systems biology and pharmacology ( Rostami-Hodjegan , 2012 ) . Here , we incorporate ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs ( Anura: Dendrobatidae ) into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in poison frogs and more generally in other animals . In the following text , we use the terms alkaloid and toxin interchangeably , although the toxicity of each poison frog alkaloid is not always known or very straightforward ( Lawrence et al . , 2023 ) . Similarly , for simplicity we broadly bin species as defended ( high alkaloid content ) or undefended ( low or zero alkaloid content ) , although little information exists regarding the defensive efficacy of specific alkaloids . In this context , we use the term alkaloid to refer to compounds with nitrogen-containing rings , specifically the subset of lipophilic alkaloids representing classes previously described in anuran integument , for example ‘N-methyldecahydroquinolines’ or ‘lehmizidines’ ( e . g . Daly et al . , 2009; Daly et al . , 2005 ) . In the 1980s , Toft characterized several types of foraging behaviors in neotropical frogs and found that active foraging for ants was common in poisonous frogs ( Dendrobatidae and Bufonidae ) , while sit-and-wait predation on larger prey was common in non-poisonous species ( Toft , 1981; Toft , 1980 ) . Toft hypothesized that chemical defenses protected poisonous species from the greater predation risk incurred by active foraging . At the time , it was thought that poisonous dendrobatids synthesized their own alkaloids ( the biosynthetic hypothesis; reviewed by Saporito et al . , 2009 ) , so differences in diet were not considered mechanistically relevant to differences in levels of chemical defense . However , Daly et al . , 1994a later demonstrated that chemically defended dendrobatid frogs obtained alkaloids from their diet . This dietary hypothesis led researchers to reevaluate the evolutionary importance of active foraging and hypothesize that specialization on ants promoted the evolution of chemical defense in Dendrobatidae ( Caldwell , 1996 ) . Later , a more detailed phylogenetic analysis of Dendrobatidae revealed that chemical defense and diet specialization co-evolved independently several times ( Santos et al . , 2003 ) . The new information helped generate the diet-toxicity hypothesis , which posits that shifts from a generalist to a specialist diet are correlated with origins of alkaloid uptake ( Darst et al . , 2005; Santos and Cannatella , 2011 ) . Since then , many studies have focused on the diet of poison frogs in an effort to directly connect diet with chemical defense in specific species ( e . g . McGugan et al . , 2016; Osorio et al . , 2015; Sanches et al . , 2023; Sánchez-Loja et al . , 2024 ) and to identify sources of poison frog alkaloids ( e . g . Saporito et al . , 2007b; Saporito et al . , 2004 ) . In general , most of the studies of poison-frog ecology since the 1990s emphasize or assume that diet is a primary determinant of defense . Although in the 1990s Daly and his colleagues proposed that an alkaloid uptake system was present in the ancestor of Dendrobatidae and is overexpressed in aposematic species ( Daly , 1998; Daly et al . , 1994b; Saporito et al . , 2009 ) , no details about this purported system were given , and little focus was placed on the physiological processes of alkaloid sequestration in poison frogs for nearly 20 years . Santos et al . , 2016 noted that the study of acquired chemical defenses is ‘essentially a study in pharmacokinetics’ . Pharmacokinetics ( or toxicokinetics , for toxins; Spurgeon et al . , 2020 ) is the study of how bioactive compounds are processed by animals . Organismal processes are often binned into four categories together known as ADME , which stands for Absorption , or movement into the bloodstream , Distribution , or movement into and out of body compartments , Metabolism , or biotransformation of the compound , and Excretion , or elimination from the body ( Ruiz-Garcia et al . , 2008 ) . Herein we use similar terms that are more directly relevant to the study of acquired chemical defenses: toxin intake , or the amount of toxin consumed; toxin elimination , or the metabolic detoxification and/or elimination of toxins from the body ( equivalent to Metabolism +Excretion ) ; toxin sequestration , or the transport and storage of toxins to a specific location such as the skin ( a modified version of Distribution ) ; and toxin accumulation , or the retention of toxins in an animal , whether or not it is by sequestration processes . Applying ideas from pharmacokinetics to acquired chemical defenses leads us to propose a four-phase evolutionary model , which we call the passive-accumulation hypothesis: ( 1 ) consistent exposure to a toxic compound; ( 2 ) prior existence or evolution of some resistance to the toxin; ( 3 ) change in the elimination rate of the compound that leads to its prolonged retention , hereafter passive accumulation; and ( 4 ) adaptation of molecular pathways to transport and store the compound in a specific location , hereafter sequestration , which results in the chemical defense phenotype . Phases 3 and 4 may both select for increased toxin resistance , initiating a positive feedback loop that could intensify chemical defense and resistance over time . Note that while we focus on the physiological processes underlying toxin resistance and sequestration , other selection pressures including predators may influence these patterns ( Other factors that may shape the evolution of acquired chemical defenses ) . Savitzky et al . , 2012 defined ‘sequestration’ as ‘the evolved retention within tissues of specific compounds , not normally retained in the ancestors of the taxon in question , which confers a selective advantage through one or more particular functions’ . We define passive accumulation as a type of toxin accumulation that is temporary and results from the delay between toxin intake and elimination; an example would be the temporary accumulation then clearance of ibuprofen in blood plasma in humans following ingestion ( Albert and Gernaat , 1984 ) . We differentiate passive accumulation from sequestration , a term that we argue implies the existence of a derived form of a transport or storage mechanism absent in the ancestor of the taxon , which would permit greater levels of and more long-term toxin accumulation than passive accumulation . In other systems such as insects , mechanisms of sequestration are sometimes described as passive ( occurring by diffusion ) or active ( energy-consuming; Petschenka and Agrawal , 2016 ) . Given the general lack of data regarding the mechanisms underlying sequestration in frogs , we refrain from applying these modifiers to the sequestration term . To develop and refine this hypothesis , we gathered diet and toxin data from a broad selection of aposematic and inconspicuously colored poison-frog species . Approximately 100 of the 345 dendrobatid poison-frog species ( AmphibiaWeb , 2023 ) fall into three conspicuously colored and alkaloid-sequestering ( aposematic ) clades: Ameerega , Epipedobates , and Dendrobatinae . The other 245 species compose several other primarily inconspicuously colored clades that for the most part have been assumed to lack alkaloid defenses: that is , all Aromobatinae ( e . g . Allobates , Rheobates , Anomaloglossus , and Aromobates ) , all Hyloxalinae ( Ectopoglossus , Hyloxalus , Paruwrobates ) , and some Colostethinae ( Colostethus , Silverstoneia , Leucostethus; Figure 1 ) . According to the phylogenetic placement of defended and undefended species within Dendrobatidae , poison frogs have evolved sequestration of lipophilic alkaloids from consumed arthropods at least three times ( Santos et al . , 2014; Santos et al . , 2003 ) , making them a suitable group to study complex phenotypic transitions like the evolution of chemical defense . In total , we surveyed 104 animals representing 32 species of Neotropical frogs including 28 dendrobatid species , 2 bufonids , 1 leptodactylid , and 1 eleutherodactylid ( see Methods ) . Each of the major undefended clades in Dendrobatidae ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) is represented in our dataset , with a total of 14 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed . Next , we review old and new evidence from poison frogs in the context of the four-phase model ( Phases 1 and 2: Consistent exposure to toxins may select for resistance in poison frog and Phases 3 and 4: Evidence for passive accumulation and sequestration in poison frogs ) . Then we describe major predictions that need further testing to validate and/or revise the proposed model ( Predictions arising from the passive-accumulation hypothesis ) . Finally , we discuss other factors that might influence the evolution of chemical defenses ( Other factors that may shape the evolution of acquired chemical defenses ) , the passive accumulation phenotype in a broader evolutionary context ( The passive-accumulation phenotype in a broader evolutionary context ) , and possible limitations of this study ( Limitations ) . Overall , we propose that further integrating ideas from pharmacokinetics into studies of acquired chemical defenses will lead to new insight in the field , with clear applications to human and ecosystem health . In that vein , we suggest that evolutionary changes in toxin resistance and metabolism are critical physiological shifts that facilitate origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals . \n Several of the lipophilic alkaloids found in dendrobatid frogs have been traced to arthropod sources , specifically mites ( Saporito et al . , 2007b ) , ants ( Saporito et al . , 2004 ) , and beetles ( Dumbacher et al . , 2004 ) , although the extent to which such arthropod prey vary in alkaloid diversity and quantity remains relatively unstudied . Regardless , broad-scale shifts in diet content towards a higher proportion of ants and mites have been hypothesized to play an important role in the origin of chemical defense in poison frogs ( Darst et al . , 2005; Santos and Cannatella , 2011 ) . We quantified gut contents for 32 species of Neotropical frogs . Both undefended and defended dendrobatid species consume a large proportion of ants and mites ( Figure 2; Supplementary file 1 ) . Although the defended dendrobatid clades tend to consume proportionally more ants and mites , as in other studies , the undefended lineages do consume a high proportion of ants and mites . Other data support this general pattern: ants and mites respectively constituted up to 51% and 60% of the stomach contents of the undefended dendrobatids Allobates talamancae ( Mebs et al . , 2018 ) and Hyloxalus sauli ( Darst et al . , 2005 ) . Ants and mites compose nearly 50% of the arthropods ( 36% and 10% , respectively ) found in the Silverstoneia flotator stomachs we analyzed ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Sympatric populations of the undefended Hyloxalus awa and defended Epipedobates espinosai ( formerly E . darwinwallacei López-Hervas et al . , 2024 ) are both diet specialized , with the former consuming mostly ants and beetles and the latter consuming mostly mites and springtails ( Sánchez-Loja et al . , 2024 ) . In a lab experiment , the defended species Dendrobates tinctorius preferred fruit fly larvae over ants when given the choice ( Moskowitz et al . , 2022b ) , suggesting that even in defended species , consumption of possible alkaloid-containing prey is not necessarily a preference . Another study revealed that Oophaga sylvatica alkaloid quantity is inversely correlated with numbers of consumed ants and mites; however , this species consumed more mites and ants than sympatric Hyloxalus elachyhistus ( Moskowitz et al . , 2022a ) . The few bufonids that we assessed also show a high proportion of ants and mites in their diet ( Figure 2 ) . Thus , if we assume that many ants and mites contain alkaloids , it is likely that most if not all dendrobatids and their most recent common ancestors have long been exposed to toxins through their diet . Few if any experiments have been done to quantify the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs . Given the broad diversity of alkaloid classes found in poison frogs ( Daly et al . , 2005 ) , it is very difficult to predict or quantify all possible types or variations of alkaloid resistance that exist across species , or in their ancestors . In animals , the general mechanisms of toxin resistance are avoidance , metabolism , and target modification ( Tarvin et al . , 2023 ) . If an animal does not or cannot avoid toxin exposure , it will need to survive exposure using toxin metabolism or target modification mechanisms such as biotransformation , elimination , alternative targets , and target-site resistance ( see Tarvin et al . , 2023 for more details ) . Given their diet , dendrobatids clearly do not completely avoid toxin exposure , and thus they are likely to survive exposure using some manner of toxin metabolism or target modification . Indeed , target-site resistance to some alkaloids evolved in several defended dendrobatid clades and in some undefended species ( Tarvin et al . , 2017; Tarvin et al . , 2016 ) . A few defended species have alternative target mechanisms including binding proteins like alpha-binding globulin ( Alvarez-Buylla et al . , 2023 ) and saxiphilin ( Abderemane-Ali et al . , 2021 ) that might prevent alkaloids from accessing their molecular targets ( e . g . ion channels ) . Other mechanisms may also exist . For example , poison frogs may biotransform alkaloids into less toxic forms until they can be eliminated from the body , for example using cytochrome p450s ( Caty et al . , 2019 ) . The mechanism of resistance employed might differ between undefended and defended species , but more research is necessary to understand these patterns . Although more data are necessary to understand the evolution of toxin resistance in dendrobatids ( Coleman and Cannatella , 2024 ) , existing data suggest that all or nearly all dendrobatids are exposed to alkaloids ( Figure 2 ) and that alkaloid resistance varies among lineages . To understand the major evolutionary transition from consuming to sequestering toxins , it is essential to characterize the metabolism and sequestration of alkaloids in defended and undefended dendrobatid lineages ( Gonzalez and Carazzone , 2023 ) . However , many of the undefended lineages have not been carefully evaluated for the presence or absence of chemical defense . By reviewing existing data , we found that only 31 of the 245 inconspicuous poison frog species described to date AmphibiaWeb , 2023 have been assessed for toxins , sometimes using methods that would not necessarily detect lipophilic alkaloids ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Further , prior studies have sometimes misinterpreted or not fully incorporated these data ( Supplementary file 2 , and see below ) . Our review and reassessment of these studies suggest that at least 11 undefended species might have lipophilic alkaloids: Allobates femoralis , Allobates kingsburyi , Allobates zaparo , Colostethus ucumari , H . elachyhistus , Hyloxalus nexipus , Hyloxalus vertebralis , Hyloxalus yasuni , Leucostethus fugax , Paruwrobates erythromos , and Silverstoneia punctiventris ( Daly et al . , 1987; Darst et al . , 2005; Gonzalez et al . , 2021; Grant , 2007; Moskowitz et al . , 2022a; Santos and Cannatella , 2011 ) . We tested for possible alkaloid presence in additional aposematic and inconspicuously colored poison-frog lineages . Using Gas-Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry ( GC-MS ) , we surveyed 89 animals representing 30 species of Neotropical frogs including 27 dendrobatid species , 1 leptodactylid , and 2 bufonids ( Figure 2 ) . We also performed a highly sensitive , untargeted analysis —ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography heated-electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry ( UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS ) — of a dendrobatid from an undefended clade ( S . flotator; 12 individuals ) and a species of eleutherodactylid ( Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides; 3 individuals ) , in which alkaloid diversities and types , but not quantities , were assessed . Each of the major undefended clades in Dendrobatidae ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) is represented in our dataset with a total of 13 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed with GC-MS and 1 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed with UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS . As far as we are aware , we provide alkaloid data for the first time for six undefended dendrobatid species ( Rheobates palmatus , Allobates juanii , Hyloxalus shuar , Hyloxalus sp . Agua Azul , Silverstoneia aff . gutturalis , and Silverstoneia erasmios ) and one defended species ( Epipedobates currulao ) . We also provide the first alkaloid data for the non-dendrobatids Amazophrynella siona , El . cystignathoides , and Lithodytes lineatus ( but see de Lima Barros et al . , 2016 ) . Because chemical standards for most poison frog alkaloids do not exist , it is not possible to provide absolute quantification of alkaloids . Reported values for GC-MS data are in units of integrated area , which do not directly correspond to alkaloid quantity because of differences in ion yield . Nevertheless , qualitative comparisons of integrated areas can provide insight into how species differ in degrees of magnitude . Overall , we detected alkaloids in skins from 13 of the 14 undefended dendrobatid species included in our study , although often with less diversity and relatively lower quantities than in defended lineages ( Figure 2 , Table 1 , Supplementary file 3 , Supplementary file 4 ) . The pervasiveness of low alkaloid levels in undefended dendrobatid lineages ( Aromobatinae , Hyloxalinae , some species of Colostethinae ) contrasts with the mixed or opposing evidence from previous analyses ( Supplementary file 2 ) . In addition , our GC-MS assessment revealed substantially higher diversities of alkaloids in defended dendrobatid species than previously reported ( Cipriani and Rivera , 2009; Daly et al . , 1987; Lawrence et al . , 2023; Moskowitz et al . , 2022a , ) , and expands knowledge on major classes of alkaloids within genera . The large number of structures that we identified is in part due to the way we reviewed GC-MS data: in addition to searching for alkaloids with known fragmentation patterns , we also searched for anything that could qualify as an alkaloid mass spectrometrically but that may not match a previously known structure in a reference database . Similarly , the analysis of UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS data was untargeted , and thus enables a broader survey of chemistry compared to that from prior GC-MS studies . Structural annotations in our UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS analysis were made using CANOPUS , a deep neural network that is able to classify unknown metabolites based on MS/MS fragmentation patterns , with 99 . 7% accuracy in cross-validation ( Dührkop et al . , 2021 ) . Although contamination across samples is possible , it is unlikely to invalidate the identification of alkaloids in undefended species based on the following . ( 1 ) At several sites , we only sampled undefended species , and these individuals were found to contain alkaloids ( e . g . Las Brisas: R . palmatus; El Valle: S . aff . gutturalis; Santa Maria: H . sp . Agua Azul ) ; that is these cannot possibly have come from contamination by defended species . ( 2 ) At one site where we collected both undefended and defended species , the undefended species shows no alkaloids ( Lita: Hyloxalus toachi ) ; i . e . , the preparation of both types does not imply cross-contamination of samples . ( 3 ) At two sites where the undefended species were prepared on a different day from the defended species ( Valle Hermoso: H . awa and Epipedobates boulengeri; Canelos: L . fugax and Ameerega hahneli ) and could not have been cross-contaminated , the undefended species still show evidence of alkaloids . ( 4 ) All chromatograms in the GC-MS sequence and integration data were inspected manually . Peaks with low areas or following samples with high areas and subject to carryover were excluded from further analysis . ( 5 ) Data collected by a different team and analyzed with different methods also identify alkaloids in an undefended dendrobatid ( S . flotator ) from Panama . Data from this and other studies point to the ubiquity of mites and ants in nearly all dendrobatid diets , and possibly more generally in other leaf-litter dwelling frogs ( Figure 2 ) . This finding in concert with the detection of low levels of alkaloids in the lineages that putatively lack chemical defenses leads us to hypothesize that dietary shifts are not sufficient to explain the presence or absence of the chemical defense phenotype within Dendrobatidae or possibly in other families ( Bufonidae ) . The total amount of alkaloids accumulated is a result of multiple processes including toxin intake , elimination , and sequestration ( Figure 3 ) — not just intake alone . For example , dendrobatid species vary in their ability to eliminate alkaloids . Some appear to lack specific transport and storage mechanisms for consumed alkaloids ( ‘sequestration’ ) , yet they have detectable levels of alkaloids in their skin; we refer to this phenotype as passive accumulation and suggest that it is an evolutionary intermediate between toxin consumption ( with no sequestration ) and sequestration ( Figure 3 ) . We predict that the ancestral state of poison frogs and potentially other clades with alkaloid-sequestering species ( e . g . Bufonidae: Melanophryniscus , Eleutherodactylidae: Eleutherodactylus , and Mantellidae: Mantella ) is alkaloid consumption and low levels of alkaloid resistance , accompanied by passive alkaloid accumulation ( e . g . see Figures 1 and 3 ) . Alternatively , passive accumulation may have arisen in an even earlier ancestor . That we detected alkaloids in two genera of bufonid toads could reflect a single origin of passive accumulation in the ancestor of the clade that includes Dendrobatidae and its sister group ( the clade comprised of the Terranana [including Eleutherodactylidae] , Bufonidae , Leptodactylidae , and Odontophrynidae; AmphibiaWeb , 2023; Blackburn and Wake , 2011; Feng et al . , 2017; Streicher et al . , 2018; Yuan et al . , 2019 ) . Further sampling for alkaloids within Eleutherodactylidae and Leptodactylidae could reveal whether passive accumulation has persisted in these clades . Discriminating a single origin — no matter the timing — from multiple ones would require more extensive alkaloid surveys , as we only assessed four non-dendrobatid species . Here , we propose and discuss three additional predictions arising from the passive-accumulation hypothesis that would help further evaluate the validity of a four-phase model . Many animals occasionally or frequently consume toxins , and a multitude have evolved toxin resistance . Some invertebrate pests resist pesticides ( Andreev et al . , 1999; Chiu et al . , 2008; Daborn et al . , 2002; Ffrench-Constant , 2013 ) , many insect herbivores resist plant toxins ( Agrawal et al . , 2012; Dobler et al . , 2011 ) , some predators resist toxic prey ( Arbuckle et al . , 2017 ) , and many animals resist environmental pollutants ( Whitehead et al . , 2017 ) . Our model predicts that some or many of these may be on their way towards evolving acquired chemical defenses . Yet , not all toxin-exposed or toxin-resistant species inevitably evolve chemical defenses , presumably because the ecological context or physiology that favors accumulation is absent or because resisting and accumulating toxins is too costly . Acquired chemical defenses usually evolve within the context of a tri-trophic interaction: animals in the middle of the food web accumulate toxins from their prey , and possible predators or parasites are deterred by the accumulated toxin ( Agrawal , 2000 ) . This phenomenon is referred to as enemy-free space , i . e . , escape from parasitism or predation ( Jeffries and Lawton , 1984 ) . If there is no predator or parasite present to exert selection on a toxin-consuming animal , there may be no benefit for the animal to accumulate the toxins . Furthermore , some chemicals may not be able to be accumulated because of how they interact with the physiology of an animal ( e . g . Mebs et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , the evolution of chemical defenses may be constrained by the specific chemicals present in an ecosystem , the existing trophic interactions among species , and the physiology of predators and parasites in relation to the chemicals in question . Origins of chemical defenses are also shaped by the cost of resisting and accumulating toxins , which can change over evolutionary time as animals adapt to novel relationships with toxins . In poison frogs and other toxin-accumulating animals , it is common to observe a few amino acid substitutions in ion channels that provide target-site resistance to alkaloids but adversely affect the function of the protein; these substitutions are often accompanied by additional , compensatory substitutions that restore protein function without affecting resistance ( Karageorgi et al . , 2019; Mohammadi et al . , 2021; Reid et al . , 2016; Tarvin et al . , 2017; Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . It is rare but possible to observe species that lack ( known ) compensatory substitutions ( Tarvin et al . , 2017 ) , suggesting that species are under strong selection to overcome some costs of target-site resistance . In one species of garter snake ( Thamnophis sirtalis ) , the cost of target-site resistance in a voltage-gated sodium channel is not completely offset as animals with target-site resistance have reduced crawl speeds ( Hague et al . , 2018 ) . In some insects , resistance to insecticides comes with a cost in fecundity or survival ( Kliot and Ghanim , 2012 ) . For example , the aphid Aphis nerii experiences trade-offs between population growth and defense effectiveness ( Züst et al . , 2018 ) . As far as we are aware , the possible lifetime fitness costs ( e . g . in reproductive success ) of alkaloid consumption in dendrobatids have not been measured . Once chemical defenses evolve , they are often further shaped by co-evolution between the defended prey and their predators ( Brodie and Brodie , 1990; Bucciarelli et al . , 2022 ) , which can result in the appearance of visual or morphological signals , mimicry , and even the loss of defenses in the prey if the predator evolves sufficient resistance ( Brodie and Brodie , 1991; Brown and Trigo , 1994; Crothers et al . , 2016 ) . These additional ecological factors in turn shape the physiology of an animal in ways that may further promote evolutionary innovation ( Loeffler-Henry et al . , 2023; Przeczek et al . , 2008; Santos et al . , 2014 ) . In sum , various factors interact in a dynamic equilibrium over short and long timeframes to shape chemical defenses . Passive accumulation of toxins is not a novel concept , as it has been discussed previously in terms of self-medication ( Clayton and Wolfe , 1993; Singer et al . , 2009 ) and bioaccumulation ( e . g . of environmental pollutants; Butler , 1978; Spurgeon et al . , 2020; Streit , 1992 ) , and we propose that it is also conceptually analogous to some medical treatments in humans such as chemotherapy . Any organism that consumes something toxic might simultaneously suffer from toxin exposure yet benefit from the compound’s effect on disease , infection , parasites , or predators . For example , in the presence of parasitoids , Drosophila suzukii flies preferentially lay their eggs on the insecticide atropine , which protects them from being parasitized but prolongs development ( Poyet et al . , 2017 ) . Mechanisms that likely underlie passive accumulation may also be analogous to key organismal functions ( Duffey , 1980 ) . For example , humans accumulate vitamin E in the liver ( Violet et al . , 2020 ) and use a transfer protein abundant in liver cells to shuttle the vitamin into the plasma where it becomes bioavailable ( Arita et al . , 1995 ) . The transition from passive accumulation to sequestration in poison frogs may similarly rely on the use of proteins that bind to and transport alkaloids ( Alvarez-Buylla et al . , 2023 ) . If toxin accumulation is both low-cost and beneficial , slow toxin elimination rates could evolve quite readily , resulting in passive accumulation . Two recent studies support the idea that some toxin resistance permits toxin intake and results in passive accumulation . In one , nicotine-resistant Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies that were fed nicotine accumulated measurable amounts of the toxin in their bodies , more than nicotine-sensitive flies ( Douglas et al . , 2022 ) . In another study , ouabain-resistant D . melanogaster flies that were fed ouabain accumulated measurable amounts of ouabain in their bodies , more than ouabain-sensitive flies ( Karageorgi et al . , 2019 ) . In a another example , the sawfly Athalia rosae shows constant turnover of its glucosinolate toxins , suggesting that these insects cannot effectively store glucosinolates , yet their metabolic clearing is inefficient enough that they still maintain a high level of toxins in the hemolymph ( Müller and Wittstock , 2005 ) . It is conceivable , then , that in some cases , passive accumulation could result in chemical defense through a mechanism that enables high net toxin intake , followed by evasion of elimination mechanisms , passive entry into the bloodstream , and diffusion into other tissues . Are these cases of sequestration ? Under our definition they are not , given that these species do not actively transport and store these compounds , as far as we know . Rather , these organisms merely fail to efficiently metabolize and eliminate these compounds , leading to their temporary diffusion in tissues and providing a transient benefit against parasites or predators . Evidence for this passive-accumulation phenotype as an intermediate stage on the path towards toxin sequestration is scarce , but passive accumulation is a pervasive pattern in studies of ecological toxicology and may be more common in lineages that evolved toxin sequestration than we currently know . Our study presents a novel alkaloid dataset for dendrobatid frogs and some relatives , yet it is limited in the following ways . For some species we only sampled one or two individuals , which may paint an incomplete picture of toxin diversity , toxin quantity , and diet in the group . Poison frogs vary substantially over time , space , and seasons in their alkaloid profiles and diets ( Agudelo-Cantero et al . , 2015; Saporito et al . , 2007a ) , yet we did not conduct serial sampling over a broad geographic range for each species . Standards are unavailable for most frog alkaloids and thus we could not measure absolute quantity . Relative quantitation of GC-MS data was performed based on integration of the extracted ion chromatogram of the base peak for each alkaloid for maximum sensitivity and selectivity . The nature of these data means that qualitative comparisons may be meaningful but quantitative comparisons across alkaloid structures could be misleading , especially given our small sample sizes for some species . Finally , batrachotoxin and tetrodotoxin are too heavy to study using GC-MS; we cannot exclude the possibility that they occur in the sampled species . The large-scale evolutionary transition from consuming to sequestering toxins has occurred in a plethora of invertebrates ( Duffey , 1980 ) and vertebrates ( Savitzky et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we provide new evidence showing that undefended poison frogs and frogs in a closely related family ( Bufonidae ) contain measurable amounts of alkaloids , and we confirm that they consume some amount of toxic arthropod prey . We propose that passive accumulation of consumed alkaloids is an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae , and possibly in related taxa , and that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense . Future studies of the toxicokinetics of alkaloids in different tissues of both defended and undefended poison frogs will shed light on these putative intermediate evolutionary steps . In turn , insights from poison frog physiology will provide a novel perspective for the development of human therapeutics , which modulate some of the same pharmacokinetic processes . \n Silverstoneia flotator and El . cystignathoides were collected and euthanized with benzocaine in 2022 in Gamboa , Panama ( 9 . 1373 , –79 . 723183 ) and in 2024 in Austin , Texas , USA ( 30 . 285 , –97 . 736 and 30 . 292487 , –97 . 737874 ) , respectively . Dorsal and ventral skins were removed and placed separately in ~1 mL MeOH in 1-dram glass vials for UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS analyses ( see below ) . All other species were collected in 2014 and euthanized with an overdose of lidocaine . Whole skins were removed and placed in ~1 mL MeOH in glass vials with PTFE-lined caps . Stomachs of all species were removed and placed in 95% ethanol . Instruments and dissection surfaces were cleaned with 95% ethanol between dissections . Species were selected with the goal of broad sampling of evolutionary lineages in Dendrobatidae; our protocols followed the ARRIVE guidelines where applicable ( Kilkenny et al . , 2010 ) . The number of individuals sampled per species was opportunistic . For each Epipedobates species , a subset of total samples available were randomly selected to be included; the full dataset will be published in another paper focused on variation within the genus . For samples from Ecuador and Colombia , a 100 μL aliquot of the MeOH was sampled from each vial and transferred to a 200 μL limited volume insert and analyzed directly by GC-MS . The system used was a Thermo AS-3000 autosampler interfaced to a Trace GC Ultra interfaced to an iTQ 1100 ion trap mass spectrometer autotuned with FC-43 ( PFTBA ) operating in positive ion mode . AS conditions were as follows: 2 pre-wash cycles of 5 μL MeOH , then 3 plunger strokes and withdrawal of 1 . 00 μL sample with 1 μL air gap , injection with no pre- or post-injection dwell followed by 3 post wash cycles of 5 μL MeOH . GC conditions were as follows: splitless injection , splitless time 1 . 00 min with surge ( 200 kPa for 0 . 70 min , to sharpen early peaks ) , split flow 50 mL/min; injector temperature 250°C , oven temperature program 100 °C for 1 min , then ramped at 10 °C/min to 280 °C and held 10 min; transfer line temperature 300 °C . MS conditions were as follows: for electron ionization ( EI ) , collection mode profile , 1 microscan , 25 μsec max ion time , range 35–650 μ , source temperature 250 °C , solvent delay 3 . 00 min , source voltage 70 eV; for chemical ionization ( CI ) , reagent gas NH3 ( 1 . 8 mL/min ) . Samples for CI were run in ddMS2 mode ( 3 precursor ions ) with 1 microscan , 50ms max ion time , 0 . 450 μ precursor width and dynamic exclusion duration 0 . 2 min . EI spectra were manually compared with published data ( Daly et al . , 2005; Daly et al . , 1999; Daly et al . , 1978 ) to identify class and likely ID . A set of known standards was run to give accurate retention times across the range of alkaloids and normalized to literature data using linear regression . Sample retention times were then normalized , and molecular weights were obtained from CI MS1 spectra . These were then directly compared to archival Daly GC-MS data where possible . CI MS2 spectra were also used where possible to confirm functional groups such as alcohols by loss of water , etc . Kovats retention indexes ( semi-standard nonpolar ) are also provided based on retention times and published indexes for background silicone impurities . Accuracy of index assignments was confirmed based on fatty acid methyl esters from skin lipids present in extracts . Epibatidine coelutes with the lipid methyl palmitoleate and the latter caused a number of false positives in the GC-MS data . We thus reviewed LC-HRMS data at the known elution time relative to a known standard . Epibatidine was only found in one sample in trace quantities and is marked as such . Samples from Panama and Texas were extracted on separate occasions , then filtered and run in tandem with UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS , following an untargeted metabolomics protocol , with conditions optimized specifically for retention and subsequent identification of alkaloids ( Sedio et al . , 2021 ) . Briefly , for extraction , methanol was evaporated and skins were homogenized with stainless steel beads in a TissueLyser II ( QIAGEN Sciences , Germantown , MD , USA ) and resuspended in 1800 μL of extraction solvent ( 9:1 MeOH:H2O ) . Samples were then extracted for 3 hr at 4 °C in a ThermoMixer ( Eppendorf US , Enfield , CT , USA ) , followed by evaporation of the methanol component with a SpeedVac concentrator ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Next , samples were freeze-dried with a lyophilizer overnight and resuspended in 500 μL extraction solvent . Resuspended extracts were then filtered and diluted 1:7 in 100% MeOH . The metabolomic extracts were run on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ( Waltham , MA , United States ) Vanquish Horizon Duo UHPLC system with an Accucore C18 column with 150 mm length , 2 . 1 mm internal diameter , and 2 . 6 μm particle size , and a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer . The instrumental methods ( e . g . the separation of metabolites by UHPLC , the volumes of buffers and their use in solvent gradients , and the use of heated electrospray ionization [HESI] run in positive ion mode with full-scan MS1 and data-dependent acquisition of MS2 [dd-MS2] ) were identical to those described by Sedio et al . , 2021 . A positive reference of 1 µg/µL≥98% ( ± ) -epibatidine dihydrochloride hydrate ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was included in the run , but injected last in the instrument so as to avoid possible carryover in the column . Following UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS , chromatographic data were processed using MZmine 3 ( v3 . 9 . 0; Schmid et al . , 2023 ) , applying a stringent MS1 noise threshold parameter >100 , 000 used by other workers ( e . g . Sedio et al . , 2021 ) . So as to avoid additions of false positive metabolite observations , we did not use a gap filling algorithm , a step often used in analysis of chemically homogeneous datasets to backfill overlooked metabolite occurrences . MZmine 3 assigns chromatographic features to putative compounds based on mass-to-charge ( m/z ) ratio and retention time . MZmine 3 feature tables and MS2 data were then uploaded to the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking ( GNPS ) platform ( Wang et al . , 2016 ) for Feature-Based Molecular Networking ( Nothias et al . , 2020 ) . We used SIRIUS v5 . 8 . 6 ( Dührkop et al . , 2019 ) and CSI:FingerID ( Dührkop et al . , 2015 ) to infer molecular formulae and predict structures including the elements H , C , N , O , P , and S . CANOPUS was used to classify metabolites ( Dührkop et al . , 2021 ) , following the ClassyFire ( Djoumbou Feunang et al . , 2016 ) and NPClassifier molecular taxonomies ( Kim et al . , 2021 ) . Only compounds assigned to the alkaloid pathway with an NPClassifier pathway probability score >99% were retained in the feature table , which was generated in R v4 . 2 . 2 ( R Development Core Team , 2023 ) At >99% confidence , epibatidine was detected in three S . flotator skin samples . Its presence was confirmed by manual inspection; the retention time , peak shape , isotope pattern and MS2 are consistent with the epibatidine standard . We note that epibatidine was only abundant enough in one of the three samples to render MS2 fragments . With respect to the compounds exclusive to the positive reference sample ( i . e . not present in the frog skins ) , at >99% confidence , the algorithms implemented in SIRIUS also predicted annotations consistent with an epibatidine alkaloid for a feature only detected in the positive reference sample , at the levels of most specific class ( ‘epibatidine analogues’: ClassyFire ) and class and superclass ( ‘pyridine alkaloids’' and ‘nicotinic acid alkaloids’: NPClassifier ) . The m/z ratio and structural prediction for this feature are consistent with the epibatidine homolog ‘homoepibatidine’ ( Supplementary file 6 ) . However , this annotation seems at odds with the true identity of the feature ( the retention time is at 0 . 5 min , the approximate void volume with the highly polar compounds , and the isotope pattern is not correct for Cl , matching better with silicon ) . Instead , the feature may represent a silicone derivative that , based on results from multiple runs of the instrument ( unpublished ) , we suspect could be an impurity consistently co-occurring with and mistaken for homoepibatidine . In another run , we recovered a feature exclusive to the positive reference sample with annotations identical at all levels to those for our ‘homoepibatidine’ feature , but with epibatidine’s expected m/z ratio ( ~209 ) and structure ( SMILES ) . In the run we publish here , what is likely this same feature ( with an m/z ratio of ~209 and annotated as ( +/- ) -epibatidine by GNPS ) was also recovered at the 99% confidence level . Assuming this feature is our positive reference — ( +/- ) -epibatidine — the molecule was annotated as expected at class and superclass levels ( ‘pyridine alkaloids’' and ‘nicotinic acid alkaloids’ , respectively ) but annotated incorrectly at the level of most specific class ( as a ‘pyrimidinethione’ ) . Our results suggest that SIRIUS sometimes correctly annotates at all pathway levels our ( +/- ) -epibatidine positive reference . Stomach contents were inspected under a stereomicroscope and all prey items identified to order ( or family , in the case of Formicidae ) . Given the low sample sizes in many individuals , we did not conduct statistical comparisons of diet composition across species . We summarized and plotted data from Ecuadorian and Colombian samples in R v4 . 3 . 1 ( R Development Core Team , 2023 ) using the packages ggplot2 ( Wickham , 2016 ) , cowplot v1 . 1 . 1 ( Wilke , 2020 ) , and dplyr v1 . 1 . 2 ( Wickham et al . , 2023 ) . The UHPLC-HESI-MSMS pipeline used on the samples from Panama and Texas allows for higher sensitivity to detect a broader array of compounds compared to our GC-MS methods but has lower retention-time resolution and produces less reliable structural predictions . Furthermore , due to the lack of liquid-chromatography-derived references for poison-frog alkaloids , precise alkaloid annotations from the UHPLC-HESI-MSMS dataset could not be obtained . Therefore , the UHPLC-HESI-MSMS and GC-MS datasets are not directly comparable , and UHPLC-HESI-MSMS data are not included in Figure 2 . Phylogenies were subsetted from Wan et al . , 2023 using ape v5 . 7 . 1 ( Paradis and Schliep , 2019 ) and phytools v1 . 9 . 16 ( Revell , 2012 ) . Co-eluting compounds in the GC-MS and having the same base peak could not be discerned with the parameters we used in the Xcalibur processing method , so we averaged their quantities across the co-eluting compounds . Corrections for mass were not included; we instead opted to provide data from full skins . No AI or AI-assisted technologies were used in the preparation of this manuscript .",

         "Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times . However , taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species , without similar attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are often assumed to be undefended . Here , we provide new data showing that , in contrast to previous studies , species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids . We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants , which are known sources of alkaloids . Our data support the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation . We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms . In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics , we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins . Acquired chemical defenses , or the ability to sequester and use chemicals from the environment against predators or parasites , is one complex phenotype whose evolutionary history has proved difficult to characterize  . Here , we incorporate ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs  into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in poison frogs and more generally in other animals . In the following text , we use the terms alkaloid and toxin interchangeably , although the toxicity of each poison frog alkaloid is not always known or very straightforward  . Similarly , for simplicity we broadly bin species as defended  or undefended  , although little information exists regarding the defensive efficacy of specific alkaloids . In this context , we use the term alkaloid to refer to compounds with nitrogen-containing rings , specifically the subset of lipophilic alkaloids representing classes previously described in anuran integument , for example ‘N-methyldecahydroquinolines’ or ‘lehmizidines’  . In the 1980s , Toft characterized several types of foraging behaviors in neotropical frogs and found that active foraging for ants was common in poisonous frogs  , while sit-and-wait predation on larger prey was common in non-poisonous species  . At the time , it was thought that poisonous dendrobatids synthesized their own alkaloids  , so differences in diet were not considered mechanistically relevant to differences in levels of chemical defense . , 1994a later demonstrated that chemically defended dendrobatid frogs obtained alkaloids from their diet . The new information helped generate the diet-toxicity hypothesis , which posits that shifts from a generalist to a specialist diet are correlated with origins of alkaloid uptake  . Since then , many studies have focused on the diet of poison frogs in an effort to directly connect diet with chemical defense in specific species  and to identify sources of poison frog alkaloids  . In general , most of the studies of poison-frog ecology since the 1990s emphasize or assume that diet is a primary determinant of defense . Although in the 1990s Daly and his colleagues proposed that an alkaloid uptake system was present in the ancestor of Dendrobatidae and is overexpressed in aposematic species  , no details about this purported system were given , and little focus was placed on the physiological processes of alkaloid sequestration in poison frogs for nearly 20 years . Herein we use similar terms that are more directly relevant to the study of acquired chemical defenses: toxin intake , or the amount of toxin consumed; toxin elimination , or the metabolic detoxification and/or elimination of toxins from the body  ; toxin sequestration , or the transport and storage of toxins to a specific location such as the skin  ; and toxin accumulation , or the retention of toxins in an animal , whether or not it is by sequestration processes . Applying ideas from pharmacokinetics to acquired chemical defenses leads us to propose a four-phase evolutionary model , which we call the passive-accumulation hypothesis:  consistent exposure to a toxic compound;  prior existence or evolution of some resistance to the toxin;  change in the elimination rate of the compound that leads to its prolonged retention , hereafter passive accumulation; and  adaptation of molecular pathways to transport and store the compound in a specific location , hereafter sequestration , which results in the chemical defense phenotype . Phases 3 and 4 may both select for increased toxin resistance , initiating a positive feedback loop that could intensify chemical defense and resistance over time . We define passive accumulation as a type of toxin accumulation that is temporary and results from the delay between toxin intake and elimination; an example would be the temporary accumulation then clearance of ibuprofen in blood plasma in humans following ingestion  . We differentiate passive accumulation from sequestration , a term that we argue implies the existence of a derived form of a transport or storage mechanism absent in the ancestor of the taxon , which would permit greater levels of and more long-term toxin accumulation than passive accumulation . To develop and refine this hypothesis , we gathered diet and toxin data from a broad selection of aposematic and inconspicuously colored poison-frog species . Approximately 100 of the 345 dendrobatid poison-frog species  fall into three conspicuously colored and alkaloid-sequestering  clades: Ameerega , Epipedobates , and Dendrobatinae . The other 245 species compose several other primarily inconspicuously colored clades that for the most part have been assumed to lack alkaloid defenses: that is , all Aromobatinae  , all Hyloxalinae  , and some Colostethinae  . According to the phylogenetic placement of defended and undefended species within Dendrobatidae , poison frogs have evolved sequestration of lipophilic alkaloids from consumed arthropods at least three times  , making them a suitable group to study complex phenotypic transitions like the evolution of chemical defense . In total , we surveyed 104 animals representing 32 species of Neotropical frogs including 28 dendrobatid species , 2 bufonids , 1 leptodactylid , and 1 eleutherodactylid  . Each of the major undefended clades in Dendrobatidae  is represented in our dataset , with a total of 14 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed . Finally , we discuss other factors that might influence the evolution of chemical defenses  , the passive accumulation phenotype in a broader evolutionary context  , and possible limitations of this study  . In that vein , we suggest that evolutionary changes in toxin resistance and metabolism are critical physiological shifts that facilitate origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals . Several of the lipophilic alkaloids found in dendrobatid frogs have been traced to arthropod sources , specifically mites  , ants  , and beetles  , although the extent to which such arthropod prey vary in alkaloid diversity and quantity remains relatively unstudied . Regardless , broad-scale shifts in diet content towards a higher proportion of ants and mites have been hypothesized to play an important role in the origin of chemical defense in poison frogs  . Both undefended and defended dendrobatid species consume a large proportion of ants and mites  . Although the defended dendrobatid clades tend to consume proportionally more ants and mites , as in other studies , the undefended lineages do consume a high proportion of ants and mites . Sympatric populations of the undefended Hyloxalus awa and defended Epipedobates espinosai  are both diet specialized , with the former consuming mostly ants and beetles and the latter consuming mostly mites and springtails  . In a lab experiment , the defended species Dendrobates tinctorius preferred fruit fly larvae over ants when given the choice  , suggesting that even in defended species , consumption of possible alkaloid-containing prey is not necessarily a preference . Another study revealed that Oophaga sylvatica alkaloid quantity is inversely correlated with numbers of consumed ants and mites; however , this species consumed more mites and ants than sympatric Hyloxalus elachyhistus  . Thus , if we assume that many ants and mites contain alkaloids , it is likely that most if not all dendrobatids and their most recent common ancestors have long been exposed to toxins through their diet . Few if any experiments have been done to quantify the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs . Given the broad diversity of alkaloid classes found in poison frogs  , it is very difficult to predict or quantify all possible types or variations of alkaloid resistance that exist across species , or in their ancestors . If an animal does not or cannot avoid toxin exposure , it will need to survive exposure using toxin metabolism or target modification mechanisms such as biotransformation , elimination , alternative targets , and target-site resistance  . Given their diet , dendrobatids clearly do not completely avoid toxin exposure , and thus they are likely to survive exposure using some manner of toxin metabolism or target modification . Indeed , target-site resistance to some alkaloids evolved in several defended dendrobatid clades and in some undefended species  . A few defended species have alternative target mechanisms including binding proteins like alpha-binding globulin  and saxiphilin  that might prevent alkaloids from accessing their molecular targets  . For example , poison frogs may biotransform alkaloids into less toxic forms until they can be eliminated from the body , for example using cytochrome p450s  . Although more data are necessary to understand the evolution of toxin resistance in dendrobatids  , existing data suggest that all or nearly all dendrobatids are exposed to alkaloids  and that alkaloid resistance varies among lineages . To understand the major evolutionary transition from consuming to sequestering toxins , it is essential to characterize the metabolism and sequestration of alkaloids in defended and undefended dendrobatid lineages  . By reviewing existing data , we found that only 31 of the 245 inconspicuous poison frog species described to date AmphibiaWeb , 2023 have been assessed for toxins , sometimes using methods that would not necessarily detect lipophilic alkaloids  . Our review and reassessment of these studies suggest that at least 11 undefended species might have lipophilic alkaloids: Allobates femoralis , Allobates kingsburyi , Allobates zaparo , Colostethus ucumari , H . We tested for possible alkaloid presence in additional aposematic and inconspicuously colored poison-frog lineages . Using Gas-Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry  , we surveyed 89 animals representing 30 species of Neotropical frogs including 27 dendrobatid species , 1 leptodactylid , and 2 bufonids  . We also performed a highly sensitive , untargeted analysis —ultra-high-performance liquid-chromatography heated-electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry  — of a dendrobatid from an undefended clade  and a species of eleutherodactylid  , in which alkaloid diversities and types , but not quantities , were assessed . Each of the major undefended clades in Dendrobatidae  is represented in our dataset with a total of 13 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed with GC-MS and 1 undefended dendrobatid species surveyed with UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS . As far as we are aware , we provide alkaloid data for the first time for six undefended dendrobatid species  and one defended species  . Because chemical standards for most poison frog alkaloids do not exist , it is not possible to provide absolute quantification of alkaloids . Reported values for GC-MS data are in units of integrated area , which do not directly correspond to alkaloid quantity because of differences in ion yield . Overall , we detected alkaloids in skins from 13 of the 14 undefended dendrobatid species included in our study , although often with less diversity and relatively lower quantities than in defended lineages  . The pervasiveness of low alkaloid levels in undefended dendrobatid lineages  contrasts with the mixed or opposing evidence from previous analyses  . In addition , our GC-MS assessment revealed substantially higher diversities of alkaloids in defended dendrobatid species than previously reported  , and expands knowledge on major classes of alkaloids within genera . The large number of structures that we identified is in part due to the way we reviewed GC-MS data: in addition to searching for alkaloids with known fragmentation patterns , we also searched for anything that could qualify as an alkaloid mass spectrometrically but that may not match a previously known structure in a reference database . Although contamination across samples is possible , it is unlikely to invalidate the identification of alkaloids in undefended species based on the following . At several sites , we only sampled undefended species , and these individuals were found to contain alkaloids  ; that is these cannot possibly have come from contamination by defended species . At one site where we collected both undefended and defended species , the undefended species shows no alkaloids  ; i . At two sites where the undefended species were prepared on a different day from the defended species  and could not have been cross-contaminated , the undefended species still show evidence of alkaloids . Data collected by a different team and analyzed with different methods also identify alkaloids in an undefended dendrobatid  from Panama . Data from this and other studies point to the ubiquity of mites and ants in nearly all dendrobatid diets , and possibly more generally in other leaf-litter dwelling frogs  . This finding in concert with the detection of low levels of alkaloids in the lineages that putatively lack chemical defenses leads us to hypothesize that dietary shifts are not sufficient to explain the presence or absence of the chemical defense phenotype within Dendrobatidae or possibly in other families  . The total amount of alkaloids accumulated is a result of multiple processes including toxin intake , elimination , and sequestration  — not just intake alone . For example , dendrobatid species vary in their ability to eliminate alkaloids . Some appear to lack specific transport and storage mechanisms for consumed alkaloids  , yet they have detectable levels of alkaloids in their skin; we refer to this phenotype as passive accumulation and suggest that it is an evolutionary intermediate between toxin consumption  and sequestration  . We predict that the ancestral state of poison frogs and potentially other clades with alkaloid-sequestering species  is alkaloid consumption and low levels of alkaloid resistance , accompanied by passive alkaloid accumulation  . That we detected alkaloids in two genera of bufonid toads could reflect a single origin of passive accumulation in the ancestor of the clade that includes Dendrobatidae and its sister group  . Further sampling for alkaloids within Eleutherodactylidae and Leptodactylidae could reveal whether passive accumulation has persisted in these clades . Discriminating a single origin — no matter the timing — from multiple ones would require more extensive alkaloid surveys , as we only assessed four non-dendrobatid species . Many animals occasionally or frequently consume toxins , and a multitude have evolved toxin resistance . Yet , not all toxin-exposed or toxin-resistant species inevitably evolve chemical defenses , presumably because the ecological context or physiology that favors accumulation is absent or because resisting and accumulating toxins is too costly . Acquired chemical defenses usually evolve within the context of a tri-trophic interaction: animals in the middle of the food web accumulate toxins from their prey , and possible predators or parasites are deterred by the accumulated toxin  . If there is no predator or parasite present to exert selection on a toxin-consuming animal , there may be no benefit for the animal to accumulate the toxins . Thus , the evolution of chemical defenses may be constrained by the specific chemicals present in an ecosystem , the existing trophic interactions among species , and the physiology of predators and parasites in relation to the chemicals in question . Origins of chemical defenses are also shaped by the cost of resisting and accumulating toxins , which can change over evolutionary time as animals adapt to novel relationships with toxins . In poison frogs and other toxin-accumulating animals , it is common to observe a few amino acid substitutions in ion channels that provide target-site resistance to alkaloids but adversely affect the function of the protein; these substitutions are often accompanied by additional , compensatory substitutions that restore protein function without affecting resistance  . Once chemical defenses evolve , they are often further shaped by co-evolution between the defended prey and their predators  , which can result in the appearance of visual or morphological signals , mimicry , and even the loss of defenses in the prey if the predator evolves sufficient resistance  . The transition from passive accumulation to sequestration in poison frogs may similarly rely on the use of proteins that bind to and transport alkaloids  . If toxin accumulation is both low-cost and beneficial , slow toxin elimination rates could evolve quite readily , resulting in passive accumulation . Two recent studies support the idea that some toxin resistance permits toxin intake and results in passive accumulation . In a another example , the sawfly Athalia rosae shows constant turnover of its glucosinolate toxins , suggesting that these insects cannot effectively store glucosinolates , yet their metabolic clearing is inefficient enough that they still maintain a high level of toxins in the hemolymph  . It is conceivable , then , that in some cases , passive accumulation could result in chemical defense through a mechanism that enables high net toxin intake , followed by evasion of elimination mechanisms , passive entry into the bloodstream , and diffusion into other tissues . Evidence for this passive-accumulation phenotype as an intermediate stage on the path towards toxin sequestration is scarce , but passive accumulation is a pervasive pattern in studies of ecological toxicology and may be more common in lineages that evolved toxin sequestration than we currently know . Our study presents a novel alkaloid dataset for dendrobatid frogs and some relatives , yet it is limited in the following ways . For some species we only sampled one or two individuals , which may paint an incomplete picture of toxin diversity , toxin quantity , and diet in the group . Poison frogs vary substantially over time , space , and seasons in their alkaloid profiles and diets  , yet we did not conduct serial sampling over a broad geographic range for each species . Standards are unavailable for most frog alkaloids and thus we could not measure absolute quantity . The nature of these data means that qualitative comparisons may be meaningful but quantitative comparisons across alkaloid structures could be misleading , especially given our small sample sizes for some species . Here , we provide new evidence showing that undefended poison frogs and frogs in a closely related family  contain measurable amounts of alkaloids , and we confirm that they consume some amount of toxic arthropod prey . We propose that passive accumulation of consumed alkaloids is an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae , and possibly in related taxa , and that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense . Future studies of the toxicokinetics of alkaloids in different tissues of both defended and undefended poison frogs will shed light on these putative intermediate evolutionary steps . A set of known standards was run to give accurate retention times across the range of alkaloids and normalized to literature data using linear regression . Samples from Panama and Texas were extracted on separate occasions , then filtered and run in tandem with UHPLC-HESI-MS/MS , following an untargeted metabolomics protocol , with conditions optimized specifically for retention and subsequent identification of alkaloids  . With respect to the compounds exclusive to the positive reference sample  , at >99% confidence , the algorithms implemented in SIRIUS also predicted annotations consistent with an epibatidine alkaloid for a feature only detected in the positive reference sample , at the levels of most specific class  and class and superclass  . Furthermore , due to the lack of liquid-chromatography-derived references for poison-frog alkaloids , precise alkaloid annotations from the UHPLC-HESI-MSMS dataset could not be obtained . "

         "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) contributes significantly to chemotherapy resistance and remains a critical challenge in treating advanced breast cancer . The complexity of EMT , involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process , mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ) , has hindered the development of effective treatments . In this study , we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells . Our findings revealed elevated ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes . RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion . Importantly , inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells . Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies . Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer . \n Tumor cells exploit the transdifferentiation program of EMT to acquire aggressive properties , including anchorage-independent survival , invasion , and stemness ( Nieto et al . , 2016 ) . Multiple growth factors ( TGFβ , EGF , Wnts , etc ) , signaling pathways ( Smad2/3 , PI3K/Akt , ERK1/2 , etc ) , EMT transcription factors ( Snail , Twist , Zeb1/2 , etc ) , and hundreds of downstream EMT related genes are involved in the EMT program ( Nieto et al . , 2016 ) . Such complexity leads to a wide spectrum of EMT phenotypes coexisting at different stages of tumors ( Williams et al . , 2019; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . The EMT-endowed features contribute to tumor heterogeneity , metastasis , and therapy resistance , making EMT an attractive therapeutic target . Current EMT-targeting strategies focus on blocking EMT stimuli , signaling transduction , or mesenchymal features ( Williams et al . , 2019; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . However , these approaches may paradoxically promote the reversed process of EMT , MET , which also contributes to malignancy development ( Gao et al . , 2012; Pei et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype , inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies ( Williams et al . , 2019; Yang et al . , 2020 ) . To investigate the EMT process in metastatic tumor progression , we previously developed an EMT lineage-tracing model ( Tri-PyMT ) by combining MMTV-PyMT , Fsp1 ( S100a4 ) -Cre , and Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice ( Fischer et al . , 2015 ) . This model traces EMT via a permanent RFP-to-GFP fluorescence switch induced by mesenchymal-specific Cre expression . The absence of EMT reporting in metastatic lesions in this model has sparked a lively debate about the proper definition of EMT status in tumor cells and the biological significance of EMT in tumor progression ( Williams et al . , 2019; Brabletz et al . , 2018 ) . Rheenen’s group also posited that the Fsp1-Cre mediated EMT lineage tracing model might not accurately capture the majority of EMT events in comparison to an E cadherin-CFP model ( Bornes et al . , 2019 ) . Although we disagree with this assessment of the Fsp1-Cre model’s fidelity in tracing EMT , we acknowledge the limitations of relying on a single EMT marker to investigate the EMT contributions in tumor metastasis . Notably , using the refined EMTracer animal models , Li et al . , 2020 discovered that N-cadherin + cells , rather than the Vimintin + cells , were predominantly enriched in lung metastases . These findings with different mesenchymal-specific markers underscore the complex nature of the EMT process; metastasis formation does not necessarily require the expression of many traditional mesenchymal markers . The Tri-PyMT model , despite its limitations in comprehensive tracing of metastasis , provides unique opportunities to study EMT’s role in tumor progression and chemoresistance . In particular , the fluorescent marker switch of the established Tri-PyMT cell line reliably reports changes in EMT phenotypes ( Fischer et al . , 2015; Lourenco et al . , 2020 ) . Using scRNA-seq technology , we characterized the differential contributions of EMT tumor cells in tumor progression ( Lourenco et al . , 2020 ) . Importantly , post-EMT ( GFP+ ) , mesenchymal tumor cells consistently demonstrated robust chemoresistant features compared to their parental epithelial cells ( pre-EMT RFP+ ) ( Fischer et al . , 2015 ) , inspiring us to further study chemoresistance using the Tri-PyMT model . \n In contrast to their persistence in the epithelial state ( RFP+ ) in vivo ( Fischer et al . , 2015; Lourenco et al . , 2020 ) , RFP + Tri PyMT cells actively transition to GFP + in vitro in a growth medium containing 10% FBS ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . As the fluorescent switch is irreversible , GFP + cells accumulate over generations until a balanced ratio of RFP+/GFP + is reached . This phenomenon indicates that the Tri-PyMT actively reports the ongoing EMT process in an EMT-promoting culture condition . Interestingly , we observed a subpopulation of cells , which were double positive for RFP and GFP , constituting approximately 2–5% of total cells ( Figure 1A ) . We posited that these RFP+/GFP+ ( Doub+ ) cells represent tumor cells transitioning from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state , since their fluorescent marker cassette has switched to GFP expression induced by Fsp1-Cre , while pre-existing RFP protein lingers due to its tardy degradation . Indeed , immunoblotting analyses confirmed the association of the double positive fluorescence and a hybrid EMT status . Doub+ cells expressed intermediate levels of both epithelial markers ( Epcam and E-cadherin ) and the mesenchymal marker ( Vimentin ) ( Figure 1B ) . Further characterization of the Doub+ cells revealed higher percentages of S and G2/M phase cells in the Doub+ population compared to the RFP + and GFP + subpopulations ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . To further investigate the differential transcriptome in these EMT transitioning cells , we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis using flow cytometry-sorted RFP+ , Doub+ , and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells . Consistently , analysis of traditional EMT marker genes revealed that Doub+ cells expressed both epithelial and mesenchymal markers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . Differentially expressed genes in Doub+ cells were divided into four clusters , Trans_Up , Trans_Down , Epithelial , and Mesenchymal markers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . Upregulated genes within the Trans_Up cluster particularly attracted our attention , as they may represent activated pathways specific to the transitioning phase of EMT . Interestingly , a gene set over-representative assay showed that the KEGG_Ribosome pathway was significantly enriched in the Trans_Up gene list ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ) . Together , these results indicate that Doub+ Tri PyMT cells represent an active EMT-transitioning phase , as evidenced by well-established EMT markers; specific activations of biological processes in Doub+ cells warrant further investigation for developing effective strategies to intervene in the transition . To gain a deeper understanding of transcriptome alterations and ensure adequate representation of EMT-transitioning cells , RFP+ , GFP+ , and Doub+ cells were sorted simultaneously via flow cytometry; equal numbers of each population were remixed and subject for scRNA-seq analysis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) . The t-SNE plot demonstrated two major clusters ( Figure 1C ) : one predominantly expressed epithelial genes , while the other displayed overall mesenchymal phenotypes . Doub+ cells were integrated into the two major clusters , suggesting that the overall single-cell transcriptome may not be sensitive enough to identify tumor cells at the EMT-transitioning phase . We , therefore , performed cell trajectory analysis ( Monocle 2 ) based on all EMT-related genes ( EMTome Vasaikar et al . , 2021 ) . Five cell states related to EMT status were identified ( Figure 1D ) . All of them aligned well with a specific expression pattern of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes based on AUC values ( Figure 1E ) , or individual epithelial/mesenchymal pairs , such as Fsp1/Epcam and Vim/Krt18 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C ) . Furthermore , we calculated the EMT pseudotime of each cell and designated State 1 ( the most epithelial state ) as the root ( Figure 1F ) . Cells were then classified into three main categories , Epi ( State 1 cells ) , Trans ( State 5&2 ) , and Mes ( State 4&3 ) , based on their position within the EMT spectrum ( Figure 1G ) . Differential gene expression analysis confirmed that Trans cells gained expression of mesenchymal markers such as Cdh2 , Vim , Fn1 , and Zeb2 , while retaining expression of epithelial markers such as Krt7 ( Figure 1H ) . With the differential expression gene list , we analyzed the pathway activation in Trans cells by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) with the biology process ( BP ) gene sets of the GO term ( Liberzon et al . , 2015 ) . Among the 49 overlapped gene sets that represented significantly upregulated pathways when comparing Trans vs . Epi and Trans vs . Mes ( p<0 . 05 ) , six pathways were related to the ribosome or rRNA processing ( Figure 1I , Figure 1—source data 2 ) . These findings were in line with the previous bulk RNA sequencing analysis that indicated activation of RiBi pathway in EMT-transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells . Consistently , GSEA using scRNAseq confirmed significant enrichment of RiBi genes in Trans cells compared to cells at Epi or Mes phase ( Figure 1J ) . We further mapped the EMT spectrum of cells based on their EMT pseudotimes or cell states , and correlated them with their RiBi activities . A significant trend of RiBi activation was observed in the transitioning phase of EMT ( Figure 1K , Figure 1—figure supplement 3D ) . It is worth noting that the RiBi activity is lowest in cells characterized with the latest EMT pseudotime , indicating that the elevation of RiBi activities is transient during EMT ( Figure 1K ) . RT-PCR analysis also confirmed the higher expression of RiBi-related genes in Doub+ cells compared to RFP + and GFP + cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . The transient elevation of RiBi during EMT prompted us to ask whether the MET process required the same . Since the fluorescence switch of Tri-PyMT cells is permanent , we tracked MET by monitoring the regain of epithelial marker by post-EMT ( GFP+/Epcam- ) cells . We sorted GFP+/Epcam- Tri-PyMT cells via flow cytometry and injected them into Scid mice via tail vein . Approximately 50% of tumor cells expressed EpCam 4 weeks post-injection , indicating active MET ( Figure 2A ) . We then sorted GFP+ tumor cells , including both EpCam+ and EpCam- cells , from the lungs for scRNA-seq analyses ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Similar to our observations with in vitro cultured Tri-PyMT cells , GFP + cells from lungs formed two main clusters in the t-SNE plot , exhibiting overall epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes ( Figure 2B ) . We performed trajectory analysis with EMTome genes and identified nine cell states with different EMT statuses ( Figure 2C ) . The relative expression of epithelial versus mesenchymal markers clearly illustrated the MET spectrum of tumor cells ( Figure 2D , Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . By designating the most extreme mesenchymal state ( State 1 ) as the root , we calculated the MET pseudotime of individual cells ( Figure 2E ) . Consistent with the analysis for EMT , we found that tumor cells with epithelial phenotypes displayed elevated RiBi activity ( Figure 2F , Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) , indicating its reactivation during the MET process . A significant positive correlation was detected between RiBi gene upregulation and MET pseudotime ( Figure 2G ) . To eliminate the possibility that activation of the RiBi pathway was solo related to the proliferation of cells , we project the S phase score to the scatter plot of Ribi activity/MET pseudotime . Indeed , cells in the far mesenchymal state show a low S phase score , while the proliferating cells were mostly detected in the transitioning phase and epithelial phase ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . Together , these results suggested that the upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs . Ribosome biogenesis was recognized as a crucial factor in cancer pathogenesis a century ago ( Pelletier et al . , 2018 ) . To further investigate the signaling pathways responsible for RiBi upregulation in the EMT/MET process , we sorted RFP+ , Doub+ , and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells and probed the signaling activations in these cells . In response to serum stimulation , Doub+ cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( p-ERK ) and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 ( p-mTORC1 ) compared to either RFP+ or GFP+ cells ( Figure 3A ) . The phosphorylation of Rps6 , an essential ribosome protein of the 40 S subunit , is regulated by synergistic crosstalk between mTORC1 and ERK signaling ( Roux et al . , 2007; Biever et al . , 2015 ) . We thus explored the status of p-Rps6 and observed a significantly higher level of p-Rps6 in Doub+ cells ( Figure 3A ) . These results imply a connection between differential signaling transductions and ribosome activities in EMT transitioning phase cells . The primary function of ribosomes is to synthesize proteins to support essential biological functions ( Ruvinsky and Meyuhas , 2006 ) . Indeed , enhanced ribosome activity in Doub+ cells translated into distinct phenotypes in cell growth and nascent protein synthesis . Flow cytometry analysis showed that Doub+ cells possessed enlarged cell sizes compared to RFP+ or GFP+ cells ( Figure 3B ) . Using the O-propargyl-puromycin ( OPP ) incorporation assay , we found that Doub+ cells exhibited an increased rate of nascent protein synthesis ( Figure 3C ) . Another hallmark of ribosome activity is rRNA transcription , which occurs in nucleoli . By immunostaining Fibrillarin , a nucleolar marker ( Ochs et al . , 1985 ) , we found that the Doub+ cells had significantly more nucleoli compared to cells in epithelial ( RFP+ ) and mesenchymal ( GFP+ ) states ( Figure 3D ) . Consistently , using the EU incorporation assay , we found significantly higher transcription activity in Doub+ cells than in RFP + and GFP + cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Collectively , these results suggest that the elevation of the RiBi pathway in cells at the EMT transitioning phase is associated with aberrant activation of ERK and mTOR signalings , which may , in turn , confer nascent protein synthesis capability to tumor cells for completing phenotypic changes . The transcription of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) is mediated by RNA polymerase I ( Pol I ) in eukaryotic cells ( Moss and Stefanovsky , 2002 ) . Small molecules such as BMH21 and CX5461 are specific Pol I inhibitors , which inhibit rRNA transcription and disrupt ribosome assembly ( Haddach et al . , 2012; Wei et al . , 2018 ) , providing a specific RiBi targeting strategy . We then evaluated whether these Pol I inhibitors would affect the EMT/MET process . Fluorescence switches from RFP + to GFP + of TriPyMT cells were employed to investigate the impact of Pol I inhibitors on EMT . RFP+/Epcam + cells were sorted via flow cytometry and served as cells in an Epithelial state . In contrast to the vehicle-treated RFP+/Epcam + cells , which transitioned to GFP+ upon serum stimulation , most cells treated with either BMH21 or CX5461 stayed in the RFP+ state ( Figure 4A , Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . Of note , the treatment of BMH21 or CX5461 indeed inhibited the transcription activity in cells as detected by EU incorporation assay ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . To confirm that the impaired fluorescence switch of RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells is associated with the retention of epithelial phenotypes , we performed immunoblotting of EMT markers . Indeed , these Pol I inhibitors significantly blocked the expression of mesenchymal markers , including Vimentin and Snail , while preserving the expression of the epithelial marker ( E-cadherin ) ( Figure 4B ) . Given that the elevated RiBi activity occurs during the MET process as well , we further assessed the impact of Pol I inhibitor on the retrieval of epithelial markers by mesenchymal tumor cells . The regain of EpCam expression by the sorted GFP+/EpCam- Tri-PyMT cells in a 3D culture was measured via flow cytometry . BMH21 significantly prevented the Epcam retrieval by GFP+/Epcam- Tri-PyMT cells , suggesting the impaired MET capability upon treatment ( Figure 4C ) . These results laid a foundation for pharmacological inhibition of the RiBi pathway to block the EMT/MET of tumor cells . The requirement of RiBi activity during EMT/MET transitioning was also demonstrated by genetically modulating ribosome proteins . As the organelle for protein synthesis , the ribosome comprises 4 ribosomal RNAs and approximately 80 structural ribosomal proteins ( Pelletier et al . , 2018 ) . Depleting one r-protein usually causes decreases of other r-proteins in the same subunit , and ultimately compromises the overall ribosome assembly ( Robledo et al . , 2008 ) . We , therefore , employed Lenti-shRNAs targeting Rps24 and Rps28 , two essential genes of the 40 S subunit , to genetically modulate the RiBi pathway in Tri-PyMT cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) . Effective knocking-down of Rps24 or Rps28 significantly reduced the number of nucleoli ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B ) . Accompanying the downregulated RiBi activities were the impeded EMT ( RFP to GFP switch ) and the similarly reduced MET ( regain of Epcam ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2C and D ) . These results suggested that the elevated RiBi activities are critical for tumor cells to maintain their abilities to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal states . To assess the overall impact of Pol I inhibitor on both epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells , we treated unsorted Tri-PyMT cells ( containing both RFP + and GFP + populations ) with BMH21 for 7 days . Less accumulation of GFP + cells was observed with BMH21 treatment compared with untreated controls ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , treatment with the chemotherapy drug , cyclophosphamide ( CTX ) , resulted in more GFP + cells ( Figure 5A ) , consistent with our previous findings that chemoresistant features against CTX were acquired through EMT ( Fischer et al . , 2015 ) . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that the blockade of EMT by Pol I inhibitor would reduce the EMT-mediated chemoresistance . The combination therapies of Pol I inhibitor and chemo drugs were therefore tested . We treated Tri-PyMT cells , which contain approximately 15% GFP + cells , with a series of BMH21 concentrations with or without CTX . Cytotoxic assay after 3 days of treatment revealed an enhanced sensitivity of tumor cells to the combination therapies ( Figure 5B ) . Interestingly , BMH21 and CTX exhibited optimal synergy ( Figure 5C ) . Particularly at concentrations of 100–200 nM , BMH21 showed significantly high synergy scores with CTX ( δhigh = 8 . 45 ) . Such low concentrations of BMH21 were approximately 10–20% of the ICmax in Tri-PyMT cells and have also been shown to effectively block the EMT/MET process , suggesting the synergy was likely induced by EMT blockade , rather than cytotoxicity of BMH21 . Importantly , the synergic effect between BMH21 and chemotherapy drugs is not limited to CTX . We performed the combination treatment of BMH21 with the most commonly used chemo drugs of breast cancer therapy , including 5FU , Cisplatin , Doxorubicin , Gemcitabine , and Paclitaxol . Trends toward synergies were also found with most of them , especially with lower concentrations of BMH21 ( 100–200 nM ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . These results suggest that RiBi blockade by the Pol I inhibitor may represent an effective approach to overcome EMT-related chemoresistance . Both the reduced EMT-mediated chemoresistance and the diminished MET during metastatic outgrowth upon BMH21 treatment encouraged us to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy for treating animals bearing metastatic breast tumors . We established a competitive metastasis assay by injecting an equivalent number of GFP+ and RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells ( GFP: RFP , 1:1 , representing epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells , respectively ) into Scid mice via the tail vein . Tumor-bearing mice received the vehicle , single , or combination therapy of BMH21 ( 25 mg/kg , five times/week for 3 weeks , ip . ) and CTX ( 100 mg/kg , once a week for 3 weeks , i . p . ) . Bioluminescent imaging ( BLI ) revealed that the combination treatment exhibited the highest restraint on the chemoresistant outgrowth of metastatic tumors compared to the vehicle , BMH21 , or CTX mono-treatment groups ( Figure 6A ) . To analyze the differential impacts of the therapies on epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells , we quantified the residual RFP + and GFP + cells by flow cytometry analysis . Both RFP + and GFP + cells were significantly decreased in mice receiving the combination therapy of BMH21 and CTX ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Microscopic analyses also revealed that both RFP+ and GFP+ cells grew into macrometastases in the lungs of vehicle-treated animals ( Figure 6B ) . Notably , many GFP+ cells displayed epithelial markers , such as EpCam ( Figure 6C ) , indicating that a MET process was involved during the outgrowth of lung metastasis . CTX treatment eliminated the majority of RFP+/epithelial metastases , while the GFP+/mesenchymal cells showed survival advantages under chemotherapy , resulting in a higher ratio of GFP: RFP . BMH21 treatment inhibited metastatic tumor growth . Interestingly , most tumor cells under BMH21 treatment kept their EMT phenotypes as RFP+/Epcam+ or GFP+/Epcam- ( Figure 6C ) , indicating the impaired EMT/MET transitioning by RiBi inhibition . Importantly , the combination of BMH21 and CTX eliminated most tumor cells including both RFP + and GFP + cells , and significantly inhibited the outgrowth of metastatic nodules under chemotherapy ( Figure 6B and C ) . We further established an experimental lung metastasis model with human breast cancer cells ( MDA-MB231-LM2 ) . The LM2 cells predominantly exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype in vitro and gained Ecad expression during the outgrowth of lung nodules in vivo ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) , indicating the involvement of the MET process . Consistent with the Tri-PyMT model , BMH21 synergized with CTX , leading to a significantly lower metastatic LM2 tumor burden than the mock or mono-treatment groups ( Figure 6D ) . To further investigate the potential association of RiBi activity with EMT status of tumor cells in human breast cancer , we analyzed scRNA-seq data of primary tumor cells from two breast cancer patients ( GSE 198745 ) . A trend of relatively higher RiBi activity was detected in tumor cells with lower EMT pseudotime ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . Interestingly , a pattern showing the highest RiBi activity in EMT/MET transitioning phase was detected in the sample of patient B ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3F ) , indicating the similar role of RiBi upregulation in EMT status of breast cancer patients . To examine whether RiBi activity is associated with clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients , we analyze the RNAseq data in cBioPortal databases ( https://www . cbioportal . org ) , including the TCGA PanCancer Atlas ( 1084 samples ) and METABRIC ( 2500 samples ) . RiBi activities of tumors were quantified by the average z-scores of genes in the RiBi pathway ( 303 genes ) . Patient samples with a score >1 were denoted as RiBiHigh , while patients with a score <0 . 5 were denoted as RiBiLow . The analyses of the survival data showed a significantly worse prognosis in the RiBiHigh group compared to the RiBiLow group ( Figure 6—figure supplement 4 ) . In summary , these results suggest that inhibition of RiBi activities diminished EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells . In combination with chemotherapy drugs , RiBi inhibition significantly reduced the outgrowth of chemoresistant metastasis . These results suggested that targeting the RiBi-mediated EMT/MET process may provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer . \n Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression . Using the EMT-lineage-tracing model , we found an upregulation of the RiBi pathway at the transitioning phase of both EMT and MET ( Figure 7 ) . The transient activation of the RiBi pathway during the EMT process has been reported previously . Prakash et al . found that elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ , fueling the EMT program in breast tumor cells ( Prakash et al . , 2019 ) . Using the Tri-PyMT model , we found that the EMT transitioning ( Doub+ ) cells had higher percentages of cells in the S and G2/M phases compared to the RFP + and GFP + cells . This is inconsistent with the observation that RiBi activity was higher in G1-arrested cells treated with TGFβ ( Prakash et al . , 2019 ) . This discrepancy may be due to the different EMT stimuli used in the experiment systems . Additionally , further investigations are needed to determine whether a cell could complete the EMT process within a single cell cycle or requires multiple cell divisions . A more recent study identified a subpopulation of circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) in which high RiBi activities persisted to maintain their high metastatic potentials ( Ebright et al . , 2020 ) . Interestingly , the RiBi activity was associated with epithelial phenotypes rather than mesenchymal ones in CTCs ( Ebright et al . , 2020 ) . Indeed , EMT induction by TGFβ primarily suppressed ribosome gene expression and global translational activity ( Ebright et al . , 2020 ) . By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model , we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program . The enhanced activation of the RiBi pathway diminished as tumor cells accomplished phenotype changes . In general , a lower RiBi activity was observed in the mesenchymal tumor cells than in the epithelial ones . Importantly , the involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis . Targeting the RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics . These observations also suggest that malignant cells may require a certain ease to ‘ping pong’ between epithelial and mesenchymal states to adapt to the challenging microenvironment . Of note , some commonly used chemotherapeutics ( Cisplatin , 5FU , Doxorubicin , etc ) , although primarily targeting DNA duplications , may also affect the RiBi pathway by inhibiting rRNA processing ( Burger et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , the synergic effects of Pol I inhibitor varied among different combinations . Moreover , RiBi is a process that is dysregulated in most , if not all , cancers . Its involvement in the EMT/MET process makes it a feasible targeted pathway for treating patients with advanced breast cancer . \n Tri-PyMT cells were established in our lab from primary tumors of MMTV-PyMT/Fsp1-Cre/Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice ( Fischer et al . , 2015 ) . For experiments , we used Tri-PyMT cells from passage 5 ( p5 ) to passage 10 ( p10 ) which contains both RFP +and GFP + cells . MDA-MB231-LM2 cells were a gift from Dr . Joan Massague . To facilitate in vivo imaging , both cell lines were genetically labeled with luciferase by lenti-Puro-Luc . Cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS , 1% L-Glutamine , and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin . A routine assay for Mycoplasma ( Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit , ATCC , Cat#30–1012 K ) was performed to avoid contaminations . All animal works were performed following IACUC-approved protocols at Weill Cornell Medicine . CB-17 SCID mice were obtained from Charles River ( Wilmington , MA ) . For the experimental metastasis model , RFP + and GFP + Tri PyMT cells were sorted from the 5-10th passage cells and re-mixed at a ratio of 1:1 . Total cells ( 1 . 5×105 cells ) were injected through the tail vein in 100 µL of PBS in 10-week-old females . For animals subjected to chemotherapy , Cyclophosphamide ( CTX , 100 mg/kg , Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# C0768 ) was administered once per week , i . p . , for 3–4 weeks . BMH21 ( 25 mg/kg , Sellechehem , Cat#S7718 ) was administrated five times/week , i . p . , for 3–4 weeks . The progression of lung metastasis tumors was monitored by bioluminescent imaging ( BLI ) every 3–5 days on the Xenogen IVIS system coupled with analysis software ( Living Image; Xenogen ) . For cultured cells , single-cell suspensions were prepared by trypsinization and neutralizing with the growth medium containing 10% FBS . For the metastatic lungs , cell suspensions were prepared by digesting tissues with an enzyme cocktail containing collagenase IV ( 1 mg/mL ) , hyaluronidase ( 50 units/mL ) , and DNase I ( 0 . 1 mg/mL ) in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution containing calcium ( HBSS , Gibco ) at 37 °C for 20–30 min . Cells were filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer ( BD Biosciences ) and stained with anti-Epcam antibody ( G8 . 8 , Biolegend ) , if needed , following a standard immunostaining protocol . SYTOX Blue ( Invitrogen ) was added to the staining tube in the last 5 min to facilitate the elimination of dead cells . Samples were analyzed using the BD LSRFortessa Flow Cytometer coupled with FlowJo_v10 software ( FlowJo , LLC ) . GFP+ and RFP+ cells were detected by their endogenous fluorescence . Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a variety of controls including isotype antibodies , and unstained and single-color stained samples for determining appropriate gates , voltages , and compensations required in multivariate flow cytometry . For fluorescence-activated cell sorting for in vitro culture or tail vein injection , we used the Aria II cell sorter coupled with FACS Diva software ( BD Biosciences ) . Cell preparation was performed throughout sorting procedures under sterile conditions . The purity of subpopulations after sorting was confirmed by analyzing post-sort samples in the sorter again . Total RNA was extracted from sorted RFP+ , GFP+ , and Double + Tri PyMT cells with the RNeasy Plus Kit ( Qiagen ) . RNA-Seq libraries were constructed and sequenced following standard protocols ( Illumina ) at the Genomics and Epigenetics Core Facility of WCM . RNA-seq data were analyzed with customized Partek Flow software ( Partek Inc ) . In brief , the RNA-seq data were aligned to the mouse transcriptome reference ( mm10 ) by STAR after pre-alignment QA/QC control . Quantification of gene expression was performed with the annotation model ( PartekE/M ) and normalized to counts per million ( CPM ) . Differential gene expression was performed with the Gene Specific Analysis ( GSA ) algorithm , which applied multiple statistical models to each gene to account for its varying response to different experimental factors and different data distribution . For heatmap visualizations , Z scores were calculated based on normalized per-gene counts . Algorisms for the biological interpretation of differential expressions between samples such as GSEA and Over-representation assay , are also integrated into the Partek Flow platform . Gene sets of interests were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database ( MSigDB , https://www . gsea-msigdb . org/gsea/msigdb ) . The raw and processed bulk RNA-seq data were available at Gene Expression Omnibus ( GSE178576 ) . Single-cell suspensions were prepared following protocols from 10 X Genomics . RFP+ , GFP+ , and Double+ Tri-PyMT cells were sorted by flow cytometry , and cells with >90% viability were submitted for sc-RNAseq at the Genomics and Epigenetics Core Facility at WCM . Single-cell libraries were generated using 10 X Genomics Chromium Single-cell 3' Library RNA-Seq Assays protocols targeting 8 , 000 cells from each fraction were sequenced on the NovaSeq sequencer ( Illumina ) . The scRNA-seq data were analyzed with the Partek Flow software ( Partek Inc ) , an integrated user-friendly platform for NGS analysis based on the Seurat R package ( Butler et al . , 2018 ) . The raw sequencing data were aligned to the modified mouse transcriptome reference ( mm10 ) containing RFP , GFP , PyMT , and Cre genes by STAR . The deduplication of UMIs , filtering of noise signals , and quantification of cell barcodes were performed to generate the single-cell count data . Single-cell QA/QC was then controlled by the total counts of UMIs , detected features , and the percentage of mitochondria genes according to each sample ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . The top 20 principal components ( PC ) were used for tSNE visualization . Differential gene expression analysis , GSEA , Geneset Overrepresentation assay , and Cell Trajectory analysis ( Monocle 2 model ) are also integrated into the Partek Flow platform ( Partek Inc ) . To highlight the overall expression of feature genes in a pathway , such as ribosome biogenesis or EMT status , we calculated the AUCell values for the gene list . AUCell calculates a value for each cell by ranking all genes based on their expression in the cell and identifying the proportion of the gene list that falls within the top 5% of all genes . For the epithelial or mesenchymal gene lists , we selected genes based on their overall expression levels in Tri-PyMT cells , ensuring consistency with their reported associations to epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes in the literature ( Figure 1—source data 1 ) . For RiBi genes , we used the ribosome biogenesis pathway gene list from the GOBP_Ribosome_Biogenesis ( GO:0042254 ) in MSigDB . The raw and processed scRNA-seq data were available at Gene Expression Omnibus ( GSE178577 and GSE178578 ) . Lungs with metastases were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight , followed by immersion in 30% sucrose for two days . They were then embedded in the Tissue-Tek O . C . T . compound ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . Serial sections ( 10–20 μm , at least 10 sections ) were prepared for immunofluorescent staining . For staining cultured or sorted cells , 2×103 cells/well were seeded in eight-well chamber slides ( Nunc Lab-Tek , Thermo Fisher ) and cultured overnight in a growth medium . Standard immunostaining protocols were followed using fluorescent-conjugated primary antibodies . Fluorescent images were captured using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope ( Axio Observer ) with Zen 3 . 0 software ( Carl Zeiss Inc ) . Cells were homogenized in 1 x RIPA lysis buffer ( Millipore ) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Roche Applied Science ) . The samples were then boiled in 1 x Laemmli buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and loaded onto 12% gradient Tris-Glycine gels ( Bio-Rad ) . Western blotting was performed using the antibodies listed in the antibody table . Quantification of the Western blots was carried out using ImageJ . The relative intensity of each band was normalized to that of β-actin or tubulin , serving as loading controls for the same blot . To determine the viability of Tri-PyMT cells under chemotherapy , cells ( 2×103 cells/well ) were seeded in 96-well adherent black-walled plates , and treated with a serial concentration of 5-FU , Cisplatin , 4-Hydroperoxy Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Gemcitabine , and Paclitaxel together with BMH21 , for 72 hr . After treatment , cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay ( Promega ) . To quantify the cytotoxic effect and potential synergic effects of drug combinations , we used SynergyFinder 3 . 0 ( Ianevski et al . , 2020 ) for data analysis . Basically , normalized cell viability data were formatted and analyzed with the online server at SunergyFinder ( https://synergyfinder . fimm . fi ) . The LL4 and ZIP methods were chosen for curve fitting and synergy calculation , respectively . To characterize cellular activities in nascent DNA , RNA , and protein synthesis , we applied EdU ( 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine ) , EU ( 5-ethynyl uridine ) , and OPP ( O-propargyl-puromycin ) incorporation assays , respectively . Cells ( 3×105 cells/well ) were seeded in a six-well plate and treated ( or left untreated ) according to experimental settings . Cells were labeled with EdU ( 10 μM , for 30 min ) , EU ( 1 mM , for 1 hr ) , or OPP ( 10 μM , for 30 min ) in the incubator . After labeling , cells were harvested by trypsinization , fixed with 3 . 7% formaldehyde in PBS , and permeabilized with 0 . 5% Triton-X100 in PBS . Labeling was detected using the Click-&-Go detection kit ( Vector Laboratories ) following the standardized protocol and analyzed by flow cytometry . Total RNA was extracted from sorted RFP+ , GFP+ , and Doub+ Tri PyMT cells using the RNeasy Plus Kit ( Qiagen ) . For cDNA synthesis , 100 ng of RNA was used with the qScript cDNA SuperMix ( Quanta Bio ) . Q-PCR was performed using SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix ( Bio-Rad ) with target gene-specific primers ( as shown in the table ) and Gapdh as the housekeeping control . The PCR protocol included an initial denaturation at 98 °C for 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s , 60 °C for 30 s , and 72 °C for 30 s , with signal readings at the end of each cycle . This was followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min and melt curve analysis on the CFX96 Real-Time System ( Bio-Rad ) . To determine the sample size for animal experiments , we performed power analysis assuming the ( difference in means ) / ( standard deviation ) is >2 . 5 . Consequently , all animal experiments were conducted with ≥5 mice per group to ensure adequate power for two-sample t-test comparison or ANOVA . Animals were randomized within each experimental group , and no blinding was applied during the experiments . Results were expressed as mean ± SEM . Data distribution within groups and significance between different treatment groups were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software . p-values <0 . 05 were considered significant . Error bars represent SEM , unless otherwise indicated . The manuscript was prepared following the general recommendations of ICMJE .",

         "The complexity of EMT , involving redundant pro-EMT signaling pathways and its paradox reversal process , mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition  , has hindered the development of effective treatments . In this study , we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing  to comprehensively analyze the EMT status of tumor cells . RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signalings are essential for EMT/MET completion . Importantly , inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells . Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies . Tumor cells exploit the transdifferentiation program of EMT to acquire aggressive properties , including anchorage-independent survival , invasion , and stemness  . Multiple growth factors  , signaling pathways  , EMT transcription factors  , and hundreds of downstream EMT related genes are involved in the EMT program  . The EMT-endowed features contribute to tumor heterogeneity , metastasis , and therapy resistance , making EMT an attractive therapeutic target . Current EMT-targeting strategies focus on blocking EMT stimuli , signaling transduction , or mesenchymal features  . Therefore , we proposed that instead of targeting epithelial or mesenchymal phenotype , inhibiting a biological process mediating the transitions of both EMT and MET could effectively overcome the limitations of traditional strategies  . To investigate the EMT process in metastatic tumor progression , we previously developed an EMT lineage-tracing model  by combining MMTV-PyMT , Fsp1  -Cre , and Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice  . This model traces EMT via a permanent RFP-to-GFP fluorescence switch induced by mesenchymal-specific Cre expression . The absence of EMT reporting in metastatic lesions in this model has sparked a lively debate about the proper definition of EMT status in tumor cells and the biological significance of EMT in tumor progression  . Rheenen’s group also posited that the Fsp1-Cre mediated EMT lineage tracing model might not accurately capture the majority of EMT events in comparison to an E cadherin-CFP model  . Although we disagree with this assessment of the Fsp1-Cre model’s fidelity in tracing EMT , we acknowledge the limitations of relying on a single EMT marker to investigate the EMT contributions in tumor metastasis . These findings with different mesenchymal-specific markers underscore the complex nature of the EMT process; metastasis formation does not necessarily require the expression of many traditional mesenchymal markers . In particular , the fluorescent marker switch of the established Tri-PyMT cell line reliably reports changes in EMT phenotypes  . Using scRNA-seq technology , we characterized the differential contributions of EMT tumor cells in tumor progression  . Importantly , post-EMT  , mesenchymal tumor cells consistently demonstrated robust chemoresistant features compared to their parental epithelial cells   , inspiring us to further study chemoresistance using the Tri-PyMT model . In contrast to their persistence in the epithelial state  in vivo  , RFP + Tri PyMT cells actively transition to GFP + in vitro in a growth medium containing 10% FBS  . This phenomenon indicates that the Tri-PyMT actively reports the ongoing EMT process in an EMT-promoting culture condition . We posited that these RFP+/GFP+  cells represent tumor cells transitioning from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state , since their fluorescent marker cassette has switched to GFP expression induced by Fsp1-Cre , while pre-existing RFP protein lingers due to its tardy degradation . Further characterization of the Doub+ cells revealed higher percentages of S and G2/M phase cells in the Doub+ population compared to the RFP + and GFP + subpopulations  . To further investigate the differential transcriptome in these EMT transitioning cells , we performed bulk RNA sequencing analysis using flow cytometry-sorted RFP+ , Doub+ , and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells . Consistently , analysis of traditional EMT marker genes revealed that Doub+ cells expressed both epithelial and mesenchymal markers  . Together , these results indicate that Doub+ Tri PyMT cells represent an active EMT-transitioning phase , as evidenced by well-established EMT markers; specific activations of biological processes in Doub+ cells warrant further investigation for developing effective strategies to intervene in the transition . To gain a deeper understanding of transcriptome alterations and ensure adequate representation of EMT-transitioning cells , RFP+ , GFP+ , and Doub+ cells were sorted simultaneously via flow cytometry; equal numbers of each population were remixed and subject for scRNA-seq analysis  . Doub+ cells were integrated into the two major clusters , suggesting that the overall single-cell transcriptome may not be sensitive enough to identify tumor cells at the EMT-transitioning phase . We , therefore , performed cell trajectory analysis  based on all EMT-related genes  . All of them aligned well with a specific expression pattern of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes based on AUC values  , or individual epithelial/mesenchymal pairs , such as Fsp1/Epcam and Vim/Krt18  . Differential gene expression analysis confirmed that Trans cells gained expression of mesenchymal markers such as Cdh2 , Vim , Fn1 , and Zeb2 , while retaining expression of epithelial markers such as Krt7  . These findings were in line with the previous bulk RNA sequencing analysis that indicated activation of RiBi pathway in EMT-transitioning  cells . Consistently , GSEA using scRNAseq confirmed significant enrichment of RiBi genes in Trans cells compared to cells at Epi or Mes phase  . We further mapped the EMT spectrum of cells based on their EMT pseudotimes or cell states , and correlated them with their RiBi activities . A significant trend of RiBi activation was observed in the transitioning phase of EMT  . It is worth noting that the RiBi activity is lowest in cells characterized with the latest EMT pseudotime , indicating that the elevation of RiBi activities is transient during EMT  . RT-PCR analysis also confirmed the higher expression of RiBi-related genes in Doub+ cells compared to RFP + and GFP + cells  . The transient elevation of RiBi during EMT prompted us to ask whether the MET process required the same . Since the fluorescence switch of Tri-PyMT cells is permanent , we tracked MET by monitoring the regain of epithelial marker by post-EMT  cells . We sorted GFP+/Epcam- Tri-PyMT cells via flow cytometry and injected them into Scid mice via tail vein . We then sorted GFP+ tumor cells , including both EpCam+ and EpCam- cells , from the lungs for scRNA-seq analyses  . Similar to our observations with in vitro cultured Tri-PyMT cells , GFP + cells from lungs formed two main clusters in the t-SNE plot , exhibiting overall epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes  . We performed trajectory analysis with EMTome genes and identified nine cell states with different EMT statuses  . The relative expression of epithelial versus mesenchymal markers clearly illustrated the MET spectrum of tumor cells  . Consistent with the analysis for EMT , we found that tumor cells with epithelial phenotypes displayed elevated RiBi activity  , indicating its reactivation during the MET process . To eliminate the possibility that activation of the RiBi pathway was solo related to the proliferation of cells , we project the S phase score to the scatter plot of Ribi activity/MET pseudotime . Indeed , cells in the far mesenchymal state show a low S phase score , while the proliferating cells were mostly detected in the transitioning phase and epithelial phase  . Together , these results suggested that the upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs . To further investigate the signaling pathways responsible for RiBi upregulation in the EMT/MET process , we sorted RFP+ , Doub+ , and GFP+ Tri-PyMT cells and probed the signaling activations in these cells . In response to serum stimulation , Doub+ cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase  and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1  compared to either RFP+ or GFP+ cells  . These results imply a connection between differential signaling transductions and ribosome activities in EMT transitioning phase cells . Flow cytometry analysis showed that Doub+ cells possessed enlarged cell sizes compared to RFP+ or GFP+ cells  . By immunostaining Fibrillarin , a nucleolar marker  , we found that the Doub+ cells had significantly more nucleoli compared to cells in epithelial  and mesenchymal  states  . Consistently , using the EU incorporation assay , we found significantly higher transcription activity in Doub+ cells than in RFP + and GFP + cells  . Collectively , these results suggest that the elevation of the RiBi pathway in cells at the EMT transitioning phase is associated with aberrant activation of ERK and mTOR signalings , which may , in turn , confer nascent protein synthesis capability to tumor cells for completing phenotypic changes . Fluorescence switches from RFP + to GFP + of TriPyMT cells were employed to investigate the impact of Pol I inhibitors on EMT . RFP+/Epcam + cells were sorted via flow cytometry and served as cells in an Epithelial state . In contrast to the vehicle-treated RFP+/Epcam + cells , which transitioned to GFP+ upon serum stimulation , most cells treated with either BMH21 or CX5461 stayed in the RFP+ state  . To confirm that the impaired fluorescence switch of RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells is associated with the retention of epithelial phenotypes , we performed immunoblotting of EMT markers . Given that the elevated RiBi activity occurs during the MET process as well , we further assessed the impact of Pol I inhibitor on the retrieval of epithelial markers by mesenchymal tumor cells . The regain of EpCam expression by the sorted GFP+/EpCam- Tri-PyMT cells in a 3D culture was measured via flow cytometry . BMH21 significantly prevented the Epcam retrieval by GFP+/Epcam- Tri-PyMT cells , suggesting the impaired MET capability upon treatment  . These results laid a foundation for pharmacological inhibition of the RiBi pathway to block the EMT/MET of tumor cells . The requirement of RiBi activity during EMT/MET transitioning was also demonstrated by genetically modulating ribosome proteins . We , therefore , employed Lenti-shRNAs targeting Rps24 and Rps28 , two essential genes of the 40 S subunit , to genetically modulate the RiBi pathway in Tri-PyMT cells  . These results suggested that the elevated RiBi activities are critical for tumor cells to maintain their abilities to shift between epithelial and mesenchymal states . To assess the overall impact of Pol I inhibitor on both epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells , we treated unsorted Tri-PyMT cells  with BMH21 for 7 days . In contrast , treatment with the chemotherapy drug , cyclophosphamide  , resulted in more GFP + cells  , consistent with our previous findings that chemoresistant features against CTX were acquired through EMT  . Based on these observations , we hypothesized that the blockade of EMT by Pol I inhibitor would reduce the EMT-mediated chemoresistance . We treated Tri-PyMT cells , which contain approximately 15% GFP + cells , with a series of BMH21 concentrations with or without CTX . Such low concentrations of BMH21 were approximately 10–20% of the ICmax in Tri-PyMT cells and have also been shown to effectively block the EMT/MET process , suggesting the synergy was likely induced by EMT blockade , rather than cytotoxicity of BMH21 . These results suggest that RiBi blockade by the Pol I inhibitor may represent an effective approach to overcome EMT-related chemoresistance . Both the reduced EMT-mediated chemoresistance and the diminished MET during metastatic outgrowth upon BMH21 treatment encouraged us to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy for treating animals bearing metastatic breast tumors . We established a competitive metastasis assay by injecting an equivalent number of GFP+ and RFP+ Tri-PyMT cells  into Scid mice via the tail vein . To analyze the differential impacts of the therapies on epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells , we quantified the residual RFP + and GFP + cells by flow cytometry analysis . Notably , many GFP+ cells displayed epithelial markers , such as EpCam  , indicating that a MET process was involved during the outgrowth of lung metastasis . CTX treatment eliminated the majority of RFP+/epithelial metastases , while the GFP+/mesenchymal cells showed survival advantages under chemotherapy , resulting in a higher ratio of GFP: RFP . Interestingly , most tumor cells under BMH21 treatment kept their EMT phenotypes as RFP+/Epcam+ or GFP+/Epcam-  , indicating the impaired EMT/MET transitioning by RiBi inhibition . Importantly , the combination of BMH21 and CTX eliminated most tumor cells including both RFP + and GFP + cells , and significantly inhibited the outgrowth of metastatic nodules under chemotherapy  . Consistent with the Tri-PyMT model , BMH21 synergized with CTX , leading to a significantly lower metastatic LM2 tumor burden than the mock or mono-treatment groups  . To further investigate the potential association of RiBi activity with EMT status of tumor cells in human breast cancer , we analyzed scRNA-seq data of primary tumor cells from two breast cancer patients  . A trend of relatively higher RiBi activity was detected in tumor cells with lower EMT pseudotime  . Interestingly , a pattern showing the highest RiBi activity in EMT/MET transitioning phase was detected in the sample of patient B  , indicating the similar role of RiBi upregulation in EMT status of breast cancer patients . RiBi activities of tumors were quantified by the average z-scores of genes in the RiBi pathway  . In summary , these results suggest that inhibition of RiBi activities diminished EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells . These results suggested that targeting the RiBi-mediated EMT/MET process may provide a more effective therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer . Targeting EMT for cancer therapy has been challenging due to the complexity of the EMT process and controversies of promoting MET which also favors tumor progression . Using the EMT-lineage-tracing model , we found an upregulation of the RiBi pathway at the transitioning phase of both EMT and MET  . The transient activation of the RiBi pathway during the EMT process has been reported previously . found that elevated rRNA synthesis/RiBi pathway was concomitant with cell cycle arrest induced by TGFβ , fueling the EMT program in breast tumor cells  . Using the Tri-PyMT model , we found that the EMT transitioning  cells had higher percentages of cells in the S and G2/M phases compared to the RFP + and GFP + cells . Additionally , further investigations are needed to determine whether a cell could complete the EMT process within a single cell cycle or requires multiple cell divisions . By employing our unique EMT-lineage-tracing model , we discovered that the RiBi pathway was transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET program . In general , a lower RiBi activity was observed in the mesenchymal tumor cells than in the epithelial ones . Importantly , the involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis . Targeting the RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics . Tri-PyMT cells were established in our lab from primary tumors of MMTV-PyMT/Fsp1-Cre/Rosa26-mTmG transgenic mice  . For experiments , we used Tri-PyMT cells from passage 5  to passage 10  which contains both RFP +and GFP + cells . For the experimental metastasis model , RFP + and GFP + Tri PyMT cells were sorted from the 5-10th passage cells and re-mixed at a ratio of 1:1 . Total RNA was extracted from sorted RFP+ , GFP+ , and Double + Tri PyMT cells with the RNeasy Plus Kit  . RFP+ , GFP+ , and Double+ Tri-PyMT cells were sorted by flow cytometry , and cells with >90% viability were submitted for sc-RNAseq at the Genomics and Epigenetics Core Facility at WCM . Single-cell libraries were generated using 10 X Genomics Chromium Single-cell 3' Library RNA-Seq Assays protocols targeting 8 , 000 cells from each fraction were sequenced on the NovaSeq sequencer  . To highlight the overall expression of feature genes in a pathway , such as ribosome biogenesis or EMT status , we calculated the AUCell values for the gene list . For the epithelial or mesenchymal gene lists , we selected genes based on their overall expression levels in Tri-PyMT cells , ensuring consistency with their reported associations to epithelial or mesenchymal phenotypes in the literature  . To determine the viability of Tri-PyMT cells under chemotherapy , cells  were seeded in 96-well adherent black-walled plates , and treated with a serial concentration of 5-FU , Cisplatin , 4-Hydroperoxy Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Gemcitabine , and Paclitaxel together with BMH21 , for 72 hr . Total RNA was extracted from sorted RFP+ , GFP+ , and Doub+ Tri PyMT cells using the RNeasy Plus Kit  . "

         "Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments . Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region . Pearl millet’s early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate . Using crop modeling , we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated . Furthermore , we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions . Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait . Combining gene expression data , re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator . Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation . In summary , our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment . \n Pearl millet was domesticated about 4500 years ago in the Sahelian part of West Africa ( Burgarella et al . , 2018 ) and is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops ( Debieu et al . , 2017; Varshney et al . , 2017 ) . Today , it is the sixth cereal in terms of world production , and it is mostly cultivated in arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa and India where it plays an important role for food security . However , in Africa , pearl millet yield remains low compared to its genetic potential because it is mostly cultivated in marginal lands in low-input and rainfed agricultural systems and the development and adoption of improved varieties is still limited ( Olodo et al . , 2020 ) . The plant root system is responsible for water and nutrient acquisition from the soil . Breeding for root traits that could improve the crop root system efficiency has been proposed as one of the pillars of a second green revolution ( Den Herder et al . , 2010; Lynch , 2007; Lynch , 2019 ) . Improved crops with optimized soil resources acquisition might be particularly relevant in low-input and rainfed agrosystems found in the Sahelian region of Africa ( Ndoye et al . , 2022 ) . This strategy relies on the selection of root traits suitable for the specific characteristics of the target environment such as soil and climate but also agricultural practices ( Lynch , 2019; Ndoye et al . , 2022; van der Bom et al . , 2020 ) . It requires a better understanding of stress patterns and the performance of individual root traits in real conditions and in response to different constraints . However , only a few studies have addressed the importance of individual root traits in field conditions . Primary root development is an important contributor to seedling vigor and greatly influences plant establishment ( Peter et al . , 2009 ) . Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination ( DAG ) ( Passot et al . , 2016 ) . No seminal roots are present in pearl millet and crown and lateral roots were only observed 6 DAG ( Passot et al . , 2016 ) . We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment ( Passot et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet . Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation . A combination of genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and bulk segregant analysis ( BSA ) on a bi-parental population identified one genomic region controlling this trait . Combining RNAseq , re-sequencing , and re-annotation of this region , we identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene , PgGRXC9 as a potential candidate regulator . Functional characterization of the closest homolog in Arabidopsis reveals a new role for GRX in the regulation of root growth through cell elongation in the root apical meristem . \n We previously hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment and , in particular , to early cycle drought stress episodes ( Passot et al . , 2016 ) . To analyze the frequency and impact of such early drought stress , we first studied meteorological data collected for the past 21 years ( 2000–2020 ) at the CNRA Bambey station , located at the center of the pearl millet growing region of Senegal and highly representative of the climate found in Sahelian West Africa . Crops such as pearl millet are traditionally sown before or shortly after the first rain event of the rainy season . Moisture from the first rain event is used by seed to germinate and initiate their growth . We observed frequent intervals between the first and the second significant rainfall event ( >10 mm ) that could last up to 40 days ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . These periods were unrelated to the timing of the first rain event . A crop model was parameterized using soil and meteorological data ( 2000–2020 ) from the Bambey experimental station to determine when pearl millet faced drought stress and predict its impact on crop yield . Using a widely cultivated variety of pearl millet ( Souna3 ) for modeling , we simulated the daily fraction of transpirable soil water ( FTSW ) profiles in different years to identify periods of the growth cycle when access to water was limiting . FTSW below 0 . 3 was considered a stressful condition as it is the value below which transpiration rate in pearl millet starts to drop due to insufficient water supply from the root to support transpiration ( Kholová et al . , 2010 ) . Clustering the trend of FTSW in the 21 years studied ( based on the methodology of Charrad et al . , 2014 ) revealed three stress patterns: early-stress , late-stress , and no-stress ( blue , red , and green lines in Figure 1A ) . The crop faced early stress at a frequency of 24% over the 21 years , which resulted in an average 43% grain yield penalty compared to years without stress . Biomass production ( an important source of fodder for livestock ) was also reduced by 44% on average . Late-stress occurred in 19% of the years and resulted in 25% and 12% of yield and biomass penalty , respectively . No-stress was observed in 57% of the years . Hence , our analysis confirms that early drought episodes are a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems of West Africa affecting crops during the vegetative stage . In order to test if a fast-growing primary root after germination might be an adaptive trait to early drought stress , we first phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the genetic diversity of the crop ( Debieu et al . , 2018 ) . As primary root growth is linear in the first days of growth ( Passot et al . , 2016 ) , root length was measured as a proxy of growth on a paper-based hydroponic system 6 DAG in 122 pearl millet inbred lines ( 5 plants/line in average for a total of 853 plants ) . Primary root length ranged from 21 . 1 to 193 . 2 mm with an average of 94 . 4 mm and a standard deviation of 32 . 5 mm , thus showing that a large diversity was available for this trait ( Figure 1B ) . The importance of early root growth for plant tolerance to early drought stress was then evaluated in field trials in 2 independent years using nine inbred lines with contrasted root growth ( slow , intermediate , and fast primary root growth ) . Field trials were set up during the hot dry season ( March–June ) in 2018 and 2020 . Seeds were sown and irrigation equivalent to a 30-mm rainfall was applied . Irrigation was then stopped to mimic an early drought stress episode and plant growth and ecophysiological parameters were analyzed for the following 6 weeks ( Supplementary file 1 , Table S1 ) . We then analyzed the correlations between primary root length , measured in the lab , and plant performance measured in field conditions . Principal component analyses revealed a covariation of early primary root growth and stay-green ( the % of leaves that remained green ) as well as the performance index of photosynthesis ( PI ) measured both in 2018 and 2020 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage , an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress ( R = 0 . 95 , p <0 . 01; Figure 1C , D ) . Hence , our field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination . We next studied the genetic determinants of primary root growth in pearl millet . First , the heritability of early primary root growth was analyzed using our paper-based phenotyping data on the panel of inbred lines . Heritability of 0 . 53 was computed indicating that early primary root growth is under strong genetic control in pearl millet . We therefore conducted a GWAS . Genotyping by sequencing of the panel of pearl millet inbred lines provided 392 , 493 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) for association , after filtering on quality , with an average density of 2 . 5 SNPs per 10 kb ( Debieu et al . , 2018 ) . For the current study , a set of 392 , 216 SNPs polymorphic for the 122 inbred lines with a phenotype was selected to conduct GWAS ( de la Fuente Cantó et al . , 2022 ) . GWAS was performed using the ridge latent factor mixed model ( LFMM ) algorithm ( Caye et al . , 2019 ) . In addition , we considered other GWAS methods to contrast the results ( analysis of variance [ANOVA] , efficient mixed model association [EMMA] , or mixed linear model [MLM]; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Our analysis revealed a total of 447 significant SNPs across the pearl millet genome associated with primary root growth from which , 109 SNPs were found highly significant with at least two other methods for association analysis at p-value <10−4 ( Supplementary file 1 , Table S2 ) . Only two of these markers , located on chromosomes 1 and 3 , were above the 0 . 05 false discovery rate significance threshold ( Figure 2A ) . To validate our GWAS analysis , we generated a bi-parental population from two inbred lines with contrasting early primary root growth . The two lines , ICML-IS 11155 ( low primary root growth ) and SL2 ( high primary root growth ) , were selected based on our initial paper-based root phenotyping experiment . The difference in primary root growth between these two lines was confirmed 7 DAG in a paper roll phenotyping system ( p <0 . 001; Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , as well as in soil using X-ray microCT 10 DAG ( p = 0 . 058 but with a low number of samples analyzed; Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , thus demonstrating their contrasting primary root phenotypes were robust and independent of the experimental system . Lines SL2 and ICML-IS 11155 were crossed and 737 F2 plants were phenotyped for early root growth together with their parents ( 33 ICML-IS 11155 and 30 SL2 plants ) . The phenotypes of F2 plants showed a normal distribution encompassing the range of phenotypes from the two parents ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . 75 F2 plants were selected for each extreme phenotype ( 75 highest and 75 lowest growth ) and were used for bulk DNA extraction . The corresponding DNA was then used for genotyping by sequencing . Mean average sequencing depth in the bulks corresponded to 1028X ( high growth ) and 814X ( low growth ) . After filtering , a group of 33 , 582 SNP variants ( 2 . 1 SNP per 100 kb in average ) identified between the bulks was used to assess the differences in allele frequency linked to the root length phenotype . BSA revealed differences in allele frequency for 1285 SNPs ( Figure 2B; Supplementary file 1 , Table S3 ) . Six regions consisting of clusters of neighboring markers with overlapping region of significance defined by simulations ( de la Fuente Cantó and Vigouroux , 2022 ) and equivalent to ±8 Mbp around each significant marker were identified on chromosome 1 ( RL1 . 1 , RL1 . 2 , and RL1 . 3 ) and chromosome 6 ( RL6 . 1 , RL6 . 2 , and RL6 . 3; Figure 2B ) . Eighteen marker–trait associations identified by GWAS co-localized with these BSA regions of significance ( Supplementary file 1 , Table S4 ) including the most significant GWAS SNP on chromosome 1 at position 231264526 ( Figure 2A ) . Root growth is dependent on cell division and cell elongation activities occurring at the root tip . To identify the cellular process responsible for changes in root growth between the two parental lines , ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 , we used confocal microscopy to image and measure cell elongation in the root tip starting from the quiescent center ( Figure 2C , Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . While cell production rates were similar in both lines ( Figure 2D ) , SL2 ( fast growth line ) exhibited a significantly higher cell elongation rate than ICML-IS 11155 ( Figure 2E ) . Hence , the significant difference in root growth between inbred lines SL2 ( fast growth ) and ICML-IS 11155 ( slow growth ) was mainly driven by changes in root cell elongation . As differences in root growth between the two parent lines were mainly driven by cell elongation , we hypothesized that it might be linked to genes that are expressed in the root tip . We therefore profiled gene expression using RNAseq in the primary root tip ( 2 cm apex ) of inbred lines ICML-IS 11155 ( slow growth ) and SL2 ( fast growth ) . Reads were mapped to the coding DNA sequences ( CDSs ) predicted in the reference genome ( Varshney et al . , 2017 ) for expression analyses . 1778 genes showed significant differences in gene expression between the two contrasted lines using three combined statistical tests ( EdgeR , DESeq , and DESeq2 , p-value <0 . 01 ) . Unexpectedly , a large proportion of the reads ( 31 . 48% in average in the six RNAseq experiments ) did not map to predicted genes on the reference genome . When further analyzed , 15 . 15% of the unmapped reads ( with no correspondence to predicted CDS ) were found not to match the reference genome . These might correspond either to unsequenced regions or to genotype-specific genomic regions that are not present in the reference line . The remaining unmapped reads corresponded to either rRNA and tRNA genes ( 40 . 28% of the unmapped reads ) or to non-annotated genes or non-coding RNAs ( 44 . 57% of the unmapped reads ) . Hence , our transcriptomics analysis identified genes that are differentially expressed in the root tip of inbred lines ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 but revealed that some genes expressed in root tips are not annotated in the current version of the pearl millet genome . We re-analyzed a 1-Mbp genomic region on chromosome 1 around the most significant GWAS marker–trait association , corresponding to SNP chr1_231264526 , that co-localizes with a BSA QTL . This region contained a large proportion of unknown nucleotides ( 16 . 39% N ) thus making gene annotation difficult . To obtain better quality sequence information , long reads ( Nanopore technology , Yuan et al . , 2017 ) corresponding to the target QTL regions were recovered and re-annotated using structural and gene expression ( RNAseq ) data . Re-annotation revealed one novel 465 bp CDS , 1103 bp downstream of the significantly associated SNP ( chr1_231264526 , Figure 3A , B ) . This new CDS encodes a protein with strong homology to glutaredoxin ( GRX ) C9-like proteins from various cereals and was named PgGRXC9 . Two alleles at this locus exist in our population ( C or G ) with plants carrying a homozygous C/C allele ( 21 . 3% of the lines in our population ) having a significantly higher root growth than plants carrying the G/G homozygous allele ( 60 . 7% of the lines; Figure 3C ) . We found that PgGRXC9 expression was significantly higher in the root tip of the line carrying the allele associated with higher root growth ( C/C ) compared to the line carrying the lower growth allele ( G/G; Figure 3D ) . In situ hybridization using the RNAscope technology revealed expression in the stele and epidermis in the root tip and elongation zone ( Figure 3E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Expression was also observed in the columella cells of the root cap and in the stele of the differentiated part of the root ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We then used the RNAseq data to search for polymorphisms between the two contrasted parent lines used for BSA . No sequence polymorphisms were found in the predicted coding sequence of the gene between the two parent lines . However , two polymorphisms were detected in the 5′UTR region . Altogether , our results suggest that PgGRXC9 is a positive regulator of root growth and that a polymorphism in the promoter region of PgGRXC9 might led to changes in its expression level and ultimately to a quantitative difference in root growth between the two lines . However , the effect of the polymorphisms in the promoter on gene expression needs to be tested to validate this hypothesis . To test the hypothesis that changes in PgGRXC9 expression level are responsible for a change in root growth , we studied its ortholog in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana ( as functional genomic studies are not possible in pearl millet ) . The closest homolog in Arabidopsis was ROXY19 ( AT1G28480 ) with 56% identity at the protein level ( Figure 4A; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . The ROXY family is a land plant-specific family of GRX , with 21 members in Arabidopsis ( Meyer et al . , 2009 ) . They all harbor a Cys-Cys ( CC ) putative active site and bind to TGA type transcription factors via the C-terminal domain ( Meyer et al . , 2012 ) . Several of them contain a final ALWL C-terminal motif responsible for binding to TOPLESS and TOPLESS-related transcriptional co-repressors ( Uhrig et al . , 2017 ) . All these important amino acids were conserved in PgGRXC9 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . ROXY19 belongs to a subgroup of four ROXYs ( ROXY18-21 ) that contain a specific N-terminal domain of unknown function , that was also present in PgGRXC9 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Transcriptomic data indicate that ROXY19 is expressed in root tissues , with the strongest expression detected in the columella and stele of the elongation and maturation zone and some expression in the ground tissue and epidermis ( Belin et al . , 2015 ) . Given this expression profile was similar to PgGRXC9 in pearl millet , we exploited a roxy19 null mutant available in the Nossen ( No-0 ) background ( Huang et al . , 2016 ) to study its function . Strikingly , we observed that roxy19 had reduced primary root growth compared to its wild-type ecotype ( No-0; Figure 4B , C ) . Closer examination revealed that the defect in roxy19 root growth was due to a reduction in cell elongation ( Figure 4D ) , whereas cell production rate was similar in the mutant and wild type ( Figure 4E ) , thus mimicking the phenotype observed in pearl millet . Hence , our functional studies reveal that ROXY19 , the closest homolog of PgGRXC9 in A . thaliana , is a positive regulator of root growth through modulation of cell elongation . \n Pearl millet evolved and was domesticated in the Sahel . Its seeds are small ( 8 mg on average , about 5 and 20 times lighter than wheat or maize seeds , respectively , for example ) with limited reserves available for early seedling growth . It invests the available seed reserves toward the growth of a unique primary root to rapidly colonize deeper soil layers rather than forming more root axes ( seminal roots for example ) as seen in other cereals . Based on our results , we speculate that this specific early root development strategy was selected during evolution to cope with the specific rain pattern encountered in the Sahel . \n The panel of pearl millet inbred lines derived from West and Central African landraces ( open-pollinated varieties ) used in this study has been previously described ( Debieu et al . , 2018 ) . Nine lines from this panel that were contrasting for root length were selected for field trials ( Supplementary file 1 , Table S5 ) . Field experiments were performed at the CNRA station ( Centre National de Recherche Agronomique ) of the Institut Sénégalais des Recherches Agricoles ( ISRA ) in Bambey , Senegal ( 14 . 42°N , 16 . 28°W ) , during the dry season of 2018 and 2020 to fully control irrigation . Fields are composed of deep sandy soil with low levels of clay and silt ( 12% ) and organic matter ( 0 . 4% ) . Clay and silt content increase with soil depth from 10 . 2% in the 0–0 . 2 m layer to 13 . 3% in the 0 . 8–1 . 2 m layer . Experiments were set up using a complete randomized block design with 4 plots per variety , each composed of 6 rows of 6 . 3 m long with 0 . 9 m between plants and 0 . 9 m between rows ( 42 plants/plot ) . Irrigation was provided after sowing ( 30 mm of water ) to allow seeds to germinate and was followed by a period of 42 days of water withholding to impose seedling drought stress . Thinning was performed 15 days after sowing to conserve a single plant per planting hole . Fertilization ( NPK ) following standard recommendation of 150 kg ha−1 NPK ( 15-15-15 ) was applied to the entire trial after sowing and before irrigation . Fields were maintained free of weeds . Plant height was measured at 42 days after sowing . Stay-green trait expressed as the percentage of green leaves compared to the total number of leaves was estimated on 3 plants per plot at 42 days after sowing . Survival rate was measured as the percentage of surviving plants at 42 days after sowing in each plot compared to the initial number of plants that had emerged . Photosynthesis parameters ( FvFm: maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II and PI: performance index of photosynthesis ) were measured on three plants per plot at 32 days after sowing in both 2018 and 2020 using a Handy Pea chlorophyll fluorometer ( Hansatech Instruments Ltd ) . Long-term weather data ( 2000–2021 ) in CNRA ( Bambey , Senegal ) were gathered and analyzed to evaluate how the rainfall gap affects crop growth . An adapted version of the Simple Simulation Model ( SSM-iCrop , Soltani et al . , 2013; Soltani and Sinclair , 2012 ) was used to simulate the crop growth of a common West African pearl millet genotype ( Souna3 ) and dynamic of water in the soil . To test the effect of water limitation alone , the model was run in water-limited potential mode with 3 . 7 plants per m−2 density and no fertilizer limitation . From April 10 , the model began simulating soil water balance with a quarter-saturated profile . Sowing date was defined by the first significant rain of the year ( actual transpirable soil water superior or equal to 10 mm ) . Clustering was done based on the trend of the FTSW from sowing date to maturity in different years to group years into different stress patterns and the effect on the yield and biomass . The NbClust Package ( Charrad et al . , 2014 ) was used to determine the optimal number of clusters and the dynamic time warping method to cluster the daily simulated FTSW in different years . For high-throughput experiments ( association genetics and BSA ) , plants were phenotyped for primary root growth with a paper-based hydroponic system as previously described ( Passot et al . , 2016 ) . Seeds were surface sterilized and pre-germinated in Petri dishes , transferred into pouches 24 hr after germination at a density of 3 seeds per paper and then maintained in a growth room with a 14-hr photoperiod ( 28°C during day and 24°C during night ) . Pictures of the root systems were taken 6 DAG with a D5100 DSLR camera ( Nikon ) at a resolution of 16 M pixels . The camera was fixed on a holder to maintain the same distance between the lens and each root system . Primary root lengths were measured using RootNav ( Pound et al . , 2013 ) . Rhizotron experiments were performed as previously described ( Passot et al . , 2018 ) . For X-ray tomography , seeds were sterilized with 20% bleach for 5 min , then washed with sterilized water five times . Sterilized seeds were pre-germinated on moist sterilized filter paper for 36 hr at 28°C in a plant growth chamber ( 12-hr photoperiod and 300 µmol/m2/s light with 70% relative humidity ) . Equally germinated pearl millet seedlings ( 1 cm radicle length ) were gently placed in loamy sand soil in CT columns ( 30 cm height × 5 cm diameter ) . Loamy sand soil collected from the University of Nottingham farm at Bunny , Nottinghamshire , UK ( 52·52°N , 1·07°W ) was crushed thoroughly and sieved through 2-mm mesh size . These columns were saturated with water and then drained to field capacity . Five replicates of each SL2 and ICML-IS 11155 pearl millet seedlings were grown for 10 days for the CT experiment in a growth chamber maintained at a 12-hr photoperiod at 25°C and 250 µmol/m2/s light with 60% relative humidity . The root systems of 10-day-old pearl millet lines ( ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 ) were imaged non-destructively using a GE Phoenix v|tome|x M 240 kV X-ray tomography system ( GE Inspection Technologies , Wunstorf , Germany ) . Scans were acquired by collecting 3433 projection images at 140 kV X-ray energy , 200 µA current and 131ms detector exposure time at scan resolution of 45 µm in FAST mode ( 8-min total scan time ) . Three-dimensional image reconstruction was performed using Datos|REC software ( GE Inspection Technologies , Wunstorf , Germany ) and root length was measured using the polyline tool in VGStudioMax ( Volume Graphics GmbH , Germany ) . For Arabidopsis experiments , seeds were surface sterilized and placed on plates containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog ( 1/2 MS ) medium with 0 . 5 g l−1 2-morpholineethanesulfonic acid ( MES ) and 0 . 8% ( wt/vol ) plant agar without sucrose . All plates were incubated vertically at 20°C with 160 µE m−2 s−1 light intensity and a 16-hr light/8-hr dark regime . The primary root elongation rate was quantified between days 8 and 17 . Lengths were quantified from pictures using the public domain image analysis program ImageJ 1 . 52i ( https://imagej . nih . gov/ij/ ) and its NeuronJ plugin . Broad sense heritability was computed with the following formula:H2=Var ( line ) Var ( line ) +Var ( res ) nplant/line , where Both variances are parameters of the following linear mixed model:Length=μ+αline+εres , where μ is the overall mean length , αline is the random effect attached to the lines with αline ∼ N ( 0 , Var ( line ) ) , and εres is the error term with εres ∼ N ( 0 , Var ( res ) ) . Genotyping by sequencing of the panel of inbred lines was reported in previous work ( Debieu et al . , 2018 ) . In order to conduct association mapping , we first estimated population structure based on the ancestry coefficients estimated with the R package LEA v2 . 0 . Then , GWAS was performed using LFMM 2 . 0 which corrects for unobserved population confounders and considers ridge estimates ( Caye et al . , 2019 ) . Given the reduced number of lines , GWAS was performed using four other methods for association analysis: ANOVA , EMMA ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) , MLM ( Yu et al . , 2006 ) , and a previous version of LFMM ( Frichot et al . , 2013 ) . The median heterozygosity for the inbred lines was low at 5 . 6% . Each heterozygous site was randomly fixed for the reference or the alternate allele . Root growth in F2 seedlings derived from the cross between ICML-IS 11155 and SL-2 ( low and high primary root growth , respectively ) was characterized in the paper phenotyping system as described above . The 10% extreme lines in the tails of the distribution were selected to form the bulks of contrasted lines . Leaf discs ( 1 . 5 mm diameter ) were sampled for each line during the phenotyping experiment and stored at −80°C . Leaf discs from selected lines were pooled together to make the high root growth ( H ) and low root growth ( L ) bulks for DNA extraction . Genomic DNA was isolated for each bulk using the MATAB method as previously described ( Mariac et al . , 2006 ) . DNA libraries were constructed from genomic DNA fragmented by acoustic shearing ( Bioruptor ) with a peak fragment target size of 200–300 bp . Sheared DNA was end-repaired using a T4 polymerase ( End Repair NEB ) and bound with the P5 and PE-P7 sequencing adaptors ( Rohland and Reich , 2012 ) . A combination of unique oligonucleotides barcode sequences was ligated to the P5 adaptor to index the DNA libraries derived from each bulk ( H and L ) and from the parental lines of the cross . Then , equimolar amounts of each DNA library were combined in the genomic DNA bank for the cross . Subsequently , the DNA bank library was hybridized with biotinylated RNA probes or ‘baits’ ( myBaits ) targeting the first 500 bp of the 32 , 100 pearl millet predicted genes . Finally , high-throughput sequencing of the enriched DNA library was performed on an Illumina HiSeq sequencer by Novogene Company Limited ( HK ) . Initial sequencing quality checks using FastQC version 0 . 11 . 5 ( Andrews , 2010 ) were followed by trimming and quality filter steps on which adaptors , barcode sequences , and low-quality reads ( <35 bp ) were removed . Filtered reads were aligned to the pearl millet reference genome ( Varshney et al . , 2017 ) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignmen tool ( BWA version 0 . 7 . 17 r1188; Li and Durbin , 2009 ) . Reads mapping at the target enriched regions were used for SNP calling using the UnifiedGenotyper algorithm from GATK 3 . 7 ( McKenna et al . , 2010 ) with the parameter down-sampling limit ( dcov ) set at 9000 . Multi-allelic sites and those with low total allele frequency ( AF <0 . 25 ) were removed . In addition , sites with either low or high total sequencing depth ( below the 25th and above the 95th percentiles , respectively ) were removed . Finally , SNPs with more than 50% missing data and minor allele frequency under 5% were excluded . For bulk segregant study , only biallelic SNP variants of the bulks that were present in the parental lines of the cross were kept . The line ICML-IS 11155 ( low primary root growth ) was used as the reference genome for the cross to designate the alternate and reference SNP variants in the bulks . Out of the range of statistical approaches for measuring the differences in allele frequency in BSA , Euclidean distance-based statistics as suggested by Hill et al . , 2013 was selected based on a preliminary study on which we tested the efficiency of the methods for QTL detection using simulations ( de la Fuente Cantó and Vigouroux , 2022 ) . The Euclidean distance between allele frequencies of the bulks at each marker position ( EDm ) was calculated as follows:EDm=faL-fAL2+faH-fAH2 where fa and fA correspond to the allele frequency of the alternate and reference allele in the low bulk ( L ) and the high bulk ( H ) , respectively . Then , to reduce the effect of sequencing noise and increase the signal of the differences in allele frequency we calculated the fourth power of the cumulative EDm value in windows of 100 consecutive markers ( Omboki et al . , 2018; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . The confidence interval of the statistic was determined using simulations as described in de la Fuente Cantó and Vigouroux , 2022 . Seeds were surface sterilized and germinated in Petri dishes containing wet filter paper for 24 hr in the dark at 27°C . After 2 days , plants were transferred to hydroponic tanks containing 1/4 Hoagland solution and grown for 15 days at 27°C . RNA was extracted from the root tip ( 2 cm apex ) of the primary root using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) . RNAseq was performed by the Montpellier GenomiX Platform ( MGX , https://www . mgx . cnrs . fr/ ) . Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 . Analyses were performed as previously described ( de la Fuente Cantó and Vigouroux , 2022 ) . Three different statistical tests were used to identify differentially expressed genes: EdgeR ( McCarthy et al . , 2012; Robinson et al . , 2010 ) , DESeq ( Anders and Huber , 2010 ) , and DESeq2 ( Love et al . , 2014 ) . GO terms enrichment was performed in the 1778 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the slow and fast growth lines according to the three statistical tests using the TopGO package in R . Briefly , overrepresentation of GO terms in the list of differentially expressed genes ( 1032 of the 1778 with GO annotations ) was investigated in relation to the list of annotated pearl millet genes with GO annotations ( 16 , 620 genes with GO annotations and 47 , 234 GO terms in total; Varshney et al . , 2017 ) using a Fisher test . Each GO category was tested independently or considering hierarchical links between GO terms . GO terms showing p-values below 0 . 01 were further considered for enrichment analysis . Root meristem phenotype of lines with contrasted primary root length was characterized using confocal microscopy . Lines ICML-IS 11155 and SL-2 ( low and high primary root growth , respectively ) were grown in paper rolls under controlled conditions in a growth room . In brief , pre-germinated seeds were sown along the long side of germination paper ( Anchor Paper Company , USA ) rolled on itself and imbibed in ¼ strength Hoagland solution ( Hoagland and Arnon , 1950 ) . Each paper roll was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 ml of nutrient solution , a volume maintained constant throughout the experiment . Primary root length was measured , and 2 cm length were sampled from the tip of 1-week-old seedlings . Root tips were fixed in FAA solution for 24 hr . Then , root tips were washed twice in PBS solution and moved to the ClearSee clearing ( Kurihara et al . , 2015 ) solution for a minimum of 48 hr . Before imaging , root tips were stained for 30 min in 0 . 1% Calcofluor White and washed in ClearSee for other 30 min ( protocol adapted from Ursache et al . , 2018 ) . Root tip images were obtained using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a ×20/0 . 70 dry objective at a detection range of 420–485 nm . Images were analyzed using the Broadly Applicable Routines for ImageJ ( Ferreira et al . , 2015 ) . Cell walls from the meta-xylem vessel were used to estimate cell length along the axial axis of the root . The ‘find peaks’ option was used to determine the coordinates of the cell walls along a segmented line traced from the quiescent center to the mature zone where the first root hairs were observed , and maximum cell length was reached . Consecutive data points defined the cell length along the root axis and a logistic function was fitted to the data to characterize axial root growth ( Morris and Silk , 1992 ) . Elongation rate was estimated as the root length reached per day of experiment . This value divided by the maximum cell elongation defined per sample was used to approximate the cell production value or number of cells produced in the meristem per day assuming steady-state growth ( Beemster et al . , 2002 ) . Long reads were used to reannotate the QTL region as in Grondin et al . , 2020 ( Genbank accessions MT474864 and MT474865 ) . For identification of Nanopore contigs corresponding to the QTL region , a 1-MB sequence located around the most significant GWAS SNP was extracted from the reference genome and aligned to the long-read genome using the nucmer tool ( MUMmer version 4 . 0 . 0beta2 , - -mum option Marçais et al . , 2018 ) with a minimum aligned sequence length of 300 bp . We pre-selected contigs alignments if at least five regions of the same contig were aligned successively to the QTL region in a span shorter than 20 kb and covering at least 3% of the QTL sequence . Contigs were considered as valid if the alignment covered at least 40% of the contig length and 20% of the QTL length . For annotation , a de novo transposable elements ( TEs ) library was generated from the long reads with RepeatModeler2 ( version 2 . 0 . 1 , options -engine ncbi; Flynn et al . , 2020 ) . TEs were detected and removed using RepeatMasker ( version 4 . 1 . 0; Tarailo-Graovac and Chen , 2009 ) with the de novo TEs library . Annotation of the genome was performed with MAKER2 ( version 2 . 31 . 9; Holt and Yandell , 2011 ) using all ESTs sequences downloaded from the NCBI ( organisms: P . glaucum , Oryza sativa , Zea mays , Sorghum bicolor , P . miliaceum , and Setaria italica ) , all protein sequences of P . glaucum available on the NCBI ( July 2020 ) , all protein sequences of annotated genes on the reference genome ( http://gigadb . org/dataset/100192 ) and the Uniprot-Swiss-Prot protein database ( section viridiplantae , release-2020_06 ) . RNAseq data mapping was performed with TOGGLe v3 ( Tranchant-Dubreuil et al . , 2018 ) . Reads were aligned to the long-read sequences with HISAT2 version 2 . 0 . 1 ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) and an annotation file was produced with Stringtie version 1 . 3 . 4 ( Pertea et al . , 2015 ) . This file was used as input of MAKER2 ( default parameters , the SNAP HMM O . sativa file model ) . Predicted protein sequences were aligned to the Uniprot-Swiss-Prot protein database ( section viridiplantae ) using blastx ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . Genes with protein domain signatures were recovered using Pfam database and InterProScan version 5 . 19-58 . 0 ( -appl pfam -dp -f TSV -goterms -iprlookup -pa -t p; Mulder and Apweiler , 2007 ) . Pearl millet root tip fixation , embedding , and sectioning step were performed as described in Mounier et al . , 2020 . Briefly , 7-day-old millet primary root tip ( 1 . 5 cm ) were hand-dissected and the tip were immediately aligned between two biopsy foam ( M476-1 , Simport , Canada ) , and transferred in a cassette ( 1 , 267 , 796 Thermo Scientific , USA ) in a 3:1 ethanol:acetic acid fixative solution . The samples were then placed in a fresh fixative solution and a 5-min vacuum was applied two times . The solution was then replaced by a fresh fixative solution and samples were stored over-night at 4°C . The samples were then subjected to several 5 min baths with increasing ethanol concentrations ( 75 , 80 , 85 , 90 , 95 , and 100% ) , one bath in an ethanol/butanol ( 1:1 ) solution and one bath in absolute butanol on ice . The samples were transferred to a water bath at 54°C inside of a histology microwave oven ( Histos 5 Rapid Tissue Processor , Milestone , Italy ) . The samples were then subjected to a bath in butanol/paraffin ( 1:1 ) solution at 54°C and 300 W and then two baths in paraffin at 54°C and 250 W . Prior to the embedding step , the root bundles were rapidly removed from the cassettes while the paraffin was still liquid and transferred to a cold RNase-free surface . The bundles were subsequently transferred vertically and placed upside down in a molding tray ( E70182 , EMS , USA ) . The paraffin blocks were maintained at 4°C and protected from light . Transversal sections with a thickness of 8 μm were cut on an RNase-free microtome ( RM2255 , Leica , Germany ) and mounted on a cut edge frosted glass slide ( VWR , 631-1551 ) prewarmed at 45°C with drops of RNase-free water . Slides were then baked at 60°C until the section was well fixed on the slide ( around 20 min ) prior to RNAscope . The RNAscope assay was performed by Be More Specific . Probes against PgGRXC9 were custom designed by ACD and are available in the ACD catalogue as Came-GRXC9-C1 ( Ref . 1187801-C1 ) . The probes were designed based on the PgGRXC9 re-annotated sequence and were complementary to nucleotides at positions 71–671 , excluding the 398–510 positions . The negative probe was provided by ACD ( Accession # EF191515 ) . The in situ hybridization assay was performed using the ACD RNAscope 2 . 5 HD Detection Reagent-RED kit ( cat . no . 322360 ) using the provided protocol ( http://www . acdbio . com/technical-support/user-manuals ) . Imaging of tissue sections was performed using a Nikon Eclipse NI-E ( Nikon Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) with a 40X Plan Apo λ 0 . 95 NA objectives . Images were processed using imageJ contrast enhancement tool to 0 . 001% of saturated pixel . Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4 . 0 . 2 5 ( R Development Core Team , 2018 ) . Principal component analyses were performed using the prcomp ( ) function . Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed using the corr ( ) function within the ggcorrplot package . The variance of each variable was partitioned into components attributable to the genotypic ( line ) and year in interaction with block as additional factor using an ANOVA ( aov ( ) function in the agricolae package ) . Adjusted means of the variables for the different lines across the two experiments were further calculated using the least-squares means lsmeans ( ) function ( lsmeans package ) .",

         "Seedling root traits impact plant establishment under challenging environments . Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region . Pearl millet’s early root system features a single fast-growing primary root which we hypothesize is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate . Using crop modeling , we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated . Furthermore , we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions . Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci  approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait . Combining gene expression data , re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator . In summary , our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment . Pearl millet was domesticated about 4500 years ago in the Sahelian part of West Africa  and is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops  . However , in Africa , pearl millet yield remains low compared to its genetic potential because it is mostly cultivated in marginal lands in low-input and rainfed agricultural systems and the development and adoption of improved varieties is still limited  . The plant root system is responsible for water and nutrient acquisition from the soil . Breeding for root traits that could improve the crop root system efficiency has been proposed as one of the pillars of a second green revolution  . This strategy relies on the selection of root traits suitable for the specific characteristics of the target environment such as soil and climate but also agricultural practices  . It requires a better understanding of stress patterns and the performance of individual root traits in real conditions and in response to different constraints . However , only a few studies have addressed the importance of individual root traits in field conditions . Primary root development is an important contributor to seedling vigor and greatly influences plant establishment  . Pearl millet embryonic root system development is characterized by the formation of a fast-growing primary root that is the only architectural component of the root system for the first 6 days after germination   . No seminal roots are present in pearl millet and crown and lateral roots were only observed 6 DAG  . We hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment  . Here , we show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet . Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation . Functional characterization of the closest homolog in Arabidopsis reveals a new role for GRX in the regulation of root growth through cell elongation in the root apical meristem . We previously hypothesized that the fast-growing primary root might be an adaptation to the Sahelian environment and , in particular , to early cycle drought stress episodes  . To analyze the frequency and impact of such early drought stress , we first studied meteorological data collected for the past 21 years  at the CNRA Bambey station , located at the center of the pearl millet growing region of Senegal and highly representative of the climate found in Sahelian West Africa . Crops such as pearl millet are traditionally sown before or shortly after the first rain event of the rainy season . A crop model was parameterized using soil and meteorological data  from the Bambey experimental station to determine when pearl millet faced drought stress and predict its impact on crop yield . Using a widely cultivated variety of pearl millet  for modeling , we simulated the daily fraction of transpirable soil water  profiles in different years to identify periods of the growth cycle when access to water was limiting . 3 was considered a stressful condition as it is the value below which transpiration rate in pearl millet starts to drop due to insufficient water supply from the root to support transpiration  . Clustering the trend of FTSW in the 21 years studied  revealed three stress patterns: early-stress , late-stress , and no-stress  . The crop faced early stress at a frequency of 24% over the 21 years , which resulted in an average 43% grain yield penalty compared to years without stress . Hence , our analysis confirms that early drought episodes are a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems of West Africa affecting crops during the vegetative stage . In order to test if a fast-growing primary root after germination might be an adaptive trait to early drought stress , we first phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the genetic diversity of the crop  . As primary root growth is linear in the first days of growth  , root length was measured as a proxy of growth on a paper-based hydroponic system 6 DAG in 122 pearl millet inbred lines  . Primary root length ranged from 21 . The importance of early root growth for plant tolerance to early drought stress was then evaluated in field trials in 2 independent years using nine inbred lines with contrasted root growth  . Irrigation was then stopped to mimic an early drought stress episode and plant growth and ecophysiological parameters were analyzed for the following 6 weeks  . We then analyzed the correlations between primary root length , measured in the lab , and plant performance measured in field conditions . Principal component analyses revealed a covariation of early primary root growth and stay-green  as well as the performance index of photosynthesis  measured both in 2018 and 2020  . Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage , an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress  . Hence , our field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination . We next studied the genetic determinants of primary root growth in pearl millet . First , the heritability of early primary root growth was analyzed using our paper-based phenotyping data on the panel of inbred lines . 53 was computed indicating that early primary root growth is under strong genetic control in pearl millet . Genotyping by sequencing of the panel of pearl millet inbred lines provided 392 , 493 single nucleotide polymorphisms  for association , after filtering on quality , with an average density of 2 . Our analysis revealed a total of 447 significant SNPs across the pearl millet genome associated with primary root growth from which , 109 SNPs were found highly significant with at least two other methods for association analysis at p-value <10−4  . To validate our GWAS analysis , we generated a bi-parental population from two inbred lines with contrasting early primary root growth . The two lines , ICML-IS 11155  and SL2  , were selected based on our initial paper-based root phenotyping experiment . The difference in primary root growth between these two lines was confirmed 7 DAG in a paper roll phenotyping system  , as well as in soil using X-ray microCT 10 DAG  , thus demonstrating their contrasting primary root phenotypes were robust and independent of the experimental system . Lines SL2 and ICML-IS 11155 were crossed and 737 F2 plants were phenotyped for early root growth together with their parents  . After filtering , a group of 33 , 582 SNP variants  identified between the bulks was used to assess the differences in allele frequency linked to the root length phenotype . Eighteen marker–trait associations identified by GWAS co-localized with these BSA regions of significance  including the most significant GWAS SNP on chromosome 1 at position 231264526  . Root growth is dependent on cell division and cell elongation activities occurring at the root tip . To identify the cellular process responsible for changes in root growth between the two parental lines , ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 , we used confocal microscopy to image and measure cell elongation in the root tip starting from the quiescent center  . While cell production rates were similar in both lines  , SL2  exhibited a significantly higher cell elongation rate than ICML-IS 11155  . Hence , the significant difference in root growth between inbred lines SL2  and ICML-IS 11155  was mainly driven by changes in root cell elongation . As differences in root growth between the two parent lines were mainly driven by cell elongation , we hypothesized that it might be linked to genes that are expressed in the root tip . We therefore profiled gene expression using RNAseq in the primary root tip  of inbred lines ICML-IS 11155  and SL2  . 1778 genes showed significant differences in gene expression between the two contrasted lines using three combined statistical tests  . Hence , our transcriptomics analysis identified genes that are differentially expressed in the root tip of inbred lines ICML-IS 11155 and SL2 but revealed that some genes expressed in root tips are not annotated in the current version of the pearl millet genome . We re-analyzed a 1-Mbp genomic region on chromosome 1 around the most significant GWAS marker–trait association , corresponding to SNP chr1_231264526 , that co-localizes with a BSA QTL . To obtain better quality sequence information , long reads  corresponding to the target QTL regions were recovered and re-annotated using structural and gene expression  data . Two alleles at this locus exist in our population  with plants carrying a homozygous C/C allele  having a significantly higher root growth than plants carrying the G/G homozygous allele  . We found that PgGRXC9 expression was significantly higher in the root tip of the line carrying the allele associated with higher root growth  compared to the line carrying the lower growth allele  . In situ hybridization using the RNAscope technology revealed expression in the stele and epidermis in the root tip and elongation zone  . Expression was also observed in the columella cells of the root cap and in the stele of the differentiated part of the root  . Altogether , our results suggest that PgGRXC9 is a positive regulator of root growth and that a polymorphism in the promoter region of PgGRXC9 might led to changes in its expression level and ultimately to a quantitative difference in root growth between the two lines . To test the hypothesis that changes in PgGRXC9 expression level are responsible for a change in root growth , we studied its ortholog in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana  . Transcriptomic data indicate that ROXY19 is expressed in root tissues , with the strongest expression detected in the columella and stele of the elongation and maturation zone and some expression in the ground tissue and epidermis  . Given this expression profile was similar to PgGRXC9 in pearl millet , we exploited a roxy19 null mutant available in the Nossen  background  to study its function . Strikingly , we observed that roxy19 had reduced primary root growth compared to its wild-type ecotype  . Closer examination revealed that the defect in roxy19 root growth was due to a reduction in cell elongation  , whereas cell production rate was similar in the mutant and wild type  , thus mimicking the phenotype observed in pearl millet . thaliana , is a positive regulator of root growth through modulation of cell elongation . Pearl millet evolved and was domesticated in the Sahel . It invests the available seed reserves toward the growth of a unique primary root to rapidly colonize deeper soil layers rather than forming more root axes  as seen in other cereals . Based on our results , we speculate that this specific early root development strategy was selected during evolution to cope with the specific rain pattern encountered in the Sahel . The panel of pearl millet inbred lines derived from West and Central African landraces  used in this study has been previously described  . Nine lines from this panel that were contrasting for root length were selected for field trials  . Irrigation was provided after sowing  to allow seeds to germinate and was followed by a period of 42 days of water withholding to impose seedling drought stress . Stay-green trait expressed as the percentage of green leaves compared to the total number of leaves was estimated on 3 plants per plot at 42 days after sowing . Photosynthesis parameters  were measured on three plants per plot at 32 days after sowing in both 2018 and 2020 using a Handy Pea chlorophyll fluorometer  . An adapted version of the Simple Simulation Model  was used to simulate the crop growth of a common West African pearl millet genotype  and dynamic of water in the soil . For high-throughput experiments  , plants were phenotyped for primary root growth with a paper-based hydroponic system as previously described  . Seeds were surface sterilized and pre-germinated in Petri dishes , transferred into pouches 24 hr after germination at a density of 3 seeds per paper and then maintained in a growth room with a 14-hr photoperiod  . Pictures of the root systems were taken 6 DAG with a D5100 DSLR camera  at a resolution of 16 M pixels . The camera was fixed on a holder to maintain the same distance between the lens and each root system . Primary root lengths were measured using RootNav  . Sterilized seeds were pre-germinated on moist sterilized filter paper for 36 hr at 28°C in a plant growth chamber  . Equally germinated pearl millet seedlings  were gently placed in loamy sand soil in CT columns  . Five replicates of each SL2 and ICML-IS 11155 pearl millet seedlings were grown for 10 days for the CT experiment in a growth chamber maintained at a 12-hr photoperiod at 25°C and 250 µmol/m2/s light with 60% relative humidity . The root systems of 10-day-old pearl millet lines  were imaged non-destructively using a GE Phoenix v|tome|x M 240 kV X-ray tomography system  . Three-dimensional image reconstruction was performed using Datos|REC software  and root length was measured using the polyline tool in VGStudioMax  . The primary root elongation rate was quantified between days 8 and 17 . Broad sense heritability was computed with the following formula:H2=Var  Var  +Var  nplant/line , where Both variances are parameters of the following linear mixed model:Length=μ+αline+εres , where μ is the overall mean length , αline is the random effect attached to the lines with αline ∼ N ( 0 , Var  ) , and εres is the error term with εres ∼ N ( 0 , Var  ) . Root growth in F2 seedlings derived from the cross between ICML-IS 11155 and SL-2  was characterized in the paper phenotyping system as described above . Leaf discs from selected lines were pooled together to make the high root growth  and low root growth  bulks for DNA extraction . Subsequently , the DNA bank library was hybridized with biotinylated RNA probes or ‘baits’  targeting the first 500 bp of the 32 , 100 pearl millet predicted genes . Filtered reads were aligned to the pearl millet reference genome  using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignmen tool  . The line ICML-IS 11155  was used as the reference genome for the cross to designate the alternate and reference SNP variants in the bulks . The Euclidean distance between allele frequencies of the bulks at each marker position  was calculated as follows:EDm=faL-fAL2+faH-fAH2 where fa and fA correspond to the allele frequency of the alternate and reference allele in the low bulk  and the high bulk  , respectively . RNA was extracted from the root tip  of the primary root using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit  . GO terms enrichment was performed in the 1778 genes that were significantly differentially expressed between the slow and fast growth lines according to the three statistical tests using the TopGO package in R . Briefly , overrepresentation of GO terms in the list of differentially expressed genes  was investigated in relation to the list of annotated pearl millet genes with GO annotations  using a Fisher test . Root meristem phenotype of lines with contrasted primary root length was characterized using confocal microscopy . Lines ICML-IS 11155 and SL-2  were grown in paper rolls under controlled conditions in a growth room . Primary root length was measured , and 2 cm length were sampled from the tip of 1-week-old seedlings . Root tips were fixed in FAA solution for 24 hr . Then , root tips were washed twice in PBS solution and moved to the ClearSee clearing  solution for a minimum of 48 hr . Before imaging , root tips were stained for 30 min in 0 . Root tip images were obtained using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a ×20/0 . Cell walls from the meta-xylem vessel were used to estimate cell length along the axial axis of the root . The ‘find peaks’ option was used to determine the coordinates of the cell walls along a segmented line traced from the quiescent center to the mature zone where the first root hairs were observed , and maximum cell length was reached . Consecutive data points defined the cell length along the root axis and a logistic function was fitted to the data to characterize axial root growth  . Elongation rate was estimated as the root length reached per day of experiment . This value divided by the maximum cell elongation defined per sample was used to approximate the cell production value or number of cells produced in the meristem per day assuming steady-state growth  . For identification of Nanopore contigs corresponding to the QTL region , a 1-MB sequence located around the most significant GWAS SNP was extracted from the reference genome and aligned to the long-read genome using the nucmer tool  with a minimum aligned sequence length of 300 bp . Pearl millet root tip fixation , embedding , and sectioning step were performed as described in Mounier et al . Briefly , 7-day-old millet primary root tip  were hand-dissected and the tip were immediately aligned between two biopsy foam  , and transferred in a cassette  in a 3:1 ethanol:acetic acid fixative solution . Prior to the embedding step , the root bundles were rapidly removed from the cassettes while the paraffin was still liquid and transferred to a cold RNase-free surface . "
