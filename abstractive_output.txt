To investigate this question , the researchers used a technique called X-ray crystallography to examine the structure of heart muscle cells . The X-ray crystall

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the movement of the brain . The disease is caused by faulty connections between neurons in the brain’s main axis . These connections are known as neuromodulators , which are responsible for controlling the activity of the neurons in the main axis . However , it is not clear how the neuromodulators affect the activity of the neurons in the main axis . One possibility is that the neuromodulators control the activity of the neurons in the main axis by controlling the activity of the neurons in the striatum , a region of the brain

The muscles and tendons that connect the body to the outside world are made of proteins called collagens . These proteins are made by cells called fibroblasts , which attach to the surface of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , a thin membrane that surrounds the cell .

Previous studies have shown that the uv1 neuroendocrine cells also sense the contractions of the vulval muscles and release tyramine to prevent the egg from being

Microbial communities contain hundreds of different types of bacteria , fungi , and other microbes . These communities can be found in many different environments , including the human gut , the ocean , and the human microbiome . However , the diversity of these communities can also be affected by seasonal variations . For example , in the human gut , the bacteria that live in the gut are more likely to be found in the summer , whereas the bacteria that live in the ocean are more likely to be found in the winter . This seasonal variation can also affect the diversity of the human microbiome .

Tactile touch is an essential part of everyday life , and it is essential for people to be able to move their fingers and to grasp objects . However , it is not possible to fully restore the ability to touch objects with a prosthetic hand , and it is not clear how to do so in real-time .

The ability to avoid obstacles is one of the most important aspects of animal behavior , and it has been suggested that the brain plays an important role in helping animals to avoid obstacles . However , it is not clear how the brain processes this information . To investigate this question , a group of researchers studied the brain of a pigeon , which has neurons in the nucleus rotundus , a region of the brain that is known to be involved in vision . The pigeons were trained to avoid obstacles by moving their left leg to the side of the obstacle , and then moving their right leg to the side of

The human spinal cord is one of the largest networks of nerve cells in the body , and is responsible for movement , balance and coordination . However , it is not well understood how the spinal cord and the brain work together in a resting state . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) is one of the most powerful methods for mapping human brain function . It uses a technique called blood oxygenation level dependent contrast , or BOLD for short , to measure the electrical activity in the brain . This technique is particularly powerful in the human spinal cord , where it can reveal patterns of low-frequency

When a cell divides , it needs to be able to move its daughter cells in the right direction . To do this , the daughter cells must be able to move along a structure called the mitotic spindle . This spindle is made up of a series of filaments called astral microtubules , which are wrapped around a protein called dynein . The astral microtubules help the daughter cells to move along the mitotic spindle . However , it is not clear exactly how the astral microtubules help the daughter cells to move along the mitotic spindle . To investigate this question , researchers

Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD for short ) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in the world . It is characterized by obsessive-compulsive behaviors , such as compulsive thoughts and compulsive behavior , which are often accompanied by anxiety and depression . However , it is not clear why OCD is more common than other psychiatric disorders .

Muscles are made up of many different types of cells , including muscle stem cells , muscle fibers , and muscle neurons . During development , these cells divide to produce new muscle cells , which then divide to produce new muscle fibers . However , when a muscle is injured , these muscle stem cells die , and the muscle fibers become damaged . This leads to the formation of new muscle fibers , which are then used to repair the damaged muscle . However , it is not clear how the loss of these muscle stem cells leads to the formation of new muscle fibers . A protein

Aging and neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease , are caused by mutations in a gene called PSEN1 . This gene encodes a protein called sel-12 , which is found in all mammals , including humans . Mutations in PSEN1 can lead to neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease , in which the mitochondria in the brain and spinal cord become damaged and die . Previous studies have shown that sel-12 mutant animals show abnormal changes in the structure of their mitochondria as they age . However

The pre-mRNA is then copied to make a second RNA molecule called a

When a cell divides , it needs to move between other cells to form a new cell . To do this , the cell needs to attach to a protein called focal adhesion molecule ( or FA for short ) , which is found at the front of the cell . As the cell moves forward over an FA , the force vector is redirected and the FA remodels or disassembles , allowing the FA proteins to recycle through the cytosol for reuse at the leading edge of the cell . However , it is not clear how this process works . Previous studies have shown that FAs at the front of

The membranes that surround cells are made up of molecules called phospholipids , which are made up of fatty acids . The phospholipids are made up of two types of fatty acids: docosahexaenoic acid ( or DHA for short ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( or FA for short ) . These two types of fatty acids are essential for the membrane to be flexible and permeable . However , docosahexaenoic acid and FA make membranes more rigid than docosahexaenoic acid and less permeable than docosahexaenoic acid . Therefore , it is important

The ultraviolet ( UV ) light that is emitted from the sun reflects off the surface of the insect’s body , which is then reflected back into the air . This is known as UV reflection , and it is thought that the insect’s ability to perceive UV light also plays important roles in its mate recognition , in male–male competition , and in other ecological characteristics such as habitat selection and behavioral differences . However , it is not clear how the insect’s UV-reflective surface wax , which is made up of molecules called methyl ketones , is produced . To address this question

The human gut is home to trillions of bacteria that help to digest food , synthesize essential vitamins and amino acids , and perform other important roles in the body . However , it has been known for decades that some bacteria in the gut reduce the amount of a drug called digoxin , which is found in many drugs , to a metabolite called dihydrodigoxin . This reduces the drug’s effectiveness and toxicity , but it is not clear exactly how the bacteria do this . To address this question , a group of researchers used a combination of techniques to study the genomes of human gut bacteria

The River Cam is a major source of drinking water in the UK , but it is also one of the most polluted rivers in the world . This is partly because of the large number of bacteria that live in the water , and partly because of the fact that many of these bacteria are known to contribute to nutrient pollution from wastewater treatment plants . To better understand how the River Cam is affected by pollution , researchers at the University of Bristol have used a new technology called MinION to sequence the DNA of all the bacteria that live in the river . MinION uses a technique called nanopore shotgun-sequencing

However , there are several drugs that have been tested in animal models of the disease , and they have shown promising results

Genes are molecules of DNA that are transcribed into messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules , which are then used to make proteins . When a gene is expressed , the mRNA molecules are translated into proteins , which are then used to make new proteins . This process is known as gene regulation , and it is important to understand how genes are regulated . Gene regulation can be measured using a technique called ‘Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis’ ( DTA ) , which uses nonperturbing metabolic RNA labeling to obtain the amounts of newly synthesized mRNA , which can be used as a proxy for gene activity

The queen of a colony of bees , for example , is the queen of the colony , which means that she is the queen of the colony . When the queen has mated several times , her offspring are more likely to be non-reproductive than her offspring . This means that the queen is less likely to help the colony . However , if the queen has mated several times , her offspring are more likely to be non-reproductive than her offspring . This means that the queen is less likely to help the colony . However , if the queen has mated several times ,

One possibility is that the first human-chimpanzee ancestor , Australopithecus

Male mice , like all animals , have two sets of chromosomes , one for each sex . However , in some cases , the two sets of chromosomes are not identical , and this can lead to male mice becoming infertile . This is because the two sets of chromosomes do not share the same sequence of DNA , and so the two sets of chromosomes do not share the same sequence of DNA . This means that the two sets of chromosomes do not share the same sequence of DNA , and so the two sets of chromosomes do not share the same sequence of DNA . This means that the two

Cochlear cells contain two types of hair cells , called OHCs and Deiters . The OHCs respond to sounds at frequencies that exceed the low-pass corner frequency of their cell membranes . However , OHCs must respond to sounds at frequencies that exceed the high-pass corner frequency of their cell membranes . This means that OHCs must be large enough to be effective up to high frequencies , even though the membrane capacitance is expected to reduce the AC receptor potentials at a rate of 6 dB per octave . This means that OHCs must be large enough to

Blood flow in the brain is highly sensitive to changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the blood . When the concentration of CO2 in the blood increases , blood vessels in the brain constrict . This constricts the flow of blood to the brain , which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood . However , it is not clear how this process works . Previous studies have shown that neurons in a region of the brain called the retrotrapezoid nucleus ( RTN ) are sensitive to changes in CO2 . This region contains a subset of neurons that are

The cell division cycle is a process in which a cell divides into two or more different types of cells .

The most commonly used antimicrobials for treating enteric fever are ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin . However , some strains of Salmonella Typhi have evolved resistance to these antimicrobials , which means that

The human genome contains the genetic information needed to make proteins and other molecules . The human genome contains two sets of chromosomes , one called the X chromosome and the other called the Y chromosome . The X chromosome contains the genes needed to make proteins and other molecules , while the Y chromosome contains the genes needed to make sex hormones . The loss of one copy of the Y chromosome is predicted to result in a two-fold reduction in the expression of genes on the Y chromosome , as gene expression is correlated with gene copy number . This can cause imbalances in gene networks composed of both X/Z-linked and

Blood flow in the brain is regulated by the flow of oxygen and nutrients into and out of the brain . However , if a blood vessel in the brain becomes blocked , the flow of oxygen and nutrients into and out of the brain can be disrupted . This can lead to microinfarcts , which are lesions in the brain caused by a blockage of blood flow . These microinfarcts can occur even at the level of individual blood vessels , which is known as the ‘bottleneck’ of blood flow . However , it is difficult to study microinfarcts in animals

The plant is known for its ability to adapt to changing temperatures , and vernalization , the process by which plants start to flower in the spring , is one of the most important steps in this process . However , it is not well understood how vernalization works . Previous studies have shown that Arabidopsis plants that are collected from northern Europe and southern Africa are more likely to flower in the spring than plants that are collected from northern Europe and southern Africa .

Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin , a hormone that helps to regulate blood sugar levels . Insulin is produced in the pancreas , but it is also found in the liver , kidneys and other organs . In humans , this hormone is produced in the liver , pancreas and other organs , but it is not produced in the blood . This means that people with diabetes are more likely to have high blood sugar levels , which can lead to weight gain , heart disease , and other health problems . However , it is not clear exactly how insulin is produced

Neurons in the brain communicate with each other by forming connections called synapses . These connections are made up of two groups of neurons , called presynaptic partners and postsynaptic partners .

However , mAbs can also bind to another protein called a light chain , which is found on the surface of the

The visual cortex is a region of the brain that is responsible for processing visual information . It consists of two parts: the primary visual cortex ( or FEF for short ) and the early visual cortex ( or ROI for short ) . Both FEF and ROI are important for processing visual information , but it is not clear how the FEF and ROI interact with each other during visual processing .

Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord . It is caused by mutations in a gene called MECP2 , which encodes a protein called MeCP2 , which is found in neurons called excitatory neurons . In mice with Rett syndrome , MeCP2 is absent in excitatory neurons , but it is present in inhibitory neurons , which are responsible for communication between the brain and the rest of the body . However , it is not clear how the absence of MeCP2 in excitatory neurons leads to Rett syndrome . One possibility is that

Genes are made up of two sets of DNA , each of which contains a set of instructions to make proteins and other molecules . When a gene is switched on or off , the instructions are translated into messenger ribonucleic acid ( or mRNA ) molecules , which are then used to make proteins .

These regions can also influence the levels of mRNA molecules in the cell , but it is not clear how they do this . To

The membrane that surrounds a cell is made up of a network of proteins called actin filaments . The actin filaments are attached to the cell membrane by a protein called WASP , which is found on the inside surface of the cell . When WASP binds to the actin filaments , it activates a protein called Arp2/3 complex , which then nucleates new actin filaments from the sides of the existing actin filaments .

The human immune system is able to detect and respond to viral infections , but it is not always able to stop the virus from replicating . To do so , the immune system relies on proteins called pattern recognition receptors ( or RLRs for short ) . RLRs detect the presence of viral RNA molecules in the cell’s cytoplasm and trigger an immune response .

The RcsF complex is made up of a lipidated domain on the cell surface and a periplasmic domain on the cell

Anesthesia is often used to help patients recover from surgery or other medical procedures , but it can also cause them to become unconscious . This is because the brain is unable to respond to the anesthetic , and the brain is unable to communicate with the rest of the body . It is not clear exactly how this happens , but it has been suggested that the brain’s ability to communicate with the rest of the body is disrupted when the brain is deprived of anesthesia . To investigate this idea , researchers have used a drug called dexmedetomidine , which is commonly used as an anesthetic in surgery .

The DNA inside cells is wrapped around proteins called histones , which are found on the surface of the cell membrane . Histones are made up of a group of amino acids called lysines , which are found on the surface of most proteins . However , a group of amino acids called acetyl groups can also be found on histones .

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy , with 21 , 290 estimated new cases and 14 , 180 estimated deaths in the United States in 2015 . However , only 5% of 570 women in a large ovarian cancer screening randomized trial who underwent surgical evaluation actually had a malignancy . This means that it is not possible to accurately predict which women will develop ovarian cancer and which will not . Therefore , it is important to find out if a woman with ovarian cancer has a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein called CA-125 . Mutations in the gene that encodes CA-125 are

The human body is made up of two parts: the brain and the muscles that control movement . The brain is made up of a large area of tissue called the cortex , and the muscles are made up of a smaller area called the somatotopy . The somatotopy is thought to be responsible for the sense of touch and sensation , but it is not clear how this information is transmitted to the muscles . The somatotopy is also thought to be responsible for the sense of proprioception , which is the ability of the body to sense the position of other objects in the environment .

The Golgi complex is a major transport station for proteins and other molecules in the cell . The Golgi complex consists of stacks of flat membranous cisternae , which are surrounded by a network of membrane-bound compartments called tubules and vesicles . The cargo proteins , such as albumin and VSVG , are transported through the Golgi complex by a process called cisternal progression . However , it is not clear exactly how the cargo proteins move through the Golgi complex . Previous studies have shown that the cargo proteins move by cisternal progression , but it is not clear how

The development of a cell is a complex process , and it is often difficult to predict how a cell will behave in the future .

However , when a gene is inactive , the promoter of the gene is not active , and the transcription of the gene is not initiated . This means that a small number of genes may be transcribed as early as 8–12 weeks of development . However , it is

DNA is the building blocks of every cell in the body , and it contains all the information needed to make proteins and other molecules . However , when DNA is damaged , it can be difficult to repair it . This is partly because the DNA is so tightly packed , and it is difficult to move it around the cell . To repair damaged DNA , a protein called PARP1 is needed . PARP1 binds to two different DNA sites at the same time , and then moves along the DNA to release the damaged DNA . However , it is not clear how this process works

Neurons contain a network of cells called axons , which are surrounded by a plasma membrane . The plasma membrane separates the cell from the rest of the cell , and allows ions to pass through . This allows the cell to communicate with other parts of the body , such as the brain . However , when a cell divides , the plasma membrane separates from the rest of the cell , and the cell can no longer communicate with the rest of the cell . This causes the cell to become more active , which can lead to changes in the electrical activity of the cell . This can

However , mutations that block the fusion of vacuoles in wild-type strains of yeast cause the cells to have fewer than a few large vacuoles , which means that the cells are unable to fuse together . This means that the cells have to form many smaller vacuoles , which can lead to cell death . One way that yeast cells can fuse together is by using a protein called HOPS , which is found on the surface of the vacuoles . However , it is not

When a fly is hungry , it will extend its proboscis , a behavior that allows the fly to taste a potential food source . However , when the fly is starved , it will not extend its proboscis , but will instead extend its probosi , a behavior that allows the fly to taste a potential food source . This behavior is known as the ‘appetitive response’ . However , it is not clear whether this behavior is required for the fly to taste a potential food source , or if it is simply a response to the fly’s internal state

A protein called AANAT1 is found in the brain of many animals , including humans , and it is thought to play a role in regulating sleep . However , it is not clear exactly how AANAT1 regulates sleep . To investigate this question , researchers used a technique called RNA interference ( or RNAi for short ) to disrupt the activity of AANAT1 in the brain of fruit flies . The results showed that the activity of AANAT1 was reduced in the brain of fruit flies when they were awake , but not when they were asleep . This suggests that the activity of AANAT

The genome of fruit flies is made up of two sets of chromosomes , each of which contains a set of genes . Each set of chromosomes contains a region of DNA called an insulator , which acts as a barrier between the two sets of chromosomes . Previous studies have shown that insulator proteins can bind to each other in regions of the fly genome that are called topologically associated domains , or TADs for short . However , it was not clear how these insulator proteins bind to each other , or how the insulator proteins interact with each other to form TADs . To address this question ,

Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the brain and spinal cord , and is caused by mutations in a gene called LRRK2 . Mutations in LRRK2 can lead to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta region of the midbrain , a region of the brain that is important for learning and memory . Mutations in LRRK2 can also lead to other neurodegenerative diseases , such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease .

Cells store energy in the form of ATP , a molecule that is essential for many processes in the body . Most ATP production occurs within mitochondria , which are structures that range from interconnected networks to individual globular structures that extend throughout the cell . In neurons , for instance , mitochondria are found at the nodes of Ranvier , which can be spaced hundreds of micrometers apart . It has been suggested that mitochondria can stop producing ATP if glucose levels are too high , but it is not clear how this happens . To answer this question , Zhang et al . have now developed a mathematical model that

Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer in men . It is caused by the abnormal growth of prostate cells , which can be caused by the hormone androgen .

The status signalling hypothesis is a popular theory in evolutionary biology that suggests that certain species of birds communicate with each other by displaying a badge of status . This badge of status can be seen as a sign that the bird is more likely to be successful , or that the bird is less likely to be unsuccessful . Previous studies have shown that the badge of status is not a sign of success , but rather a signal that the bird is less likely to be successful . However , it is not clear whether the badge of status is actually a sign of success , or whether it is a signal that the bird is less

The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system is a powerful tool that can be used to edit genes in a wide range of organisms , including humans , animals and plants .

For example , in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , only 20% of the genes in the fly’s genome are associated with alleles , or mutations , that can lead to diseases such as cancer . This means that the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system can only be used to edit a small fraction of

The brain is made up of two systems: the goal-directed system and the habit system . The goal-directed system learns how the reward depends on the action selected in a given state , and we refer to it as ‘goal-directed’ , because it can infer actions that typically lead to the desired reward . The habit system learns to predict action on the basis of a state , so its prediction error encodes how the currently chosen action differs from a habitual action in the given state . The goal-directed system learns to predict action on the basis of a state , so its prediction error encode

European beech forests are a habitat for more than 6000 different species of animals and plants . However , many of these species are at risk from drought , which is becoming more frequent and prolonged due to climate change . To investigate this , researchers collected DNA samples from 402 European beech trees in the Czech Republic between 1950 and 2019 . The samples were then compared to the DNA of healthy and drought-damaged beech trees . The results showed that , even in the same stand , drought-damaged and healthy trees were neighbours . This suggests that the genetic diversity of the beech forests is important for the survival of

Disturbed flow , which occurs in areas where atherosclerosis develops , is associated with low time-averaged shear stress and is ‘athero-susceptible’ promoting EC ‘activation’ characterized by inflammation and reduced vascular barrier integrity . Disturbed flow is also associated with low time-averaged shear stress and is ‘athero-protective’

The immune system is made up of many different types of cells , including white blood cells , red blood cells , and B cells . B cells recognize and destroy invading microbes , while white blood cells and red blood cells recognize and destroy pathogens . However , unlike B cells , white blood cells and red blood cells do not recognize small molecules . Instead , B cells recognize molecules called antigens , which are molecules that are produced by microbes , and mount a response to them . However , unlike B cells , white blood cells and red blood cells do not recognize haptens

Cells called phagocytic immune cells are responsible for killing invading bacteria , viruses and fungi . However , it is still not clear how these cells do this . One way to do this is to use a protein called roGFP2-Orp1 , which is found in the cytoplasm of E . coli bacteria . The roGFP2-Orp1 protein binds to a group of molecules called the glutathione redox couple , which is found in hydrogen peroxide . When the glutathione redox couple binds to the roGFP2-Orp1 protein , it oxidizes , which causes the protein to change its fluorescence

A protein called Ubp1 is found on the surface of the cell membrane . When Ubp1 is overexpressed in cells , it helps to stabilize the levels of a protein called Hrd1 , which is found on the surface of the cell membrane . However , when Ubp1 is not overexpressed in cells , Hrd1 levels are very low . This is because the Ubp1 protein is made up of two distinct polypeptides , one with a transmembrane segment and the other without it . The Ubp1 protein is found on the surface of the cell membrane .

Mutations in a protein called mutp53 can lead to cancer . Mutations in mutp53 are found in a large number of human cancers , including lung and colorectal cancers . Mutations in mutp53 can also lead to low levels of a protein called wtp53 in normal cells and tissues . However , it is not clear how mutp53 accumulates in tumors . Previous studies have shown that a protein called MDM2 plays a critical role in maintaining low levels of mutp53 in normal cells and tissues . However , it is not clear how mut

Pain is one of the most common symptoms of osteoarthritis ( OA ) , a condition in which the cartilage in the knee becomes worn away . The cartilage in the knee is made up of small bones called subchondral bones , which are made up of cells called osteoblastic cells . In OA , the subchondral bones become too thin , which causes the cartilage to break down , leading to pain . Previous studies have shown that a protein called prostaglandin E2 ( or PGE2 for short ) plays an important role in the formation of subchondral bones .

When a cell divides , the DNA in the nucleus is copied to make new copies of the genes that make up the cell . This process , known as recombination , is important for many biological processes , including reproduction and cell division . However , it is not clear exactly how recombination occurs , and whether it is regulated by a protein called PRDM9 . PRDM9 is found in the nucleus of human sperm and egg cells , and it can bind to DNA and trimethylate histones , the proteins that make up the DNA in the nucleus . However , it is not

Tinnitus is an involuntary ringing in the ears that occurs when a sound is too loud or too slow . It is thought that tinnitus is caused by changes in the activity of a type of brain cell called the dorsal cochlear nucleus principal neurons , or DCN fusiform cells for short . DCN fusiform cells are found in the inner ear , and their activity is regulated by a protein called KCNQ2/3 . Previous studies have shown that DCN fusiform cells are sensitive to noise . However , it was not clear how DCN fusiform cells respond to noise . To

Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria , fungi and viruses . However , some bacteria can become resistant to these drugs , which makes it difficult to treat infections caused by these bacteria . This means that antibiotics must be used in a sequential manner . This means that , for example , one antibiotic can be used to treat infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to a second antibiotic , while another antibiotic can be used to treat infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to a third antibiotic . However , it is not clear how this process works . To investigate this question ,

Parkinson’s disease is caused by mutations in two genes , PINK1 and parkin , which are involved in a process called mitophagy . PINK1 and parkin work together to degrade damaged mitochondria , the energy-producing structures in cells , in a process called autophagy . However , it was not clear whether mitophagy also occurs in muscle cells and dopaminergic neurons , which are involved in movement . To answer this question , researchers used a technique called mt-Keima imaging to image muscle cells and dopaminergic neurons in the laboratory . The images

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain’s ability to control movement . The symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include tremors , rigidity and loss of balance . Previous studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease have a higher rate of activity in a region of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus , which is responsible for controlling movement . However , it was not clear whether this increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus is related to the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease . To address this question , a group of researchers recruited patients with Parkinson’s disease to

Neuroblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called NF1 . Mutations in the NF1 gene can lead to the development of neuroblastoma tumors , which are often difficult to treat . The NF1 gene encodes a protein called GTPase , which is involved in regulating the activity of other proteins . GTPase is also involved in controlling the growth of nerve cells in the brain , called the superior cervical ganglia ( or SCG for short ) . However , it is not clear what role GTPase plays in controlling

The brain is made up of many different types of cells , each with its own set of structures . For example , neurons have a structure called the nucleus accumbens shell , which is made up of many branches .

However , it is not clear whether the structure of the nucleus accumbens shell also plays a role in migraine . One way to investigate this question is to use a mouse model of migraine , called chronic non-migraine headache ( or

The X chromosome is one of the most important genes in a cell , and it encodes the instructions needed to make proteins and other molecules . However , the X chromosome contains only one copy of the gene that encodes this protein . This means that if a male has only one copy of the gene , it would be less likely that he would be able to perform the same tasks as a female . To compensate for this , researchers have proposed a mechanism that would increase the expression of the X chromosome in males . This would allow the male to perform the same tasks as a female . However

DNA is the building block of all living things , and it is essential for many processes in the body , including the production of proteins . DNA is made up of two strands of single-stranded DNA , each of which contains a protein called a nucleoprotein . When a nucleoprotein binds to a strand of DNA , it forms a filament called pol V Mut . This filament is then used as a template to make new nucleoproteins , which can then be used to make proteins . However , it is not clear how pol V Mut forms .

Previous studies have shown that semen and seminal fluid can influence the development of the eye . However , it was not clear whether semen and seminal fluid also affect the development of the eye . To investigate this question , Zhang et al . used a technique called functional enrichment ,

Nerve impulses travel from the brain to the spinal cord and then to the muscles that control movement . However , when the spinal cord is injured , the nerve impulses that travel from the brain to the spinal cord are blocked . This means that the muscles that control movement become less sensitive to the nerve impulses that travel from the brain to the spinal cord . This means that the muscles that control movement become less sensitive to the nerve impulses that travel from the brain to the spinal cord . This means that the muscles that control movement become less sensitive to the nerve impulses that travel from the brain to the spinal cord . This

Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria , fungi and viruses . However , they can also be used to treat infections caused by other bacteria , fungi and viruses that are resistant to the drugs . This means that antibiotics are no longer effective in treating infections caused by bacteria , fungi and viruses that are resistant to the drugs . In low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) , antibiotic use is increasing with rising incomes , affordable antimicrobials and the lack of stewardship in hospital and poor control of over-the-counter sales .

To investigate this question , researchers sequenced the genomes of 60 different strains of Rhodococcus , which were collected from different locations across the world , and compared them to the genomes of the other strains . The results showed that the two strains that can cause disease in over 100 genera of plants are distinct

The human brain processes information in two ways: first , it encodes the information in the form of electrical signals , and then it processes the information in the form of chemical signals . This process is known as the prestimulus response , and it is thought that the prestimulus response is triggered by an activation of the sensory areas of the brain . However , it is not clear how the prestimulus response is generated . One possibility is that the prestimulus response is triggered by an increase in the electrical activity in the visual areas of the brain . However ,

Malaria is one of the leading causes of death and disease in sub-Saharan Africa , and the number of cases of the disease has been declining in recent years . However , the number of babies born with low birth weight in sub-Saharan Africa has remained high . This is partly because many first-borns in sub-Saharan Africa have low birth weight , and because many first-borns in sub-Saharan Africa live in areas with high rates of malaria . This is partly because many first-borns in sub-Saharan Africa live in areas with high rates of malaria , and because many first

Proteins are made up of a series of molecules called kleisins , which bind to each other to form complexes . The kleisins are then used to break down the DNA , which is then released from the cell . Proteins called kleisin complexes bind to the kleisins in a way that allows the kleisins to interact with each other . However , it is not clear how the kleisins interact with the kleisins , and how the kleisins interact with the kleisins of the kleisin complexes .

The axon is a structure in the brain and spinal cord that is made up of a series of structures called growth cones . When axons are injured , they undergo a series of changes in the structure , including the formation of new growth cones . These changes are essential for the axon to regenerate , but they can also inhibit the regeneration process . A protein called EFA-6 , which is found in yeast and in mammals , is thought to be involved in the regeneration of axons . EFA-6 binds to two proteins called TAC-1 and ZYG-8 ,

The olfactory system is the first layer in the sensory system , and is responsible for transmitting information about smells to higher levels of the brain . The cells that make up the olfactory system are called olfactory receptor neurons , and they are responsible for detecting and responding to odors . When an odorant is present in the environment , it binds to the olfactory receptor neurons and activates them . However , when the odorant is present in a mixture of different molecules , it can also bind to the receptor neurons and cause them to respond in a different way . This is known as the ensemble ORN response .

Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that helps the immune system to fight off invading bacteria and other pathogens . Macrophages are also capable of destroying other cells in the body , such as cancer cells . However , it is not clear how macrophages respond to an infection .

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women , and is caused by mutations in the genes that encode proteins called TP53 . Mutations in TP53 can lead to cancer cells becoming resistant to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin , which is used to treat lung cancer . Previous studies have shown that lung cancer cells that are resistant to cisplatin have higher levels of proteins called p38 and ERK than normal cells . However , it was not clear how these proteins are activated in lung cancer cells . To investigate this question , researchers used a model that mimics the effects of

Neurons receive information from other neurons in the form of patterns of activation of different synaptic inputs . For instance , in vitro studies have shown that near-simultaneous stimulation of a group of spatially clustered excitatory synapses on a thin dendritic branch can elicit supralinear , prolonged membrane depolarizations in the soma . These non-linear responses to spatiotemporally clustered synaptic input can induce synaptic plasticity . Calcium influx into neuronal dendrites and spines is a critical mechanism linking synaptic input patterns to synaptic plasticity , as calcium is required for most forms of neuronal plasticity

Many species accumulate pigments that absorb ultraviolet radiation in their flowers; while these patterns are invisible to the human eye , they can be perceived by pollinators , most of which can be seen in the near UV . Besides their importance for pollinator attraction , patterns of UV-absorbing pigments in flowers have increasingly been recognized to have a role in responses to other biotic and abiotic factors , including defence against insect herbivory , protection against UV radiation , and adaptation to different temperatures . To better understand the function and genetic regulation of variation for floral UV pigmentation , we focused on two widespread species of annual sunflowers

Coronary artery disease is a major cause of death worldwide . It is caused by the narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the heart , which can lead to a blockage of the blood supply to the heart . This blockage can lead to a rupture of the coronary artery , which can lead to death . Previous studies have shown that coronary artery disease can be detected using a technique called optical coherence tomography ( or OCT for short ) . However , it was not clear whether this technique could also be used to detect coronary artery disease . To address this question , Chen et al . used a technique

The first few weeks of an animal’s life are critical for the development of its nervous system . This period is marked by the establishment and functional maturation of several neurocircuits in rodent models , representing a critical period in which these circuits are particularly amenable to modification by environmental stimuli .

In the winter , ground squirrels , also known as hibernators , hibernate for up to two weeks . During this period , their body temperature falls to just above ambient , even as ambient temperatures fall to near freezing . This allows the squirrels to survive , but it is not clear how the hibernation process works . To find out , researchers used a technique called digital transcriptome analysis to precisely measure the abundance of RNA molecules in the blood of hibernators . The analysis revealed that the abundance of RNA molecules in the blood of hibernators fluctuates between periods of low body temperature and

Genes are made up of long stretches of DNA , which contain chemical tags called methyl groups . These tags help the DNA to stick to the surface of the cell so that it can be read by the cell’s machinery . However , when a gene is switched on or off , the methyl groups are removed . This process is known as methylation , and it is thought that the loss of methyl groups can lead to changes in the activity of genes . However , it is not clear exactly how this process works , and it is not clear whether it is linked to the immune system .

Stem cells are specialized cells that can develop into any type of cell in the body . However , unlike other cells , stem cells do not divide to produce a single cell .

The ability to swim is essential for many animals , including humans , to survive and thrive in the wild . However , the ability to swim is impaired in some animals , such as humans , when they are injured . This is because the neurons in the neural circuit that generates the swimming pattern are not able to communicate with each other . This means that the swimming pattern is disrupted , and the animals are unable to perform the movements they need to survive . This is because the neurons in the neural circuit that generates the swimming pattern are not able to communicate with each other . This means that the

When an egg is fertilized , a protein called Bcd is released from the nucleus of the egg . This protein is then translated into messenger RNA ( or mRNA ) molecules , which are then used to make proteins . However , when the egg is fertilized , the Bcd protein is only translated when the egg is laid . This means that the Bcd protein is only translated when the egg is fertilized .

Proteins are molecules of DNA that contain instructions to make proteins . However , many proteins are made up of RNA molecules , which are made up of two or more copies of the same DNA sequence . These RNA molecules bind to each other to form long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , which can be used as templates to make proteins . However , lncRNAs are often present at relatively low copy numbers , which makes it difficult to study how lncRNAs work . One lncRNA called c-Myc regulates the activity of a protein called CC

Many animals , including humans and mice , age rapidly . However , the rate of aging is modulated by a number of factors , including the amount of nutrients available to the cell , the pH of the water in the cell , and the number of proteins in the cell . The daughter cells of the mother cell , on the other hand , do not age rapidly . Instead , they reset their pH , reorganize their mitochondria , and reset their ability to divide . The daughter cells also reset their ability to keep their DNA circles in the mother cell . However , it

This is known as the “protein-burden effect” , and it has been suggested that if a protein is overexpressed too much , it can cause growth defects . However , it is not clear whether the protein-

Microorganisms , such as bacteria and yeast , often cooperate with each other to produce chemicals that benefit other cells . For example , in the bacterium cerevisiae , which is found in the intestines of humans , only 1% of the molecules that hydrolyze the bacteria are imported into the cell that hydrolyzes them , with the rest diffusing away . This is because the bacteria that hydrolyzes the bacteria have a long side in common with the other cells in the colony , which means that the molecules that hydrolyze the bacteria are more likely to diffuse to the other cells

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of a protein called -amyloid peptide in the brain .

Most of the traits that we see in animals and plants are the result of evolution , which is the process of changing the genetic make-up of an organism over time . For example , some traits , such as the ability to grow and reproduce , evolve over time . However , others , such as the ability to maintain a stable protein structure , evolve over time . This is because the forces of selection and mutation are constant , which means that these traits will evolve over time . However , it is not clear whether these forces of selection and mutation are constant over time .

In everyday life , we constantly engage in learning processes in which the possibility to obtain an external reward is mostly absent . If neither external feedback regarding the learning success nor external reward is given , some internal system must still decide whether the output of the learning experience is valid and should thus be stored into long-term memory . Moreover , as adult learners , we also constantly face the problem of learning the meaning of new-words in our own native or non-native languages , and in most cases , the repeated presentation of a new-word in different verbal contexts can allow to discover the meaning of the

However , it is not clear how these viruses are cleared from the blood of mice . Previous studies have shown that the liver of mice infected with chikungunya , Ross River , and o’nyong ‘nyong viruses contains a large number of cells called Kupffer cells , which can detect and remove particles of the virus from the blood

The muscles and joints of animals are made up of cartilage , which is made up of proteins called chondrocytes . These proteins bind to a receptor on the surface of the cell , called the chondrocyte receptor , and activate the chondrocyte receptor . The chondrocyte receptor binds to a protein called Pent , which is found on the surface of the cell . Pent binds to a protein called HSPG , which is found on the surface of the cell , and activates the chondrocyte receptor . However , it is not clear how Pen

RNA is a molecule of genetic information that is made up of four bases . The four bases are called nucleotides , and they can be added to the RNA molecule by a process called template-directed polymerization . However , it is not clear how this process works , and it has been difficult to measure the rate at which the four bases are added to the RNA molecule . To overcome this problem , researchers have developed a method that allows the four bases to be added to the RNA molecule at the same time . The method involves adding two of the four bases to the RNA molecule at the same time

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2 , which is transmitted from person to person by droplets of virus-contaminated water . The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein , which is found on the surface of human cells , is thought to play a role in the development of COVID-19 . However , it is not clear how the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with the human CD209 protein , which is found on the surface of human cells . To investigate this question , the researchers used a technique called genetic colocalisation , which

Niemann-Pick type C is a disease that affects yeast cells . It is caused by a mutation in a gene that encodes a protein called NPC1 , which is involved in transporting cholesterol from the cell’s lumen to the cell’s limiting membrane . The NPC1 gene encodes a protein called NPC2 , which is also involved in transporting cholesterol from the cell’s lumen to the cell’s limiting membrane . However , it is not clear how NPC2 and NPC1 work together to transport cholesterol from the cell’s lumen to the limiting membrane . To investigate this question ,

The SARS-CoV-2 virus , which originated in China in late 2019 , has caused an increase in mortality among elderly patients and individuals with comorbid conditions . However , it has not yet been confirmed that the virus is responsible for this increase in mortality . To address this issue , researchers have developed a new test that can detect the presence of mutant versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus . The test is based on a technique called lateral flow sequencing , which uses a nanoparticle to move up and down a strip of DNA . Lateral flow sequencing is a technique that uses a nanoparticle to move up

The digestive system of fruit flies is made up of a network of cells called enteric neurons . The enteric neurons are located in the gut , and are responsible for controlling the amount of food that flies eat . However , it is not clear how the enteric neurons in the gut regulate the amount of food that flies eat . Previous studies have shown that a protein called PPK1 is present in a subset of enteric neurons , called the posterior enteric neurons ( PENs ) . However , it was not clear whether PPK1 is involved in regulating the amount of food that flies

The human immune system is made up of a number of different types of cells , including B cells and T cells . These cells are able to recognize and destroy a wide range of pathogens , including viruses , bacteria and parasites . However , it is not clear exactly how B cells and T cells respond to these pathogens . One possibility is that B cells and T cells are able to produce antibodies that can bind to and neutralize a wide range of pathogens . However , it is not clear exactly how B cells and T cells are able to produce antibodies that can bind to and neutralize a wide range of pathogens

The DNA inside a cell is tightly wrapped around proteins and other molecules called nucleosomes . This prevents the DNA from being copied , which is essential for the cell’s survival and growth . However , this barrier can also be overcome by modifying the nucleosomes , which allows the DNA to be copied more easily . A protein called Chd1 plays a key role in this process . Chd1 binds to a protein called PolII , which is found on the surface of the nucleosomes . PolII also helps to break down the nucleosomes , which allows the DNA

Many complex environmental responses have recently been discovered in plants , including luring in animal predators to attack herbivores in response to herbivory , production of toxins in response to distress signals from kin , and dose-dependent responses to insufficient water or excess salt in the soil .

The brain is made up of many different regions , each with its own unique characteristics . For example , the lateral prefrontal cortex ( or DLPFC for short ) is a region of the brain that is involved in decision-making . It is important to understand how the brain responds to different types of stimuli , such as eye movements , to help us understand how the brain works . Previous studies have shown that the DLPFC responds to eye movements more rapidly than other regions of the brain . However , it was not clear how the DLPFC responds to eye movements .
