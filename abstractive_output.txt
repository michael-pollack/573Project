Seasonality is a measure of the number of deaths that occur in a given year . For example , in the United States , the number of deaths in the winter months exceeds those in the summer months . Seasonality is well-established , but there is limited information on how it varies by local climate and how these features have changed over time , especially in relation to age group , sex and medical cause of death . To address this question , we used wavelet and centre of gravity analyses to identify seasonal differences in the number of deaths in the United States .

Herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ) is the most common cause of eye infections in humans . The virus infects the cornea , the clear outer layer of the eye , and causes inflammation , scarring and loss of vision . However , it is not clear how HSV-1 infection affects the cornea . Previous studies have shown that the immune system can infiltrate the cornea , but it was not clear how this infiltrates the cornea . To address this question , a mouse model of HSV-1 infection was used to study how the immune system infiltrates the cornea . The immune system is

The herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is a common cause of cold sores , but it can also cause other diseases . For example , herpes simplex virus infection can lead to a condition called herpes simplex immunodeficiency , in which the immune system is unable to fight off the virus . This condition is caused by mutations in a gene called HOIL-1 , which encodes a protein called amylopectin , which helps the immune system to fight off the virus . However , it is not clear how HOIL-1 is involved in the development of herpes simplex immunodeficiency .

The frontal lobe is a region of the brain that is involved in the planning and execution of complex tasks . The frontal lobe is divided into four regions: the medial frontal lobe , the orbitofrontal lobe , the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and the anterior cingulate cortex . Previous studies have shown that the medial frontal lobe and the anterior cingulate cortex are involved in the planning and execution of complex tasks , while the orbitofrontal lobe and the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe are involved in the planning and execution of simple tasks . However , it is not clear how the frontal

The protein myosin 5 , which is found in the brain and spinal cord , is one of the most abundant proteins in the body . It is also one of the most active proteins in the cell , and is involved in many processes , including cell division , cell division and cell death . However , it is not known exactly how the myosin 5 molecule moves . To investigate this , researchers have developed a technique called interferometric scattering microscopy ( or iSCAT for short ) , which allows them to visualize the movement of the myosin 5 molecule as it
